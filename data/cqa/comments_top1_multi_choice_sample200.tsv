Teenage boy bedroom stink; when did your room stop stinking? How did it not bother you?	answer1: I didn’t know dudes like that exist Fuck... stashing trash under the bed Wearing shit and stashing it Basically living in a basement environment with the dark conditions Why do guys do that unless they’re depressed	answer2: It similar to the problem of people with chronic body odour.... A lot of them don’t know they have it or how bad it is. He probably needs a shock from someone... Hearing an outsider saying how bad it is, something like that.
Men who were beaten as a punishment as a child, how has it effected you growing up?	answer1: I don't hold grudges, it fucked me up in the short term but ultimately saved me from going down the wrong path. Makes me sad when I see kids acting out and knowing their parents will give in and reward them for being less cunty. Slap the little shits and if they cry, slap them again.	answer2: Grandfather was a sweet man. I was being a shithead once and he spanked my butt. One smack. I never gave him attitude again. There is a huge gap between spanking your child once and beating them till they're bruised.
Do you ever sit down and ,all of the sudden, you can smell your genitals?	answer1: This is what I call the "dank as fuck" moment even if it's not that moist down there (though it's more obvious when it's damp). It's so noticeable to me that I get paranoid that maybe other people can smell it too. It's that mix of sweat, vaginal secretions and that general genital smell (it's hard to describe that genital smell, I've smelled it on my boyfriend while giving head which made me think "oh gee, penises and vaginas really are of the same stock, even in scent! If I was going down on a woman would she also smell like this? I guess we all smell like this!") Ok I digress...	answer2: I don't mean this to be cruel, but I don't understand why no one else would smell it if you do, through your clothes. If anything, people tend to have issues smelling themselves when others do. To answer, no.
How do you stay interesting as an adult?	answer1: One of the best things of getting older is that you run out of fucks to give about whether other people will find you interesting or not. As long as *you're* not bored with whatever it is you're doing - it's really kind of irrelevant how other people feel about it.	answer2: Drop the video games. Nobody ever gets to the end of their lives and says, "I wish I had played more video games." Travel, volunteer, get outside, find an activity you enjoy and dive into it, join a club, learn an instrument, learn a language, take a course, learn a new skill. Get out there and live life. It's an amazing thing.
What is your worst story of "good person" is actually trash in a relationship?	answer1: I had this friend, her husband was abusive, but nobody believe her at first because in public he was this amazing guy everyone was crazy about him, It took a trip to the emergency room with all her ribs broken to people realize it was an act, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her there he destroyed her face, he had the guts to say that she threw herself down stairs to blame him . The officer who arrested him said: oh really? how many times she did it.	answer2: My bf - or now ex as of an hour ago - is the most liked person everywhere. He seems like such a good person on the surface. So kind and caring. All he cares about is himself and not feeling bad though. He just broke up with me after booking a holiday to go meet his mum in France. After postponing us moving in together bc he wasn't ready yet but definitely wanted to. We were going to Japan for Christmas. I met all of his family last Christmas 6 months into dating. I'm sorry, I'm very distressed rn
How do your personal experiences clash with the common consensus you see on the Internet?	answer1: I honestly don't believe there's such a thing as a radical feminist, and cherrypicked tumblr posts aren't evidence. Feminism is about equal rights, and the majority of people that go on reddit are feminists, even if they don't classify themselves as ones.	answer2: Internet dating is difficult. I know so many couples that have met via it. (we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, and met 4 other couples who meet via okcupid)
What is a time you have witnessed a secret blow up in everyone's faces?	answer1: I worked with a chick who had a boyfriend in another country LongDistance. so while she was in that she started dating my BIL, then the LD came to visit for a while and by some weird coincidence she got pregnant like a week before he came so when she pretended like it was his but went and got an abortion and continued this weird relationship with both of them... eventually the LD found out i think it was by some text or something she left open on her iphone which connected to her laptop and the guy was furious broke up with her treated her like shit afterwards.... I always thought he was a good guy and never deserved that but I couldn't tell him anything because then i'd have to deal with her every day at work...	answer2: My sister's multiple affairs came out when my dad was in the hospital. We were all sitting there for hours, and she kept getting different phone call "rings" in front of her then-husband. Then 'friend #1' stopped by, then 'friend #2' stops by... she was milking the 'my father is in the hospital' pity card and it backfired because all three showed up at the same time at the hospital.
What cultural stereotypes have you never seen or experienced, thus makes you wonder why that stereotype exists?	answer1: As a brown guy, am I seriously supposed to think that Japanese, Chinese and Korean people are the “racist” ones? Lmao	answer2: The stereotype that says immigrants are lazy and just want to live off welfare. (And yet somehow steal all the jobs?) I know two women who came here from Venezuela and they're both university educated and own their own businesses. My mom was an immigrant herself and she was always employed and made money as an artist on the side. The foreign business owners where I work (mall) are polite and run their stores well. The only person I know who faked a disability for benefits and stayed at home to chain smoke and chug Mt. Dew all day? My stepmother whose family had been here for generations.
Men who currently date, or have dated a black girl, have you ever had problems from black men?	answer1: Lots of black women get angry at black men who date outside their race. The main two groups of people who have the highest percentage not in a relationship are black women and Asian men. So when a black guy, especially one with his life together goes outside of their race it's seen as being a race traitor.	answer2: Whitey here, been married to a black woman for 4 years. I can count the number of times she's been approached by a black man in front of me on one hand, and even fewer times did they mention my ethnicity. She's taller than me, that gets mentioned more often than our races. BTW White man/Black woman couples have the lowest divorce rate of any mixed ethnicity combo.
Ladies who are chronically single, what do you think is the reason for that?	answer1: I’ve not met someone who likes me when I like them. I’m comfortable being single and living my life. I’m not willing to lower my standards just to be in a relationship. I’ve broken up with guys in the past because I’d rather be single then in a shitty relationship or to be treated poorly.	answer2: im triggered by your terminology but the reason i am single is because i want to be. I am dating a few men but nothing serious because ive already been married and divorced and want none of that ever again
Do you ever get offended by the standard of men who show interest in you?	answer1: I'm not offended by men showing interest in me, I'm offended based on HOW they show interest. I won't get upset at someone mentioning it casually, in fact I'll be flattered. However, if you catcall me on the street at 7am because you think I have a nice ass, go fall off a cliff.	answer2: offended when they show interest, no. offended when they actually try to pursue me as if they have a reasonable chance, absolutely.
Men with long eyelashes as a side effect of being hairy, how often do women wish they could steal your lashes?	answer1: I hear this nearly every day and it's just something I've some to live with. I get it now. It used to make me angry when people would insist I was wearing mascara and eyeliner. Later I used it to my advantage and had all the dates. Now it's just a part of my day for someone to want my eyelashes.	answer2: All the fucking time dude, like holy shit. My wife has always been jelous of my eye lashes, says they are wasted on me. We had a daughter a few years ago, and she 100% got my eyelashes. I told my wife that I wasn't wasting them, just saving them to give to her
What was the defining moment that made you realise your S/O was "The One"?	answer1: I'm a man but I don't think there is a "one." I think it's completely random who you end up meeting and you may or may not find someone you can spend your life with. And if you do, it may still fail after a period of time. There is no magical right person made specifically to compliment you. Sorry	answer2: For me, it was actually the other day. We had gotten into a mini argument a few minutes before, and I wondered out loud if I was worth it for him because I know how stressful my mood swings and irritability can be. As soon as I asked if I was worth it, he started crying. Began telling me that he didn't understand how I could ever think I'm NOT worth it when I'm everything to him, when I make him feel happier and more loved than anyone else ever could. I started crying too, and I couldn't be more sure.
Happy (U.S.) gay marriage day! Lady-lovin-ladies, what would your ideal (and now legal!) same-sex wedding look like?	answer1: I'm currently with a man that I love, but I have the potential to love women as well. I can't wait to find my soulmate, whoever they are, and ~~obsessively control~~ have our wedding! Congratulations to all the women here who can finally realize their dreams! :)	answer2: Well, since the government is coming in to divorce me from my husband and force me to get gay-married, I might as well start taking advice from here and plan now. (/s)
What was that moment when you were like "aaaaand definitely going to break up with you"?	answer1: When she told me she didn't want me to become the president of my Unis gaming club because it would take too much of my time. Ignoring the fact it was my dream job and I had been wanting it for over a year and a half.	answer2: When she had quit her third job in 3 months because her boss was some version of out to get her. Girl, there is a pattern here and it's you. I can't pay your half of the rent for the next six months.
What everyday objects are not designed with women in mind?	answer1: # Status: Unlocked After Moderation Clean-Up. # Please report all rule-breaking comments. &#x200B; All of the rules are still in effect.

Has anyone encountered more misogyny from women?	answer1: Not personally, no. It greatly depends on perceptions and worldviews and family beliefs and stuff, though, I'm sure, as a few people have called my family dynamic 'sexist,' from Mom, Dad, and siblings alike	answer2: I feel as though it's common for people to feel the need to keep members of their own gender "in check." As such I've noticed that a lot of women say sexist shit to other women, and a lot of men say sexist shit to other men. I'm not a fan of it and I try not to feed into it though.
Why does it seem like society is more accepting of girls with masculine hobbies than boys with feminine hobbies?	answer1: A lot of posts here suggest that it's because "masculinity is seen as superior". OK fine. But I think the sentence needs to go further, since "superior *at what*, exactly?" It is more accurate to say that masculinity is *more attractive to women*, and being attractive to women is what men really care about. A *lot*. If a woman is into axe-throwing or rock-climbing, it is unlikely to impact how attractive she is to men. It might even make her more attractive. If a man is into flower-arranging or knitting or does pilates, it is very likely to negatively impact how attractive he is to women. Hence, both women and men are more accepting of women with masculine hobbies, because girls can do anything. Both women and men are against men with feminine hobbies because *both* sexes think feminine hobbies make men less masculine and therefore less attractive.	answer2: “Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short. wear shirts and boots because it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. Because you think that being a girl is degrading.”
What hobbies are you interested in and want to try, but are too nervous/hesitant/need convincing still?	answer1: I wanna start weight-lifting and training, or maybe take some sort of martial arts or self defense class. Basically, I want to be tougher but I don't know where to begin!	answer2: There are things I would like to do that I don't have the time or money to get into, but I can't think of ever being too *hesitant* to try a new hobby.
What was a cringe/awkward moment a Woman misinterpreted a situation but you where just being friendly or polite?	answer1: I was on a hike by myself yesterday and a cute girl and her dog were crossing paths with me. The puppers ran over to me and she introduced the dog. The dog was named 'gorda' which means fat girl in spanish. As i walking away i just yelled, bye bye gorda!! I cringed thinking that she may have thought i called the owner a fat chick but oh well. She's got to get used to it!	answer2: Seems like this question comes up about once a week now... Flagged a girl down on the road, pulled my bike up to her driver-side window, she rolled it down and said "I have a boyfriend" I said "that's nice, but you have a flat tire" Then I wheeled into the sunset.
If you could magically look into the future and see that you were never going to find love. What would you change about your life?	answer1: To be honest, I'm not sure I'd believe him. I mean, I'm engaged to the woman of my dreams now, so I'm speaking hypothetically. But even in my decades as a lonely virgin with nothing too special about myself and zero prospects, I always just believed everyone finds love eventually.	answer2: Would changing anything change that outcome? If not, then I'd probably stop actively looking for a relationship but that's about all I would change.
Have you ever asked a girl out even though you assumed she would say no?	answer1: Every single time. So if she says no I won't be disappointed and if she says yes I get a pleasant surprise. And it works. Does it increase my success rate? Sort of, I asked out more people so there is a chance they say yes compared to not asking and not having a chance at all.	answer2: I have unacceptable skin condition, so asking out is not an option. My action corresponding to your asking out is asking a woman to talk with me. I did that 120+ times in the last 4 and a half years and only this month I've succeeded for the first time. So there were more than hundred times when I assumed they'd refuse, often harshly and vulgarly, and all but one actually did. I guess this is irrelevant to you.
What was your last straw with a former friend, where you said I don't ever want to see this person again?	answer1: Friend of mine was murdered really horribly, I rang another friend in tears and absolutely destroyed, asked her to come spend the day with me. Her response was "oh I have physio... and work later... maybe saturday?(it was thursday)" I was speechless, and hung up with her - later got a message that she couldn't do Saturday as she was busy. Found out later she was at a party with her boyfriend.	answer2: Me: -Gets phone call- Friend: XXXXXX stole $200 from me. I know because I went to take a shower and when I went back to my room it was missing from my wallet. She's the only one home. I used to live with XXXXXX and stuff would go missing constantly. I had a hunch it was her and could never prove it. As soon as she got caught, I was done with her. 25 years of best friendship be damned.
at work, how do you ask someone nicely to do a task themselves (when they're trying to offload it on to you when they could and should do it themselves)?	answer1: This is something I had to learn how to do. They’re not asking for help because they’re struggling, they’re just being lazy. You just look at them sincerely and say “I’m sorry, I’m busy in my stuff right now. If you have questions because you’re struggling, I can do my best to answer them for you.” It’s not your job to do someone else’s stuff.	answer2: “You are the fucking worst” and then it’s a game of forget chicken and whoever remembers first has to do it. Not the most effective but it’s worked for 2 years
I just found out I'm pregnant. What was your experience with getting an abortion?	answer1: I haven't had an abortion but i'm not against it. I hope you make the right decision for yourself, whatever it may be. If you are taking the abortion, you are still pro life. You are pro YOUR life, which is equal to the clump of cells in your body. Now as selfish as it sounds, having children is selfish no matter what. Kids never ask to be born so to make a choice in this will always be a selfish one. You will get through this, talk to someone you trust and make sure you have at least 1 person to support you, maybe to discuss this with, someone that can be as neutral as possible and knows you and your life. Good luck!	answer2: Hey -- I've never had an abortion, but FYI I used to be an abortion counsellor at a feminist health clinic and abortion provider. Happy to answer any questions you may have regarding what I learned from my clients.
Whats the most ridiculous question you’ve seen asked on this subreddit?	answer1: The guy that basically asked if women have thoughts and are self aware Then when he rightfully got ripped a new one, he edited it to tell us we all just didn’t understand what he was asking	answer2: Any question where, by the rules of the sub or otherwise, there will only be one acceptable answer, and no other reply will be seen or engaged. Topics include, off the top of my head, abortion/ minority rights/ healthcare in the US/ anything about "do women like x,y,z"
What do you want out of a wife?	answer1: Someone who matches me in ambition, greed, drive for self improvement, and brutal honesty. Intelligence, desire for biological immortality, and the belief in improving/replacing body parts with tech is pretty necessary too. You know. A partner.	answer2: It sounds cliche, but communication, I've been married almost 20 years and the key for us has always been communication, IF something is bothering her, I want her to let me know, don't keep it bottled up until you explode, SAY something.
Ladies, what are you sick of seeing on dating profiles?	answer1: The one that always bugged me was 5 group photos, and then wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses in the only solo photo. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU ARE???	answer2: Exotic travel photos, anything materialistic, Camo, or pics with their kids in them. I wish you only got ONE photo for a profile. Get really tired of album overload.
What's something that you listen to your SO talk about but don't really care at all?	answer1: Almost everything. She's always spouting on about some trivial stuff about people at work or stuff in her game or a click bait article that she 'relates' to or how she looks after putting on make up or how she thinks she's fat when she could really use a few more pounds or does this shirt looks good with there jeans etc etc etc That thing about women having hundreds of internet explorer tabs open in their brain is no joke.	answer2: All the bitches she works with. "Every woman got a woman at work she hates. And it's always some Dynasty shit."------Chris Rock
Former AskMen smokers: How did you quit?	answer1: Switched to vaping 2 years ago. The day the vape arrived in the mail, I quit, and it was pretty easy. I still crave the ceremony around cigarettes - beating down and opening a fresh pack, the fresh tobacco smell that always reminded me of raisins, the lighter, that first puff. I miss cigs. But I've tried then since and can't handle the taste anymore. I remember it being so much better than it really is.	answer2: Third family member died of heart/lung disease. Didn't want to be the fourth. So I quit 'cold turkey'. I know this probably won't help you but that's just my experience.
Men of reddit, with report after report of diamonds being worthless. What do you think men will be proposing with other than diamond engagement rings?	answer1: There are a lot cooler gems colourwise I think getting one that is her favourite colour is a good idea	answer2: Strictly speaking, gold and silver are near-worthless, too, except for perception. You will find that most great things in life require a buy-in of one sort or another. If you want a long-term, committed relationship with an extraordinary woman, this is your buy-in. Let's be completely honest; in most cases she is getting the shorter end of the stick when it's all said and done, anyway. No pun intended...
What's a telltale signs that a male character is written by a woman and female character is written by a man?	answer1: As a guy, sorry if I'm not suppose to reply but I feel its relevant. I don't read much but listened to goldfinch and hunger games. It felt like the males we written by females because of the way they think so emotionally and with detail. Maybe its just my mind but i feel guys should be written more instinct or reason. It been a while since so take my opinion with a grain of salt.	answer2: An English teacher of mine pointed this one out. Men describe women using fruit (cherry lips, pear shaped hips, apples in cheeks, etc.) Once she pointed this out I cringe every time I read a fruit-based description of a woman.
What has changed since you went from "girlfriend" to "wife"?	answer1: Absolutely nothing. We got married in January for insurance purposes, had been together for nearly nine years, and had lived together for about six. Everything is the same, except that our relationship is just like everyone else's now. I always kind of preferred not being married. I felt like it was special to have such a strong relationship that the government didn't have their fingers in.	answer2: Other people seem to take our relationship more seriously and have more respect for it, whether it be friends/family or random people who may hit on either one of us. I've never met a guy who cared when I've told him I have a boyfriend but they tend to back off when I tell them I'm married. Plus, I know it's stupid, but I feel a little more special and confident in our relationship. I like being introduced as his wife rather than his girlfriend...oh and I also like being covered on his health insurance lol
FAQ Friday: Do you think you’re attractive/unattractive?	answer1: Please note that we already have our semi-annual pic share threads, so we are not letting this turn into a pic-posting, "pls validate me" post. Any posts with pictures of yourself will be removed.	answer2: Please note that we already have our semi-annual pic share threads, so we are not letting this turn into a pic-posting, "pls validate me" post. Any posts with pictures of yourself will be removed.
Guys, how do you handle a woman who wants you to slap/hit her during sex?	answer1: Probably ask a clarifying question "are you sure?" and proceed gently until she describes how hard. This isn't really my thing, but if she's into it, then I aim to please. Better to start off gently than to hit her too hard at the start I think.	answer2: I've done it, but I've found that it's more or less impossible for me to respect them or take them seriously afterwards.
Men. By around 30 do you think all the best women are off the market?	answer1: This sounds like a really shitty perspective to have. Implying that youth is the most valuable quality of a women? I mean, is like someone in their mid twenties an old hag? Because what the hell... single digit age gap is normal, usually not 9 years say but 6? I don't get this question.	answer2: Some people would say that if a person isn't married by age 30, there must be a reason behind it. I would say: there is probably a story behind it. Many things in the world are like this. No real reason why it's that way, but there is a story of how it came to be.
ladies, what's the first sign of pregnancy that you've had? ( the earliest one ) and how far along were you?	answer1: I'm a horse trainer, both my pregnancies the first sign was my horses/client horses all started acting weird around me like a week before my missed period. Sweetest ancient old pony suddenly lunging for my arm if I tried to touch him, huge asshole ex-bronc being super gentle and respectful, my partially blind mare who literally anyone can ride wouldn't let me touch her face, etc. In terms of my body, nausea and sore boobs around six weeks.	answer2: Missed my period. Took a test and found out I was pregnant. Less than 2 weeks...the embryo hadn't even implanted or whatever yet. So glad I found out right away.
From a guy's perspective, what would your thoughts be if you found out your friends GF had a crush on you?	answer1: 1. I'd lose quite a bit respect for her, and see her as a friendship-wrecking, manipulative beach, 2. I'd let my friend know what's going on, 3. *"In my opinion, I think crushes like that are almost inevitable."* No dear, they **ARE NOT**. For you, hanging around a friend of your guy means you need to be crush-y/flirty with him? WTF, man?! >What would your thoughts/reaction/opinion be if you found out a friend's girlfriend had a crush on you? I'd realize she was the type of person to sleep with her SO's best-friend if the r'ship ever goes south. And I hate beaches like that. **PS: Although my comment might have come off as sexist, but I'm an equal-opportunity hater in this regard. I deeply hate/resent the lazy/classless assholes/scumbags who 'crush over' their friends' gf's as well...**	answer2: Flattered, but I would redouble my efforts to be really cautious about being alone with them or anything like that. I know that I wouldn't do anything like that, but sometimes people like to draw conclusions, so I would avoid putting myself into a position where I could even possibly be seen as getting involved beyond just being a friend.
What is the hottest thing a woman has ever said to you while sexting?	answer1: I personally don't like sexting outside of pictures. The whole painting a scenario thing is just incredibly uninteresting to me unless I can actually do what we're talking about right then. Plus it's usually just meaningless words that never actually happen. My idea of sexting is a girl texting me and saying "Hey, do you want a blowjob tonight?" That would turn me on.	answer2: Funny thing is, its usually not during sexting. Usually were having a normal conversation and she will send "I really want to suck your cock tonight". The lack of context makes it seem to matter of fact, like sucking my cock is an item on her grocery list. Its surprising and sexy.
(NSFW) Do you prefer tits or ass? and why?	answer1: Ass with no tits beats tits with no ass every day In general perky B cups with a nice butt are perfff	answer2: I can't pick just one. For years I have been an ass man. Always dated women with smaller tits and a great ass. Then the switch flipped. My recent ex had smaller boobs and not much of an ass, but all of the sudden she went from a small B to DDD's in a matter of 6 months. I then became a tit guy for a while. I'm on the fence. Depends on the gal.
Ladies 20 and older, what are your experiences with teenagers trying to hit on you?	answer1: It's usually a really quick "hey, would you go out with me?" kinda thing where I'm pretty sure they're only partially serious, so I just smile, say no, and go on my way. One time, though, when I was drawing at a park, this 15 year old skateboarded up to me, started a conversation, then slid onto the bench next to me acting all suave. It was adorably hilarious, like watching a puppy learn to walk. When I realized he was not just making friendly conversation (I'm slow sometimes) I dropped my age, which he took in stride, so then I mentioned my husband. To which he said "aw, man, you're married? Well, it was nice to talk to you!" and skated off. Kid had game!	answer2: I am fat and apparently give off a kind of motherly/grandmotherly vibe in person (despite the fact that I'm not even in my thirties yet), so thankfully it doesn't happen in the real world. Every once in a while some kid will try to chat me up online, and when that happens I just laugh at them and then block them.
Wealthy single men, how do you date knowing there's a possibility the girl you're seeing may only be after you for your money and nothing else?	answer1: If I make considerably more than a girl, there’s no way it’s moving beyond casual fling/hookup. Also I generally don’t pay for a girls drinks or dinner on a date. That way I know she’s hanging around because she enjoys spending time with/fucking me.	answer2: My buddy makes six figures in his early 20s in the entertainment industry in LA. He has insane connections and women hanging all over him when they find out what he does. Whenever we go out together he tells people he works at Starbucks.
Men: How persistent are you in asking/pushing for sexual activities that your SO doesn't want to do? How many times would you ask your SO to do something before giving up?	answer1: I'm not persistent at all. It should be fun for both, not "I'll allow it so you shut up." because that's not as much fun.	answer2: Im overly persistent I need to work on it. And the same time sometimes when my girlfriend eventually does it she finds out she likes it. I need to be less persistent. She needs to be more open to trying things that she'll likely enjoy.
I keep hearing all those birth control horror stories. Does anyone actually have a good experience with going on the pill?	answer1: Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects. Sex drive is terrific, no depression (even though I'm a risk group), no weight gain. And while I believe each and everyone who suffered side effects from the pill, I also feel like it's just very trendy right now to condemn it. But for so many women it's the best form of contraception, otherwise there wouldn't be so many using it.	answer2: Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects. Sex drive is terrific, no depression (even though I'm a risk group), no weight gain. And while I believe each and everyone who suffered side effects from the pill, I also feel like it's just very trendy right now to condemn it. But for so many women it's the best form of contraception, otherwise there wouldn't be so many using it.
Did anyone have kids for the purpose of making their parents happy? If so, how do you feel about your decision?	answer1: I don't know if this totally fits but I just turned 31 and I'm 10 weeks pregnant. While I'm a professional my job doesn't pay very well and the father, a computer programmer, has been out of work for more time than I care to think about and already had 3 kids and issues with child support because of the laps in work. If it weren't for the support of my family who REALLY wants a grandchild and the support of my friends I'd be way more stressed out. It's not that I don't want kids but despite my age, on my own, I don't feel like I'm in a good place financially for this kid plus, on paper, the father doesn't sound very good, but my parents are more than ready to help me out so I'm gonna make it work.	answer2: I knew along time ago that I never wanted to have children. Now at 40, I know it was and still is the best decision for me. A few years ago I sat down with my Dad and explained my decision and what led me to make that choice and I told him he's an amazing father and grandfather. (He is a grandfather, he has 7 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren from my siblings.) he just wouldn't be getting one from me. He kissed me on the forehead and said, "You do what's right for you. I am surrounded by plenty of love already and I don't want you doing something so life changing just for me." I have a good Dad.
What's the line between nice and leading a guy on?	answer1: I'm attracted to pretty girls that are nice to me. I also tend to be friends with girls that are nice to me. So if you're my friend, you're pretty, and you're nice to me and you're available, chances are I will ask you out. You're not doing anything wrong. These things just happen. When I think "leading someone on," it's generally more of a conscious decision to pretend to like someone in order to get attention/benefits/etc. Those people who do that are awful, like you said.	answer2: In my opinion, if a guy likes a girl it's his responsibility to ask her out (similarly if a girl is into a guy it's in her best interest to make her feelings known directly). Up to that point it's not your responsibility to do anything. Once you're asked out you need to be direct and final in your answer, don't try to soften the blow at all, just let him know you aren't interested in a romantic relationship. Most guys will ask a girl out before they're head over heals into her and can accept rejection stoically. The people who don't are the squeaky wheels that you hear about all of the time, but honestly as long as you don't end the friendship or treat him/her like some creepy perv for showing an interest they won't hold it against you or suffer any sort of excessive emotional damage.
Farted while talking on the phone right before our first date. She started laughing. What do I do now?	answer1: Well, she did not hang up on you and reject further conversation, so that is good. Never mention it again and move on. Repeat: do not mention your gaseous habits.	answer2: Grow up. Once you get past 16 years-old check to see if you're mature enough to be in any kind of relationship.
How you feel when your SO "fishes for a compliment"?	answer1: Would not affect me personally but i would feel sorry for her being troubled by such thoughts. I'd give her the compliment she's fishing for and in the hours following that i may throw in a few extra gropes/pinches *(if i know she likes that ofc)* and let myself get "caught" checking out her body. With my ex-GF it would usually result in her smiling, giggling and getting turned on. Resulting in sexy time. Win-win.	answer2: My last relationship actually failed because i couldn't get on board with this annoying trait. In fact every time she'd fish for a compliment or any other answer via text I'd always send the fishing emoji back to her like a real jack ass. That and of course I'd "mansplain," as she liked to call it.
Bisexual men: are men better than women at hand and mouth stuff?	answer1: from my personal experience and from what i've heard from my female friends, men are just better performers than women in the sack. Women are nice when i want to hold something soft and nice smelling but ya'll are lazy (less movement in general) and weak (grip and endurance) compared to men. be thankful you got more squeaky toys strapped to your bodies.	answer2: Being women, they only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what? Thirty, forty-five minutes a week? And that's on a good week. How can they be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives?
What was that shit storm I witnessed on this sub yesterday?	answer1: Honestly, some people are going to enjoy things going to shit and cutting loose, some are not going to. For every person we had complaining about comic sans and the format yesterday, we had two or three sending us modmails and thanking us for loosening up and letting the sub get crazy. We're not going to make everyone happy, and its pointless to try. If you, or others, think it's dumb... well, it was ~24 hours of your life where Askmen didn't cater to you. And it was ~24 hours where we didn't moderate for content and got to have fun. I think everyone can deal. It's over and done with. And it is entirely predictable because this shit only happens once per year on the same day.	answer2: Honestly, some people are going to enjoy things going to shit and cutting loose, some are not going to.

Who else feels like he should work out more when seeing beautiful women?	answer1: Meh? Most of the kinds of women who'd set me to drooling don't notice anything that isn't on their cellphone screen. I could be buffed out like Schwarzenegger and they'd still be oblivious. I work out because I want to be healthy and have a better quality of life. Getting women isn't hindered by my looks so it's a non issue for the time being.	answer2: I actually get the feeling more often when I see fit men. Beautiful women actually make me self conscious to work out on account of boner through gym attire.
[Serious] What aspect of adulthood were you the least prepared for?	answer1: How much it costs. You don't realize just how much your parents were paying to support you until you have to keep one human being alive (aka yourself) with nothing but your own income.	answer2: **Your post has not been removed, this is just FYI.** AskMen does not moderate for the [Serious] tag like AskReddit. If you are concerned about your question not being taken seriously, you may want to consider removing it and rewording it. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Guys, I just got rejected and the girl said "You are literally everything I want in a guy but you aren't good looking enough" I know this is cliché af but how am I supposed to feel?	answer1: It's good, she was honest about it. You know where you stand and you can absolutely move on from her. Don't feel hurt. A lot of guys seem to think they will be attractive to the entire female population of the planet. But it's just not the case. So don't worry about it too much.	answer2: What a tactless cunt geez. That said everybody has different taste. Even you would prefer some girls over others. You have the right attitude.
How do you react to other women putting you down?	answer1: Remember that hurtful people are usually hurting a lot on the inside too. It doesn't excuse behaviour, but being nice in return can ameliorate the situation a lot more quickly and cleanly.	answer2: Also, a feigned look of pity and a gentle "I would be so embarrassed if I spoke to people the way you do." Bonus points if there are others around to hear it, as they'll always agree with you.
What's an innocent remark someone made towards you that you actually found very hurtful?	answer1: My sister was always the cool girl growing up. Pretty face and perfect body. I was the opposite of her. Anyway this happened on multiple occasions especially with distant family we had not seen for awhile. They would look at her and tell her "Oh wow you are so pretty" then look at both of us side by side and say "Man! You two don't even look like sisters!" Didnt tell anyone it hurt my feelings. I just laughed it off. Now I'd like to think I've blossomed into a decent looking person. Only took 30 years lol.	answer2: I had an ex boyfriend call me Aphrodite...I was like wow dude you can’t even use my name? Idc how good u think the sex is, don’t frickin refer to me as a cardboard sex icon from a dead society’s religion....(real talk tho I love mythology, just not when he used it to reduce me to a figure)
Ladies who are gamers: what's your favorite game and why?	answer1: I don't like the term "gamer" as an identifier for myself, but I play a lot of games. My favorite is Thomas Was Alone, probably. It's clever and tricky and simple yet infuriating.	answer2: I get so much crap for it, but legit Harvest Moon is my favorite game - or I guess up until A New Beginning & now it's Story of Seasons. People are like *it's just a farming game* but I like making money, taking care of cute animals, mining, fishing, establishing relationships. I think it's the nostalgia of it too, since I loved it as a kid.
Women who eat organic, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, keto, etc. What health benefits have you noticed and is it expensive to maintain that lifestyle?	answer1: I'm vegetarian and I went vegan/gluten-free/sugar-free/the-worst-diet-ever for about a month because I had an unknown allergy. Going vegetarian, I saved money and lost weight. Fast food is less often an option, even more so when you're vegan. You're also forced to be a bit more creative and learn more cooking. So, naturally, I eat healthier. I feel better, too. The biggest expense is fresh veggies and fruit. I buy frozen a lot, and buy whatever is in season and cheap for the rest. Eating out can be a challenge, but it's good for your wallet and waistline if you don't do it too often. You also get preached at a lot. People care about your health and diet.	answer2: My husband and I eat keto diets. We've had a lot of great results in terms of mental and physical health, including increased energy and decreased weight. It doesn't cost more than our old habits. We eat a lot of keto-friendly vegetables and fruit, meats, and cheeses. At first, I thought i was going to miss bread terribly, but it hasn't been bad and we make keto-approved bread when we really want something cake/bread-like. We both actually eat much healthier in general on keto than we did before. Dinner is usually a serving of meat, couple of servings of vegetables, and ice water. It works well for us.
Internet friends, what "uncomfortable realities" in your life have you become resigned to?	answer1: I will never have a normal relationship with my mother. I'm 25 and still afraid of "getting in trouble". I don't know how it keeps happening- I'll think I've figured it out and then she pulls me back in. Logically I know I'm an adult, and that her opinion no longer matters, but in the back of my mind all I want is for her to be happy with my life. I don't even care if I'm happy with it. As long as everyone else is satisfied, I feel like I'd feel okay. But I'm so constantly afraid of hurting or upsetting the people I love that it kills me when I mess up (which I always do) and I'm constantly terrified I'll wake up and have nobody left.	answer2: I'll never earn a livable income. I only have a GED and while I like my factory job, costs of living are going to increase faster than my pay. I could never in a million years afford to be on my own (thankfully I live with my boyfriend and we share bills), I'll never afford a house or anything. My nicest possession is my car, and even that I had to finance for 6 years. I really couldn't care less about college and I don't care to have a ~real job~ in an office or something, I just want to make enough money to live. But I don't and I never will.
What's the worst a woman has done to you on a date?	answer1: I'm a 5'5" guy and I went on a date with a 5'8" girl. The entire night she kept saying stuff like "Oh my god you are SO short!" and "Does it suck for you, trying to find girls at your height?" Yeah, that was a fast evening.	answer2: Was a feminist broke down what it means to be a woman in this day and age and how hard it was to be woman. Proclaimed that women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. I of course was elated at this news. When the waitress gave us the bill I handed her the bill and said women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. That is when she said she didn't bring any cash with her cause it was the first date and men should pay. Of course I raged on the inside and paid the bill.

What is your favorite tree and what do you love about it?	answer1: The Joshua trees found in the Mojave desert in southern California. They're an awkward mix between evergreens and cacti and I find them so fascinating - they only thrive in a certain region within the southwest US.	answer2: Cherry blossoms. They're gorgeous and when they are in full bloom nothing can top their beauty. But they only reveal themselves for a short window every year. They're exotic and mysterious.
How do people around you "get in their own way" socially without realising?	answer1: Hey, so I threw a blow-out-huge party only once for my 21st. I made the fb event weeks in advance, posted to the group like once a week w various promotional pictures, had called up a friend who lived in a PARTY HOUSE and he agreed to host, and when it came close I texted / messaged people personally to come on and get shwasted. It was fantastic! But it took a LOT of planning. I feel like I'm pretty well known but I wouldn't throw a party short notice for sure :( **EDIT: to answer your original question, I feel like I am one of those people who "get their way" and its all about speaking up. Also my friends think I'm funny**	answer2: I know a guy who's really nice, but he's just so *loud*. Slams his stuff on the desks/tables, watches videos on his iPod without headphones, sighs super loudly, etc. I like talking to him, but I also get annoyed whenever he enters the room because he sounds like a stampede of elephants.
How can I support my BIL through his divorce?	answer1: Offer to hang out with him regularly to help take his mind off things. Be patient with him. I'm sorry your sister did such a thing, and I ask you to inspire him so that he doesn't lose hope on life. Be a friend, be his hero, be his go-to-for support. If I were you personally I'd stick around long enough to make sure he ends up with someone who will treat him better, and make sure he's emotionally safe. Hope that helps. :)	answer2: "I'm sorry that I didn't tell you fifteen years ago that my sister's a backstabbing slut"? J/k... Sort of. But that revelation which she confided in you would be a big help to him during the divorce process. Infidelity is usually frowned on in divorce court. Of course, you would have to take his side, and betray your sister's trust; but considering that she's in the trust-betraying business herself, I wouldn't lose sleep over that.
For those of you who are middle class, how has Obama Care effected your ability to afford health care?	answer1: I am barely middle class, and I haven't been able to afford insurance or qualify for medicaid. I'm in the place where I'm too poor for one and too rich for the other.	answer2: From a non-American: Somebody please explain to me how Americans don't seem to understand that there is a significantly better way, IE regulating what medicine costs in the first place, leading to afforable socialized healthcare. Every other country in the developed world has social healthcare. You're standing alone in making health and well-being a fucking trade commodity. I'm currently battling cancer. I've had a surgery, two CT scans, maybe a dozen blood tests, countless appointments at the hospital, and I'm about to have a cycle of chemotherapy. At the end of it, I'll have paid $7 a day for it, and that's for the hospital parking lot. I don't have any health insurance, and I pay 12% income tax. *There is a better way.*
How many guys here didn't have a girlfriend until after high school?	answer1: Never kissed, fucked, or had a girlfriend until after graduating high school. I've always been a bit of a late bloomer	answer2: Twenty one here, I still haven't. There are lots of reasons, but chief among them is that I don't really put myself out there (and I'm not attractive enough to compensate for that).
What are signs on a date that a woman is using you for free food?	answer1: If you suggest coffee or a date and she counters with dinner. If you suggest a reasonably priced pizza place and she counters with something expensive. If you ask how she likes to handle to the bill on first dates after she suggests dinner and she wants you to pay.	answer2: Who is seriously that pressed for a free meal that they'd spend several hours talking with someone they have zero interest in? This really doesn't sound like a common problem that you should be worried about. Most women with normal jobs can pay for their own meal, unless they're hard up or homeless and haven't had steak in years.
What is your biggest "flaw" to your SO?	answer1: He says I'm a messy cleaner. For instance, I will vacuum the whole house, then leave the vacuum in the middle of the room I finished last. Or I'll clean the bathroom but leave all the bottles of cleaner on the counter. He says he can't *really* complain because I do most of the cleaning in our house but I know it drives him nuts. He usually just follows behind an hour later and tidies up after me.	answer2: That I refuse to eat tuna fish. He tries to get me to have a bite of his sandwich each time he makes a tuna melt. I keep saying *more for you* but no. It's a personal challenge to try to get me to not just try tuna, but to enjoy it also. Ewww.
Ladies of Reddit, regardless if you've actually had children, what are your favorite names that you'd use (have used) for your real/hypothetical children? Least favorite names?	answer1: I'm a teacher so my list of names I'd never give a child is super long - I've taught too many kids called Craig, Darren, Joshua, Dylan, Sean, Emily, Chelsea, Skye and so on who were absolutely poisonous little toe rags. So many names have been wrecked for me! A colleague had a baby recently and spent most of her pregnancy agonising over names that she liked and that didn't have terrible associations for her.	answer2: I HATE children, but I like the names Charlie and Olivia (after Olivia Dunham obviously). I could type out the names I hate, but I'm sick and it would be at least 100 names, and I'm sure someone would get offended by one of the names on the list.
What is your opinion of women who say they would leave their boyfriend if he doesn't propose within a certain amount of time?	answer1: I think they're idiotic. I think anyone who makes any major relationship decision around a time requirement is dumb and I would not date them. It raises what is probably the biggest red flag to me: She doesn't actually want to be with *me*, and just wants to be with *someone*. Also that she is incredibly driven by societal 'norms'.	answer2: I mean, if marriage is part of your long term plan, I get it. You don't waste time with people you're incompatible with in the long term. But I'd hope there'd be a discussion about your plans for the future and if and when marriage would be a thing, rather than an arbitrary deadline.
Men of Reddit, if you could choose, how would you prefer a girl you are friends with to approach coming out of the "friendzone"?	answer1: for the girl to be blunt and honest, it's the best way in my opinion, when people bounce around the subject it's easy to get confused so it's just a lot easier to be blunt and straight to the point.	answer2: She has to broach the subject first. First rule of friend-zone is the man never *escapes* from it, he is *released* by the warden. He doesn't get to decide whether to be in the friendzone or not. His only decision is yes/no if the woman decides so be something more.
If you could pick one question to be permanently banned to be asked on AskWomen - which one would it be and why?	answer1: Probably the questions where a guy asks about approaching women. Not because the question is bad but because the replies are always filled with rants detailing how all women absolutely despise being approached in public and how no men should ever dare do it because you’ll ruin a woman’s entire day by saying hi.	answer2: Women who are 23 what advice do you have for women who are 22? Do these people actually think someone who is 1-5 years older than them has that much more knowledge than them? You’re in the same age group.
Do any of you have no/little sense of smell? How does it affect your life?	answer1: I have almost no sense of smell and my roommate and I got into a huge fight last week because apparently my cat was peeing everywhere and I had no idea. My roommate is very quiet and didn't say anything until it got bad enough for her to move out. I rarely have guests and no one has ever said anything. I'm not sure how to clean this up without just hiring someone because I still cannot locate the source of the smell. I've never been more embarrassed. :(	answer2: I love spices and can smell strong scents and a few smaller things like raim, but general stuff I can't smell. I generally will ask my boyfriend to smell check things that aren't obviously molding. Esstienally if I really want to smell, I need to shove in my nose It sucks but I can't smell most shitty things either, like New York City or Boston.
Guys who left an SO for someone else, what was your experience like and was the grass greener?	answer1: I absolutely regretted it almost immediately and if I could go back in time I would not have made the same choice. TL;DR: Throughout High School I was massively obsessed with a girl. In college I met a girl who was better for me in every way and we started dating. The first girl got in contact with me and confessed that she's wanted to date me for the past year. I broke up with the second girl for the first. The first girl cheated and then broke up with me.	answer2: The grass was greener we had a great vibe and a positive personality. My past girlfriend I stayed longer than I should have because i was blinded by her beauty and the sex was amazing. She was a squirter need I say more
Where were you at the beginning of the decade, and where are you now?	answer1: At the beginning of the decade, I was a high school junior and turned 17 about two and a half weeks in. I am now a college graduate, with a BA in political science and currently in the process of applying for grad school online. I still live at home and don't have a job yet, but I'm OK with that. I don't want to spread myself any thinner than I have to at this moment in my life.	answer2: I was 10 living in my parent's house without a job Now I'm 20 living in my parent's house without a job
I woke up to my roommate standing in my room, he’s male. What do?	answer1: Start by asking him. If you don’t like what you hear, consider getting a lock on your door. That is pretty weird...	answer2: Second that sleeping beauty comment. Wear a man thong with elephant trunk. 🐘 Or he could be a gay vampire a la twilight Ed ogling sleeping Bella (you)
Stolen from ask men: What is a something about your partner that you are able to tolerate but you are sure the majority of others wouldn't?	answer1: He makes terrible jokes. We’re talking sitcom Dad level puns. Usually I find it cute, but occasionally I wish the ground would swallow me whole out of embarrassment.	answer2: My hubs has anger problems and is very aggressive. For the most part he is not abusive with me or our son but at times we had have fights. We haven’t had a fight in over a year. It’s less intense now that we are both heavily medicated. But during our first year together I contemplated leaving several times. Aside from his anger isssues, he’s the person I have had the most compatibility ever: from musical taste to sex. He’s also my second husband, btw.
It's October 1st! What are you being for Halloween this year and what is the best Halloween costume you've ever worn?	answer1: Nothing, and I've never been trick-or-treating. Its an american thing, right? So weird. We have a pedophile in our neighborhood, it would never work here.	answer2: I'm going to be Dr Strange. My wife makes amazing costumes. Scratch that. She and I will go naked, painted brown. We'll be chocolate bars, one with nuts, one without.
So I've been single for 8 years and sexless for over 10 years, it's having a huge effect on me mentally. How do you deal with this and stay confident/happy?	answer1: Focus on yourself and stop thinking about women and sex. Try to improve your life, your body or learn something you couldn't do before. Try something new that makes you proud of yourself. After a while you will become happy with your life which leads to confidence... and that's when a woman will come into your life naturally without even trying.	answer2: Thank you for posting this. I've been feeling very abandoned and alone lately for a same/similar situation, but I didn't know how to ask Reddit. This reading this post helps me feel a little less shitty from reading the comments. Thanks OP, thanks /r/AskMen
Is Bromance with Benefits a thing?	answer1: "benefits" in this context refers to sexual acts, and if both of the guys are straight then that's not gonna happen	answer2: Why do you have to associate closeness with 'how dicks looked'? I am closer than close than close with 2 good/great friends, and everything's up for grabs, except real sexual things. As in, real life sex-acts and anatomy between us. Rest everything about sex-acts and anatomy is okay, but ours and our families' sex-lives we generally don't talk about. And, we've not and don't want to see each other naked/etc. either: no. I hope noone of us shows each others our dicks; let's just say that.
Women who use dating sites, what determines if you reply to a message on a dating site?	answer1: The message they send me is a huge issue. If it is a "what's up" or "hey", they get deleted right away. That is not how you speak to a lady you are attempting to court. And it's just really annoying. Women get bombarded with messages, some are rude and distasteful (never ever respond), some are just hey (never respond). The one's I respond[ed] (no longer on dating sites) actually put something unique from their profile in their message, pointed to something in mine, and seemed genuine - not like they copied and pasted the same message to 80 women.	answer2: The things I would consider, in order, when deciding if I wanted to respond: * Do I think he's attractive? * Do I feel like he actually read my profile and is trying to start a conversation? * Can he compose a message with complete sentences and correct grammar? * Do the answers to his questions (I was on OkC) indicate any incompatibilities I'm not willing to compromise on? * Do I like his profile? Generally, though, everyone would get a reply, even if it was just "Thank you, but I'm not interested."
How can women compliment men?	answer1: If you preface every interaction with "I have a boyfriend", anything you say after that will be purely platonic. As for how I feel when receiving a compliment, it feels good, like the rest of the world is finally catching up to these great things I already know about myself.	answer2: Generally speaking men don't get complimented from strangers. You can almost say anything. Something about self worth is a good way to go. "Hey I like that jacket, fits you well, dude."
If your pet was the star of a Pixar movie, which famous actor would be playing its voice?	answer1: David Attenborough would be my cat's voice. He is an old man whose only joy is looking out of the window for hours at a time (briefly interrupted by morning meal, evening meal, and snack time). He would narrate the whole movie as he observed the intricate drama of the backyard squirrels and blue jays. At the end of the movie he would leave the window, shaking out his stiff joints, and discover that I was sitting on the part of the living room couch he considers "his." The camera would dolly in on his face as the audience absorbed the tragedy of old age.	answer2: Willen Dafoe, but with helium added so it's real high pitched voices Migde, and anxiety ridden 17-lb mutt. Special appearance by Ray Liotta, who will voice my baby/Midge's partner in crime. Midge would be trying to take over the world, but all attempts would fail as she continually would get distracted by crumbs and granola bar wrappers. Baby would continually get annoyed with Midge, only to laugh hysterically at her obsession for food. I imagine small vignettes of her failed adventures instead of one, feature-length film.
To those that have lived both in and out of the US, what cultural practices do you wish were more common in the states?	answer1: Things I wish on the US: politeness, the time taken to just be a tiny bit formal and make sure you say hello and how are you doing before you ask (ask, *not demand* - please and thank you!) for what you're after. The right of hospitality - like someone here mentioned for Scotland, this is common in most other countries: you're a visitor, you get a drink. Not offered, not wait to be asked, it's there and it's yours. Same goes for food. And finally, the right to just drop in on people, without having to call ahead and schedule something that fits into their timetables *and* yours and maybe just putting it off entirely because who wants the hassle? I didn't ever find something in US culture that I wanted to export to other countries.	answer2: I'll explain with a story: I spent a summer in Valencia, Spain. I went to a bar often with a handful of Americans. We were leaving the country and wanted to go to the bar on our last night. We get there and it's closing early so the owner can start his summer vacation. One hot-shot I was with was like, *keep it open and we'll buy double what you make in a single night.* The guy had money to burn. The bar owner looked at him like he was crazy. He basically said, *no amount of money will keep me from starting my vacation, you crazy American.*
Former thong wearers, what made you stop?	answer1: I do it for working out. Under workout clothes, of course. Oh, what made me stop? I should read questions before I answer because I am wearing one now. Dang.	answer2: I wore thongs exclusively before I had a baby. Then I got hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids and thongs do NOT mix, let's just leave it at that.
What are your thoughts on OkCupid switching from usernames to legal names only?	answer1: I used OkC to meet my now-husband years ago, and I use it now to meet new people (open relationship). No way I'll continue to use it. Too fucking dangerous. I'll stick to Tinder, thank you very much.	answer2: Sounds like a great way to get most women to stop using their website. We already have to deal with enough creeps when just using a username.
Would you ever consider adopting a child? Why? Why not?	answer1: I've been thinking more and more about it lately. I do want children but I just ... I can't easily explain it but I feel so weird about having another body inside my body. I don't think I can deal with the physical changes of pregnancy. To me it doesn't feel magical. I don't want my whole shit to change. I'm really private and get skin creepy-crawlies when someone touches my stomach. I don't think pregnancy would work for me. But I love kids. And I'd love to adopt. It's expensive and difficult though my company covers adoption costs.	answer2: Nope- you don't know what genetic issues and aggressions you're up against. Plus the only reason to have a kid is because my and my fiancée genes are so good that it would be cruel not to
What is the pettiest thing you've done to get back at/mildly inconvenience someone?	answer1: (Male, but sex isn't really relevant for this question, I think) I rarely get angry. I mean, the last time before this one was two years ago. Last week, a coworker said mean things to me (not about me, just *really* bad words). I didn't know how to react, since I just don't get angry. So instead, I 'punished' her for making me have to find a way to punish her. Didn't talk t her for a week. After that, I bought candies for her and shared with other employees.	answer2: I have two boxes of paper clips in my cube, the shiney newer ones and some grungy tetanus-y ones that came with my cube. When the CFO annoys or inconveniences me he gets his Monday morning reports with a tetanus clip.
what was the last compliment you received from a women that you don’t plan on removing from your mind anytime soon?	answer1: Why would I remove a compliment from my mind? Is that another way of saying "you won't forget"? I got complimented on my outfit by a couple coworkers today.	answer2: "You're a good dad." People (men and women) have said this to me before, but this woman specifically is a closer friend than they are and she had a really rough relationship with both of her parents. Just the way she said it made me feel less like she "was just saying it" and more that she was being honest. Times when I'm at my wit's end with my kid I remember that and it helps calm me down
What are some things about office culture you wish you had known about before starting your job?	answer1: I work in retail and honestly it’s not that bad. The thing is though, you have to be mentally prepared for ANYTHING. Mostly it’s just the oddly dressed person, or a weird or funny comment. One time I had these two young boys come in and after a few minutes of browsing the candy shelf, one of them turns to the other and with a completely straight face says: “You’re too lazy to be alive.” I felt that. You felt that. The world felt that.	answer2: Don't buy new clothes for a new job unless or until you see the office. I got new dress pants and a couple of button up shirts and my grandmother bought me a suit. Everybody in the office was wearing jeans.
Men, what kind of sexism do you experience, and what do you think should be done to combat it?	answer1: Why feminism and not egalitarianism? Feminism is specifically the advocacy of **women's** rights in regards to equality to men. Whereas egalitarianism is the belief that all people should be treated equally regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status etc. I'm not trying to be snarky but there is already a word for equality for everyone and it's not feminism.	answer2: One of the mods of /r/askmen wrote this up once. It's pretty much the Definitive Answer to your question, at least at an abstract level https://www.notehub.org/2015/1/8/not-all-is-great-in-the-world-of-men It tries very hard to address your first question while avoiding "what we should do". ---- EDIT: The credit belongs to /u/dakru. I just dug it up. He wrote it. Kudos to him!
How do I get guys to realize they’re attractive?	answer1: It appears that a lot of men’s self worth is tied to a woman sleeping with them. Do not listen to that advice.	answer2: "Talkin' ain't doin'." - Zoe Washburne And I don't use this quote to make an innuendo, but rather to point out that words alone often aren't enough to break through decades of male self-loathing. It takes time, effort, and attention.
What happens at university/college, in terms of eeting women?	answer1: Not sure what its like in the UK, but here in Germany we don't eat women at university. Or at least I'm not getting invited.	answer2: Heres what I did and it worked amazingly well. Before you start college, get in real good shape. You don't need to have massive muscles, but it should be real obvious you work out. Having low body fat is slightly more important, but you need both. that's all you need to do. If it works out for you as well as it did for me women will approach you and it requires zero effort. Also I did a lot of drugs back then cause I hated my life. But women thought it made me look badass, which, while untrue, seemed to help a bit. Anyway, good luck! Now go hit the gym
Ladies, what’s your experience with getting a bikini wax?	answer1: Your significant other should do it. Free of charge minus the wax and those canvas paper sheet things and that lotion stuff. I'm just saying if their usually down their anyway. Best to make sure their not a one trick pony put him to work.It's just one more choir. You wouldn't pay to have your trash taken out(literally or a light bulb changed? Then again it is the 21st century. Maybe the lady at the STD clinic will throw it in when you buy a panel test?	answer2: It hurts but not as much as you think it will. It's fairly awkward making small talk with a woman you've just met staring at your vagina. I totally grudge paying money for pain.
Women of r/AskMen: Why do you like hanging out here and what is you favorite thing about this forum?	answer1: > Why do you like hanging out here? I value learning about male perspectives on things. >What is your favorite thing about this forum? Men.	answer2: It's the substantially but still only relatively less uptight version of askwomen. You get a few who think abd act like cavemen here but still beats mods putting words in your mouth.
What are your thoughts on Puerto Rican statehood?	answer1: If Puerto Rico becomes a state, then they should add two additional states as well to get up to 53, a prime number. "One nation, indivisible..."	answer2: Once they have completed bankruptcy I would be happy for them to become the 51st state. They already get all the right and privileges for the most part so why not. Unfortunately the republican party will put a stop to it because they are afraid they will be a democratic state if admitted. (same for D.C)
What (subtle) sexist things do men do that they think is "normal" or are unaware of?	answer1: This post has been locked due to brigading, invalidation, and disrespectful commentary. If you have any questions, please message the moderators through the link on the sidebar.	answer2: This post has been locked due to brigading, invalidation, and disrespectful commentary.

How would you feel if a guy you liked slept with your friend?	answer1: What is my relationship with the guy? If he's just some guy from the other side of the office who I think is attractive then I'd be like... High five, hope you had fun. If it was a guy I was friendly/friends with who I was growing feelings for then I would be kind of jealous and sad. I mean, that wouldn't be my friend's fault though. I'd probably pretend to be fine with it. You don't get to claim ownership over someone just because you like them.	answer2: Would tell both of them to fuck off permanently. I have no time for people like that and their shit.
What would you think if your fiancée said she wanted to leave her engagement ring at home when she goes to a music festival without you?	answer1: I'd believe her. If she wanted to cheat, it's not like she can't just put it in her fucking pocket ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯	answer2: Ask her how would you feel if once married you say you’re going out to party for a night and said you’ll be leaving your wedding ring, see what their response would be because no doubt it’ll be different when the shoes on the other foot. It’s fishy to me and a big red flag however, there are alternatives to wedding and engagement rings look em up.
How many of you have gone to a party [where you don't really know anyone] alone?	answer1: I have been and it can be tough. It depends entirely on the people who are there if you are going to feel active. My advice, just get hammered and have fun, if you get off putting vibes or something then dip. Fuck em	answer2: I don't recommend it. Usually everyone just ends up staring at you trying to figure out how they know you.
Those who have or have had a low libido, what did you find that helped increase it?	answer1: Discovering cohabiting partnerships are my reason of anxiety and low libido. Discovering that monogamy was not for me. Discovering that I'm much happier with multiple partners and variety of sexual encounters.	answer2: Losing weight and cleaning up my diet. I think part of it was that I just didn't feel attractive. But also I was just tired all the time and bloated, and I really think a shitty diet can mess with your hormones. I focused on getting healthy (losing weight was just a by-product of that). I have so much more energy and confidence.
Does anyone else feel meh about giving blowjobs?	answer1: i think a lot of people exaggerate how much they like giving head just to seem cool or impress people, so i wouldn't feel bad if it's not something you get a lady boner over. i don't think that makes you prudish at all! i personally really enjoy it to a point, but i have the worst gag reflex so sometimes that kills it for me. but besides that it's something that really gets me going, especially surprise bjs. it also depends on the size. anything that's over maybe 7 and fairly thick is overwhelming to me	answer2: I do it because my husband loves it. I only enjoy it when he is moaning, being loud, etc. He used to hold back and be quiet, so it was really boring for me. But hearing him enojying it like nothing else. Is your partner overly silent when you do it? I know that for me, it hurts my jaw when I am in front of him, my face facing him(i guess typical pose?). It is infinitely more comfortable if i am facing his legs. 69 is a great position just because of this. I also love 69 because I get something out of it as well :) I normally can't finish through oral, but we are in that position he seems to hit more places, and i think me being on top tends to pull my insides in just the right place. You should try that!
What is it like moving to a completely new city alone?	answer1: Hey man! I just moved to Vienna alone. Expect your friends to act like they care but as soon as you are away they won't give a shit bout how you are doing. But after a long cry alone, you'll be fine. Gives you a lot of opportunities, and hey what else is life for? Sometimes you need to be alone to find yourself and do what you always wanna had done. Don't be afraid, be yourself! You have the bravery to make that move, that alone should tell you you are special. Go on and imagine all the good things that may happen. What would it help to stay where you are?	answer2: It sounds awesome at first because of the thrill of moving to a new city. Then it sucks for a while because you realize you don't have any close friends and the closest people you have are thousands of miles away. You cry and spend time alone in your apartment. You realize you can't do this forever. It slowly starts to get better as you start making new friends and putting yourself out there in the new city. TL;DR: It's awesome at first. Then it sucks for a while. It gets better though. Source: moved from San Francisco to Chicago.
Women of Reddit how do you get rid of guys who don't take ' No' as an answer?	answer1: I get really, really gross. One dude at a bar didn't take no for an answer. I was drunk so when he said, "I got a pocket full of condoms." I blurted back, "And I've got a pussy full of blood." He actually physically retched and walked away while I cackled.	answer2: If you say “No” and the person won’t accept it, it is not your business to make them happy. Walk away. The reason people refuse to accept No for an answer, is because that want you to change your No into Maybe, and finally a Yes. The problem is, your initial/right/true/intuitive response was No, and they failed to respect it. The problem lies with them, not with you. Those who know no boundaries, no honor, no respect are really good at letting a No fly over their head, and continue to insist to get their way. Psychos are especially skilled at that. Just ask any victim of violence. And that’s why it’s not your responsibility nor obligation to deal with such people. There are a lot of respectful people in the world who’d enjoy your company and be honored by your presence.
Women with autism: what are social issues you deal with that you're not sure men with autism have to deal with?	answer1: I'm not treated harshly at all since most people can't tell that I have it. Most just think I'm slightly strange. Since the pressure to be social is ingrained from birth for women, in general, women with autism (at least higher functioning ones) get really good at mimicking proper social behavior by the time we are adults.	answer2: 1. people telling me to smile all the damn time. i don't hear anybody telling stony-faced men to smile. 2. expecting me to be naturally comfortable with and desirous of holding babies thrust into my arms with no warning and to know what i'm supposed to do with them until i can give them back. again, i never see this with male relatives, nobody expects them to be interested in babies. 3. being helpfully told how i could be prettier when i didn't ask and did not previously feel self conscious! thanks >:/
How much watermelon is an appropriate amount to eat in 36 hours?	answer1: As much as you physically can. When it starts to make you gag, have one more bite and wait an hour. Then repeat.	answer2: You should eat something else. Too much of anything isn't good. Although watermelon is "healthy" and contains a lot of water it still has a lot of sugar. It's all about balancing your diet. I'd go with another snack.
Married men of Reddit, what are some things that you are glad you don’t have to deal with from your wife/husband that others seem to have to?	answer1: I'm really glad I'm not dealing with a dead bedroom after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids like so many guys seem to be.	answer2: I'm glad my husband doesn't have an issue with me being very close friends with other men and hanging out with them one-on-one. I'm friendly and attractive, so I make friends easily. I couldn't have a husband who was controlling in that way, but I see some of my peers dealing with this with their SO's and it's a nightmare, imo.
Sugar daddies, approximately how much money do you give for what in return?	answer1: 7k to 10k base/month for the good looking ones. There's a subreddit for this stuff. I read it if I want to feel sad.	answer2: I've been offered to be a sugar baby basically, and I lol'd. I had no idea what the set-up was supposed to be (I never did it) until I told people later. I value my time too much to everrrrr get involved in this shit. I do know this one girl I used to work with who does this though. She's my age (26), and hangs out with some 42 year old (who looks surprisingly young, I might add). She gets to go to courtside games with him, gets fancy dinners, he buys her designer shit, etc. She claims they don't sleep together, but she is probablyyyyyyy lying. I don't know - she says he just wants someone to talk to her, to accompany him, etc. I don't know if I buy it but it's not my place to judge.
What is your most problem part of your body when it comes to fitting into clothes?	answer1: I’m too small for western sized clothes. Sometimes XS is too big… Edit: I live in Sweden. Shoes and clothes my size are considered children-sized. My clothing style (modern goth) only have sizes for “somewhat obese” people in the stores here and it’s so frustrating!	answer2: Most skinny jeans are too tight for my calves. If I buy a bigger size then it’s too big for my waist and thighs. I’m pretty short so wearing flared jeans make me feel even shorter so prefer skinny jeans.
If most gay male porn were made for women (like most lesbian porn are made for men), what do you think gay porn would be like?	answer1: See [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net) or [https://archiveofourown.org/](https://archiveofourown.org/) that is what a lot of it would look like. To spare you the time: more story, more foreplay, more "love" (cuddling etc.), more eye contact. However, the tastes vary greatly as you can also see when you look at the stories from the provided links.	answer2: Well, what's there to change? Porn is quite literally just for sex so I don't think gay porn would change if it was made for women + how women have different interests, some like cuddling and others just like the sex... So ya, I don't really think much would change or even could change Note: I don't watch porn, I don't get off my watching people have sex but I personally like erm.. Rough sex... So if I did watch porn I wouldn't want to see much cuddling.
For those of us that never really had nice things, how did you get rid of that feeling of “waiting for the other shoe to drop” when you actually had something nice?	answer1: It was a slow, gradual process. When I was a kid I ate gubba'mint cheese and powdered milk. Mom made almost no money (and I think she was bad at personal finance). It took years, some ups and downs, but I got to the point where I realized I saved up for vacations and purchases ahead of time. I have six different whoops/emergency funds. I am going to pay my house off early. I made a great salary. Now and then I'll still find myself doing poor people stuff, tho. Cobbling a ghetto dinner together out of random shit in the fridge because I've mentally calculated the price per meal ... or refusing to buy coffee at home because it's free at work, etc.	answer2: The thing is the other shoe is always going to drop. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. You need to just take the moment to appreciate things while they're good and not worry about the things that are bad until they happen. Some planning for misfortune is a good thing, but always worrying about it is not. Nothing stays perfect forever. Trying to exercise control over everything never actually works. Just try to appreciate it when things work out because it's temporary. The problems will show up on their own concentrate your efforts on making the good things happen.
How do I confront my roommate about his girlfriend being over too much?	answer1: Wait, I'm a little bit confused. Is she an economic drain on you/the household? Like is she monopolizing the living room couch, eating all of the food or anything else but hanging out in your roommates space? Because if it's just a matter of you not liking her there, this is a situation I'd advise to "suck it up." I get that it's frustrating that your roommate isn't listening to you, but (and maybe I just suck at reading) it almost sounds like jealousy on your part.	answer2: I had a friend who went through almost this exact scenario. Except it was her, two male room-mates, and one of their girlfriends. And when she complained that the girlfriend was there all the time and not contributing to the rent or anything they got really petty and started being dicks to her. She ended up going to the landlord, because the place was in her name, and basically demanding he do something about it. She basically was saying "this is violating my lease agreement" (they usually have rules about how often guests can stay), and that they could either stop the girlfriend from being there so often, or let her out of her lease agreement. It isn't the best solution, but if you a roommate who isn't showing you any respect, sometimes being hostile is the way to go.
So my [29F] girlfriend's doctor refuses to install permanent birth control on her, but has no problem suggesting that I [29M] should get a vasectomy instead. Thoughts?	answer1: I think it is absolute bullshit. When my doctor recommended my SO get a vasectomy instead of me getting sterilized, I told her that wouldn't protect me because we're non-monogamous. Her solution? "You should be monogamous." End of discussion. Uhg.	answer2: Oh, for fuck's sake, just get the vasectomy. It's usually way less invasive than any female equivalent and you won't have to look around for 10 years just to find a doctor willing to sterilise a woman.
What was your biggest "It's not what it looks like" moment?	answer1: Well I'll answer this but it's nothing to do with sexy time. In college there was a massive pond near by with all sorts of waterfowl and I used to joke around with my foreign housemate about how delicious they looked, which horrified my poor housemate. Now our flat was on the ground floor and one day, having left the window wide open, I walked into the kitchen to find a very confused and unhappy duck. I'm pretty used to handling animals but this duck gave me a bit of a runaround. I finally managed to get the duck in a safe handling position so it couldn't flap when my housemate walked in. Picture: me, standing by the oven, holding a distressed duck. "PM_ME_FLUFFY_BUTTS WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT THAT DUCK DOWN!"	answer2: Sharing a bed with an engaged friend while we spooned and watched Disney movies. I know that to outsiders it looks like an excuse, but he really was just that good a friend.
What's that one super embarrassing thing you did that keeps you up at 1am cringing about it years later?	answer1: I was a new boss and had to fire an employee for the first time. She packed her bag, cleaned out her desk and I followed her to the door. And I said ... "See you later". It was just a habit. The way she looked at me ... I still cringe so hard thinking about it.	answer2: I won best dressed at prom.. I said thank you all for voting for me because I was so shocked that my class did that and I was very unpopular then and spoke to no one and the "late chick" during my school days. Edit: I would like to make it clear that I was an awkward teenager and didn't expect this and didn't know what to say and I had said it as though I'm the prettiest girl in the world because I do not know what to say at that moment. I still cringe at this moment.
Men who have been baby trapped by women how do you handle the situation?	answer1: Trapped meaning you are half responsible for the creation of a person and now have to co parent or financially support the dude?	answer2: When I busted my ex cheating (again), and broke up with her, I saw this desperation in her eyes, and they darted around the room as she thought for a solution. Suddenly she looked up at me and said, "Let's get married, let's have a baby" with a look on her face as if she had solved the problem of me getting rid of her. When she said that, an image of me in a cage popped into my head. I didn't think about it, it popped in as soon as she said it. Conversation was over, I told her to leave.
Men who love their jobs, what do you do?	answer1: I take care of people with disabilities. Love it. The people i watch over really enjoy having me around since we are all around the same age (21). Most aren't verbal but we still have conversations. Even one of the guys who is very aggressive toeards staff hasnt tried to hit me yet. I dont even say i work. I just hang out with friends and get paid for it.	answer2: I don't love my job, and many people don't; I don't think you need to "love" your job in order to be happy, though it's definitely ideal. You sure won't get any better sense of what you want to do by asking strangers on the internet. Are you thinking about a career change? If so, find a field that interests you and try to run with it. Either way, if your current situation isn't working out, take the necessary steps. Or move to another city, whatever. Sorry I might be a bit drunk but you get my point.
Anyone get married for reasons other than love? How did it turn out?	answer1: I got married because I wanted to run away from my family and my home country. He was older and knew why I was doing it and he was fine with it. I liked him a lot, but love didn't have much to do with our marriage.	answer2: My ex is getting married to the girl he started dating a week after me and has only been with for 10 months. I think he just really wants to be married- and anyone who fits the basic qualifications will do.
What female name is an instant turnon for you?	answer1: I'm secretly hoping all the women who see this headline are in here just to ctrl+f their names and I'm not the only one because that would make me feel weird. Like caring what Disney Princess I am on the latest facebook quiz.	answer2: Why do you have to say female? Christ guys can like dudes too and shouldn't be purposefully excluded from every other thread. Ya know what fuck it. Cody.
Is it rude to presume a gift will be given at a Renewal of Vows, and to specifically ask for cash because you "have it all"?	answer1: I'll repost my answer... I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People have birthdays every year and other still tend to buy them presents... So I don't think expecting that some people would give "second wedding" gifts.	answer2: Yes. Super presumptuous. I would not in a million years bring a gift to a vow renewal, and the assumption of getting one would be insane to me. I can see certain guests bringing them because hey, event, let's be nice to our friends, but.. to assume that everyone's gonna bring one and hey actually guys, just money will do? That is some *craziness*.
We've seen a lot of 'bad women's anatomy' what are some examples of bad men's anatomy?	answer1: Blue balls (aka Epididymal Hypertension) is a real thing that many men (including myself) experience. Just keep that in mind if you choose to escalate sexual activity but don't want to go all the way. Yes jacking off helps but doesn't relieve the pain immediately and very rarely is that option readily available.	answer2: My ex thought guys nutted on demand and that the vast majority of her ex'es were just shitty dudes that didn't want to give her more dick. I got some gems from that one 'I tell you hwhat.
Women not taking husbands' last name after marriage?	answer1: It's 2015. A lot of women keep their own last name. A lot of women take their husband's. And a lot of women hyphenate. Unfortunately, no matter what the woman does she's going to receive criticism from self-proclaimed traditionalists, from self-proclaimed feminists, from family, from friends, from people who have no right to be invested in it. What I'm saying is: it sucks, be prepared for it. As it happens, my wife did take my name, which was my preference. However, it's not a strong preference. If she had wanted to keep her own name, I would have been disappointed, but she's an adult, she gets to decide what to call herself.	answer2: I wouldn't marry a women who wouldn't take my last name. Not that it would be a problem though because the type of women to be against taking my last name wouldn't be the type of women id want to marry.
How do you deal with long hair without going bonkers?	answer1: I don't. I just chopped it into a layered bob again from almost waist length. I used to have a pixie, that was fun and easy to take care of. The balls of hair I would find in my laundry drove me nuts. The shedding everywhere, the constant need for brushing, always losing my hair ties, the stupid amount of product and conditioner, the ridiculous amount of time it took to wash, the fact that I somehow lost the ability to do Dutch braids, the feel of it against my neck - all of it made me crazy.	answer2: Yes! Same question! I once had a pixie cut and once I grew it long again I could no longer eat with my hair down. I absolutely have to tie it up or it annoys me to no end
Guys who ended up getting your dream girl, how did it turn out?	answer1: Married after two years, 7 year old kid together, we were extremely happy with each other and in love, at least I thought so. Then we got divorced and her and my daughter moved to another state with her new boyfriend. I realized the whole institution of marriage in the 21st century is stupid for guys. Most of them end up hurt, broke, and alone. I definitely made the best out of a bad situation, but still wish I would have never gotten married.	answer2: please dont put your 7 years of expectations on to her, you'll only ruin things. Just keep being you and don't worry about your status with her. I repeat, all you need to do is not ruin it! I say this because I lost my dream girl by trying to "lock it down" instead of just being the guy she was attracted to. There is no such thing as a love contract.
What's the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to you?	answer1: When I was 13, it was a thing to have your phone number in your status on MSN. I didn't have any friends but as a 13 year old, I was trying to fit in, so I put mine in my status. One girl's display name had a bunch of different people's names in it, indicating that she was having a party. I got a message from them saying, "omg LOL who the fuck would want to call you???? :D:D:D". I started crying and just said "i don't know" and removed it from my status. It was hurtful because it was true, I had no friends, and no one who would want to call me. Someone pointing it out was humiliating. The girl was a bridesmaid at a wedding I attended last year and it stirred up a lot of bad emotions.	answer2: Years ago I dated this guy who was incapable of expressing affection or initiating sex or looking me in the eye and thought that buying me expensive gifts and insisting on paying for everything would compensate for that. Years later his best friend, who I *thought* was also my friend, called me a gold digger. Repeatedly. The real kicker was that there was a time when I had all the intention, drive and motivation in the world to go out and get the six figure salary necessary to support my ex's lofty creative delusions. Kind of embarrassing for me to admit now, really.
Were you ever unknowingly the "other woman"??	answer1: Yup, a guy I had a strictly physical relationship with. First he was going through a complicated divorce. Then it came out that he lived in a spare bedroom in the basement. Uh huh. Found his wife's blog - she thought they were happy.	answer2: I was knowingly the other woman and fuck man... I get a lot of flack for it but people just dont understand the emotional turmoil being the other woman can be too...you fall for someone and it's always "I'm gonna break up with her" "I don't love her you are my only love" and constant heartbreak after heartbreak. I feel total guilt for the pain I probably caused but she was in another country and to me, SHE was the other woman!
Dear men, what’s the difference between the non-verbal downwards head nod and the upwards one?	answer1: I nod quickly down and back up to signal everythings okay, like when turning water on to a new sink, it means no leaks, its good. If i nod up it means fuck waters going everywhere and its usually occomoanied by a random short vocalization of frustration	answer2: Upwards: What's up man? How you doing? Acknowledgement of our knowing each other. Invitation to start talking. Downward: Acknowledgment of respect, agreement, understanding and/or wariness of each other or the situation at hand. EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards, I appreciate them greatly. And I'm glad we apparently have a near-universal form of communication.
Has your boss ever told you to wear makeup?	answer1: Nope and I very rarely wear any to work (only if for a big meeting/interview where I'm dressed up in a suit instead of my usual business casual.) If anyone ever told me to wear makeup, I would be very upset. Unless wearing makeup becomes the norm for both genders and is thus expected of everyone at my place of work, it is unfair to focus on women as needing to take the extra time out of their day to put on makeup to conform to a societal sense of beauty.	answer2: I don't know. Work performance isn't the only thing that matters in a professional environment. Dressing and looking professional are also a part of the job. A bare face isn't necessarily unprofessional, but if you put two women next to each other dressed the exact same way, the one wearing makeup would look more professional.
What do you think is the biggest lie that men tell themselves?	answer1: "I'm fine, I don't need help," for anything in their head Or "This is normal, I don't need a doctor," for physical health issues	answer2: That getting married is a good idea. It's not - cohabitating with a woman is a very bad deal for men emotionally and financially. You will lose half of everything you own and will be limited access to your own children while your ex tries to turn them against you. Look around at all the men you know and you'll see how common that is.

Women , what do enjoy the most about having your own place ?	answer1: Not having to deal with shitty roommates. I won't ever live with someone again unless I get married or have a kid.	answer2: I love living alone. Everything in my home is something I've chosen, I'm surrounded by things I love. I never have to pick up after someone else. I can always find what I need. When it comes to my home I get to make all the decisions, if I have an ugly recliner in the corner of my living room it's because I want it there. It sounds somewhat selfish, but every other area of my life requires a lot of compromises to work. At home I can do whatever I want.
What "superstition" do you believe in?	answer1: Celebrating something before it’s a done deal. It came from my younger days when I would do online dating. I’d talk to people through the websites and text with them but as soon as I saved their number under their name or even a description in my phone, they would ghost me. My fiancé and I are currently under contract to purchase a house and everyone keeps congratulating us. But until I’ve got the keys in my hand and my stuff in the new house, I am not celebrating shit.	answer2: Me and my sister are synced with the moon so we do which craft under the full moon. We know it won’t work but it’s still fun.
What is the correct response when a 9 year old girl says she is "trying to lose weight"?	answer1: A 9 year old girl who weighs 105 lbs (47.6 kg) is definitely overweight and definitely needs to lose weight. It's good that she is conscious of that. However, if I were her parent, I would do my best to do that without making her feeling ugly or affect her self-worth. If she tells you that again, say something along the lines of "well, you should make sure to eat plenty of fruit and veggies then" or "drink less soda and more water". Give her nutrition advice instead.	answer2: If it's someone else's kid? "It's always a good idea to try to be healthy. I'm trying to be healthy too. What kind of healthy food do you like to eat?"
Guys, when did you realise that the time has come to propose?	answer1: Beware. You say she says one thing then proceeds to do the opposite. Example, doesn't want to move fast... bang, your living together... say she doesn't want to move fast... when are you going to make one of the most important decisions of your life, quick, quick propose. Have you met the parents? What's the hurry? If you continue to see divergence between spoken and action it may be the character of the individual. Things have a tendency to magnify and be more evident over time. Worst case scenario: promises to love and honor then... 7 years in you are replaced but still paying the mortgage... no longer loving and no honor. Been there, done that. Best wishes.	answer2: My SO was moving into my place and having a hard time with her flat mate. She finally snapped at her “Sara, it’s been great living with you for three years, but I want to spend my *whole life* with X, so this *is* happening” When I heard that later I was hit in the feels massively and I realised I felt the same. Proposed the next day.
How do you guys deal with thoughts about missed opportunities?	answer1: Everyone handles it differently. For me I'll still get a pang if regret whenever my mind wanders over trivial crap that happened 15 years ago. In the end you just have to learn from it. Do better next time and deal with the emotions of regret it guilt as it comes to you.	answer2: That stuff happens when I'm on long drives and for some reason my mind wanders. Not sure why. As far as dealing with it, the past is the past. It's not like it's the end of the world you missed an opportunity with a girl, you're in high school. You'll have wayyy more chances with wayyy more girls. And if you see this girl at school just walk up and apologize for being an idiot, and ask her to see a movie or something.
Why did she fall out of love with you?	answer1: I was too beta. Poor frame, didn't lift heavy enough, too chubby and short, severe oneitis, and mistakenly believed I could turn a ho into a housewife.	answer2: It's less that she fell out of love with me, and more that while I was gone for work, someone else was around, and she fell in love with him.
If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?	answer1: I wish I wouldn't have grown up in the church. Looking back, I realize how brainwashed I was by their morals and ideas. I fell victim to a lot of bullying for it. I was sexually assaulted by members of the church. It was just a bad thing for me. Now, my parents don't even go. Edit: Fuck you to whoever downvoted this.	answer2: I would have liked not to be raised in a bubble by helicopter parents. My mom has recently apologized for making me think that everything is "scary" as a kid. Couldn't ride bike alone, go to the park alone, go to sleepovers, etc. I was a very lonely, anxious child.
What are you jealous of in other women?	answer1: Mod note: Locked due to rampant rule-breaking. Thank you to those who participated within the rules. Please continue to report all rule-breaking.	answer2: Mod note: Locked due to rampant rule-breaking. Thank you to those who participated within the rules. Please continue to report all rule-breaking.
What is your biggest, unconventional fear?	answer1: The human mind can not comprehend the aspect of “infinity” or “eternal life”. It’s a limitation of mankind. Because everything in the universe that we know of had a beginning and has/will have an end	answer2: That I get one of those anaesthetics that make you high for some surgery or whatnot. And my parents and friends sit in my hospital room and laugh at the funny things I say in my delirium and then I say something inexcusable, but everyone thinks that's my real secret opinion, because "drunks and kids tell the truth", and I won't even find out, because obviously nobody wants to talk about it...
How much attention should you expect from your girlfriend in a group setting?	answer1: I hate this too OP. There's a quote from downtown abbey I'll botch but it goes like "I know I'm not the most impressive man but I want to marry a women who thinks I am." Be with someone who is crazy about you. Not someone who is willing to be with you but lukewarm when it gets down to it.	answer2: Talk to her. I personally am ok with her giving me the least attention because I get a ton of attention from her anyways and it's nice to know she has friends besides me.
Men who are engaged or married, what was the moment that made you realize: I want to make this woman my wife?	answer1: When I was dying, before I knew I was going to recover, my now wife worked 3 jobs, but still managed to spend 5-6 hours a day with me, even if it meant she was passed out on the uncomfortable hospital chairs to be near me. She spent so much time there that the nurses grabbed a convertible chair/bed for her so she could at least have some kind of sleep.	answer2: play video game with me even though she isn't very good, takes and interest in my hobbies that she's isn't to interested in and I do the same for her. Edit plus she is pretty tight ;)
So guys forget about all the bullshit, what is some dating advice you personally have felt is important?	answer1: When you pull up to go knock on her door to take her out, you lock all the doors on the car. Then you walk her to the car, use your key to unlock her door for her, open it for her, and close it for her. Then you walk around the back to get in and you watch to see if she leans across to unlock the door for you. If she doesn't, you dump her and dump her fast. This is the point where she's being on her best behavior, being the most considerate she may ever be and its only downhill from there. If she's not willing to do this small thing for you, she's no good. My wife passed the door test, and we're solid. Just saying.	answer2: Figure out the difference between a bad occasion and a bad situation. Not every relationship is worth sticking around for, but not every negative is worth ending things over either.
For those of you that love the fall, how do you make October feel extra special?	answer1: I like to go on drives out to the country to see the leaves changing colors. My parents started the tradition when I was small after they realized how much I loved fall, and it's always something that will be special to me. I also like going apple picking and to pumpkin patches.	answer2: I’m in the southern hemisphere, so I’m sitting here happily not wearing 3 layers of clothes and enjoying the sun!
Aside from the gates of Hell opening, how does your period affect you?	answer1: It seems that about two or three days into my period, I start feeling really really really sick, way worse than any stomach bug I've ever had. I have no idea why this happens. It started happening very suddenly a bit over a year ago. Birth control is the only thing that keeps it at bay.	answer2: I get RIDICULOUSLY horny the day before/of and will do literally nothing but masturbate all day between bathroom breaks and if food is brought to me in bed. During the three days I have it I maintain a bit of that horniness to a lesser degree and have mild cramps. I also experience emotions 2fold which I find annoying.
Women who were, or whose parents forced you to be, part of the purity movement, how has it affected you today?	answer1: Wasn't part of any "purity movement" or anything but definitely raised with a sexual morality of self-respect and an emphasis on commitment. My sexual relationships have been meaningful and long lasting. I have never had any STDs or abortions unlike some friends of mine. I have friends who's parents really didn't care what they did and some of them have had over 30 sex partners, abortions, contracted herpes and been pumped and dumped which made them feel like shit. All in all I think I've had a much better outcome than they have.	answer2: I was pushed into it by both my (public) school and my church, but my parents weren't 100% committed to it and didn't push it. They weren't even aware of what the school was doing. I basically paid lip service to the trend as needed to avoid being singled out, ostracized, or bullied, but never bought it, thanks in large part to having internet access during my teen years.
Dudes with long hair, how did you survive the awkward in-between stages?	answer1: if you have long straight hair, pony tail works, not that man bun shit. I myself have long, curly hair and it just does it's own thing and I stopped giving a shit about looking like a retard awhile ago. When I'm working outside I usually just wear a hat to keep it out of my eyes. Sorry about your dad OP. If someone gives you shit about your hair looking stupid just say "yeah well i'm growing it out so i can donate it to cancer patients for wigs" and they will shut up.	answer2: Well, I was fifteen years old and played World of Warcraft at the time, so I was oblivious of the real world for the worst of it.
[Possibly NSFW] Men, who is the creepiest guy you know? What makes him creepy?	answer1: For most guys I've heard called "Creepy" I would advise them to dress better and lose some weight, as it seems creepiness and attractiveness are inversely proportional.	answer2: I know a guy who graduated from HS last year who was 19. He would hang around underclassmen, especially those that owned a 3DS. Once he knew that you owned one he would latch onto you. Even if you didnt know him. He also would laugh at everything, not a haha type of thing. But a HEAHEAUGHA. He made any situation feel uncomfortable.
Aside from feminine goods, what supplies would make a good care package for homeless women?	answer1: Socks! Socks socks socks Deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste. I just know most shelters say they are in desperate need of socks and no one ever donates them	answer2: If you take away all the feminine goods, then there's no need to differentiate between male and female homeless. In other words, socks.
Women who have done, or are doing nude modeling, stripping, camshows, porn, prostitution, etc. (jobs primarily aimed at pleasing men sensually/sexually), how has your view of men changed from before you started this work, to now?	answer1: I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting!	answer2: I've worked as a stripper since I was 17, and yes after a while it starts to distort your view of men a little bit. You get so used to seeing men at their worst. The majority of men who come to strip clubs are in relationships or married, and they always try to get something "extra" out of the lap dances, so sometimes I have a hard time believing that men are capable of being faithful. It makes me nervous to get involved romantically with any guy. I try not to let it affect me but its hard after a while. So many of my coworkers are jaded and hate their customers, especially the ones in their 30s who have been doing it their entire adult life.

What is your go-to Chess opening?	answer1: Stare down your opponent, get in their heads, be sure to smell bad to throw off their game, use a slightly crooked board to mess up their rhythm, have a mosquito sound playing in the background to subconsciously annoy them over time. Psychological warfare is the name of the game	answer2: I like to start out with a fat bongrip. After that I just stare down my mate until he reminds me I could start because I'm white and just go with the flow from there.
I'm about to give my 12 year old brother the sex talk. What do you wish you'd been told at that age?	answer1: Honestly, I feel like the talk should come from another male but if you're gonna go for it, go for it. He may already know a thing or two. When I was 12 I knew what sex was and that I needed condoms for it, I didn't exactly know the motions, or what a vagina actually looked like, I just knew sex was sticking my dick one. My friends all talked about getting "the talk" from their dads so instead of waiting I asked my old man. He said "Well, what do you not already know?" The only new thing he told me was not to let her parents catch you, they can try to get you charged with statutory rape.	answer2: * Practice with a condom by yourself long before you try and do it with a girl in the room. * Don't take, send, or keep naked pictures of yourself or other kids. * When jacking off vary your technique over the years and avoid the "death grip". * Don't be friends with other guys who play fast and loose with consent. * Girls who like sex aren't sluts, they're the ones you want to marry.
Dads of Reddit, what's it like to have a daughter?	answer1: 9 months in. It's awesome. She's a cool person, despite not being able to do too much. Her personality is just starting to develop. I think she got my mischief streak. She looks like her mom. Smiles like me. It's cool to see parts of you and your personality in another person - especially one you made with someone you love.	answer2: I was not prepared for how much I was looked at/treated like a pedofile for being in public with just my daughter and myself.
What do people consider you weird for?	answer1: I remember something funny that happened and start laughing in public. My friends always say ''Dude, what is wrong with you?''	answer2: I am constantly called out for seeming to know too much about too many things. As if I am boasting of being some sort of know it all. Actual fact is - I am a polymath (look it up) with an IQ over 140 and a lifetime of experience doing high level work in about 18 different job/work environments. I had an interest in, followed up by readings in, or experience working at Bridge, skiing, competitive swimming, astrophysics, technology, metallurgy, radio/TV writing, producing presenting acting, automobiles, literature, speculative fiction, BDSM, photography, movie making, farming, eco-home building, antiques, ice hockey, home and furniture restoration, wooden boats, foreign language translation, swords and fencing, sailing and landscape gardening. You know - the usual stuff. And I do not watch TV.
In the UK it's essential for older men to have a retreat from the family - The Shed. What is the equivalent in your Country?	answer1: Isn't this kinda messed up when you think about it. It is generally excepted that men are supposed to have a retreat from family but women women are discouraged?	answer2: Here in the US we call it the Man Cave. They are not always a separate structure from the house like a shed (though sometimes they are), but instead they are usually a room of the house dedicated to a specific purpose. For some, it functions like an office, but for others it may be an entertainment center. What is funny is that for my parents it is my mom that has a room like this. My dad is an extrovert so he is fine with doing whatever he needs to in a room with other people, but my mom is an introvert and so has an office that has doors she can close off from the rest of the house.
What ended up being a deal breaker in your relationship that you didn't think would bother you at the start?	answer1: His critical nature. I didn't think anything of it at first, because it was always directed at other things (movies, other people's houses, books, etc.). But then, when I became the target .... wow, that was not ok.	answer2: Having a cat. I am very allergic, and don't like them. I thought I could deal, it was his pet. Total nightmare. That cat was the root of so many problems.
what is something that genuinely scares you?	answer1: that i kill myself 40+ hours a week just for the government to steal a 1/3 of it from me. that means i work at least 13.3 hours for nothing a week. i would rather have that time to myself.	answer2: Being unwanted, alone, abandoned. Not amounting to shit in life. Disappointing my family and myself. Basically failing in general. But like really failing. Only issue is i dont know what is consider true and utter failure.
Why was your worst date the worst?	answer1: It was at a very Christian university where he lived in an all boys dorm. He paraded me around to each room just to prove he actually brought a girl home and made a big show out of closing the door "for privacy." Proceeded to make me sit on the floor the whole time because the only seat in his room was his bed and he wasn't allowed to share a bed with a woman til marriage. Saw him again anyway 🤦🏽‍♀️	answer2: He took me to an Ethiopian restaurant (I’m all for trying new foods so it wasn’t the fact that this was something new, but extremely daring for a first date) then took me to that god-awful movie The Wolfman that came out in 2010. At the end of the date he tried to feel me up while he drove me home. I never spoke to him again after telling him that it wouldn’t work out.
What is the best drugstore beauty product you've purchased?	answer1: My sister once bought this face cleanser with sulfur from Germany (I think) that was *amazing!* I've never seen it since :(	answer2: Milani lipsticks are my all time favorite. They have three lines (Color Statement, Moisture Matte, Amore Matte Lip Creme) and I love all of them. The staying power and shade range is something I'd expect from a much higher end brand. I'm also super impressed by the Color Icon Blushes by Wet n Wild. I don't think I'll ever hit pan on the one I have. It's so pigmented that I barely have to tap my brush on it to get enough product.
What are some books that every woman should read?	answer1: A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. Gives a woman's point of view in a place where woman have no rights(Afghanistan). I highly recommend this book to everyone.	answer2: Taking Charge of Your Fertility, by Toni Weschler. Even if you don't plan to have children. *to note: I'm not sure that transwomen will get much out of it, and I apologize for leaving y'all out.
As I've gotten older, I found myself turned off by full on pussy shots that 21 year old me would've loved. What has changed for you since you've gotten older that you used to like and now can't stomach it?	answer1: Music. Not that I cant stomach it, I just honestly dont give a shit. I have music I used to listen to that I like, but when I have free time I usually engage in intellectual pursuits like reading something or listening to some podcast on an interesting subject. Anymore I only listen to music when I run or when I'm at a bar.	answer2: Things young men often like, but I don't any more: cheap booze, validation from my friends, packaged junk food, sweet soda pop (I can still take dryer sodas, like ginger ale). Things that I still haven't outgrown at 46 and probably won't ever: fatty and salty foods, video games, fascination with boobs.
What up with guys loving their head and beard being scratched?	answer1: depends my head is covered in tumours so when a girl tries to scratch my head she usually comes away with bloody fingers. but generally its considered pleasent.	answer2: basically, every man is touch-starved from a very early age. it's a cultural problem and its known to be a contributing factor to a lot of health problems. ladies, touch your man more, he needs it.
What book(s) are you currently reading?	answer1: I'm currently reading **Stillhouse Lake** by Rachel Caine. It's about a woman who discovers that her husband's a serial killer after he gets caught, and is dealing with the aftermath of everything. I'm a huge fan of thriller/mysteries.	answer2: I'm reading The Handmaid's Tale for school, about 3/4 done with it. Honestly I think it's pretty interesting so far but too bad I heard (from a friend) that the show was bad.
Females, how important is the bottom 1/2 centimetre of a man's left earlobe to you when dating?	answer1: I love pointing out men with bad earlobes in public, and then laughing at them with my girlfriends because they're such creeps and they'd never, ever stand a chance with us. And when I do spot a man with a good earlobe, I like to surreptitiously reverse-pickpocket my hair bands into his pockets to mark my territory so other females know to keep their distance.	answer2: What the fuck did I just stumble into? Man the 9th page of /r/all gets weird. I really should get ready for work.....
What’s better than taking a tight ponytail out of your hair after an 8 hour shift?	answer1: **Status: Topic locked.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	answer2: **Status: Topic locked.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
What stereotype about men has the most negative effects on women?	answer1: That men are hapless at housework and childcare. Women are automatically expected to be maternal and the primary caregivers because our society acts like if you leave a guy alone with a kid long enough it'll end up sticky, starved, and tied to a car roof rack going "wheeeee!" as Daddy speeds along the motorway.	answer2: That women are less rational/are crazy. It invalidates us, and it's a convenient go-to for whenever some douche doesn't understand and/or likes what he's hearing.
Women of askwomen, is there a female equivalent of a guy with a neckbeard/fedora?	answer1: The pin-up hair and cat-eye glasses combo, I think. [Google search result for "pin-up hair and cat eye glasses" so you know what I mean.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f4/89/94/f4899405bb24f7b30e0e272c5a4bb105.jpg).	answer2: There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between "nice guys" who complain about getting "friend zoned" versus girls who complain about never being more than a fuck buddy. The nice guy does all the nice relationshipy stuff and thinks it will lead to sex and the girl does all the sexual stuff and thinks it will lead to a relationship.
Have you ever had a dream which makes you sad after you wake up?	answer1: Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?	answer2: Had a dream where I ran into someone who had stopped talking to me that I missed very much. We caught up and it felt so good, I woke up feeling so much joy because it had been so vivid. After a few seconds I realized I was still in my room and I had just woken up, and wave of intense sadness washed over me.
Guys who have been proposed to: How did you react? Did you know it was gonna happen?	answer1: I was thinking about proposing to my girlfriend at the end of our month-long trip to Thailand. One night in the middle of the vacation while we are boning, she looks me in the eye and says "Will you marry me?" I go "Did you just ask me that?" She says "Please?" with puppy dog eyes. I say yes and we finish boning. It was such a surprise, but a very welcome one. It made me so damn happy and honestly took an insane amount of pressure off me. We also like telling people that she proposed.	answer2: I laughed at him and said if he felt like he could propose to me he didn't know me well enough. Edit: If you are confused I am a dude.
Female friends of yours have talked about/know your penis size. How do you feel about it?	answer1: I have a small penis. My ex told her friends, her friends would make snide comments about it in a "joking way", they brought it up constantly, somehow managed to relate everything I say back to my penis, cut off all contact with them, now have no friends.	answer2: My ex actually bragged about my size and performance while drunk when I was present in a bar. It was kinda funny but nothing more. I don't care who knows, it's just a penis.
What do you think about being in a long-term relationship with someone who has “less ambition” than you?	answer1: I’ve dated multiple people who didn’t have as much ambition as I did and all it really did was hold me back from opportunities and things I wanted to accomplish. After I got out of those relationships and I things for myself, it showed me I want to be with someone who’s ambitious and cares about where their life is going. Contentment is one thing, stagnancy is another.	answer2: Frankly, I suspect a relationship where both people are equally ambitious would be tough. What if one career offers a transfer to another city, and the couple has to choose whose career to prioritize, whose to hurt? As long as the less ambitious person realizes that long hours are a permanent part of the package and the more ambitious one realizes they'll be picking up the financial load, I don't see a problem with a "mixed" relationship in this way.
Girls who like to workout. What is the most uncomfortable situation you've been in at a gym?	answer1: WOW, Im shocked, 159 comments, and not ONE of them about a trans woman in a locker room? Is everyone here from North Carolina? Shocked, SHOCKED I say! /s	answer2: I worked out at the local stripper gym because it was the closest to my house and open 24 hours. (Stripper gym because the guy who owned tons of local strip clubs bought all of his dancers memberships there, so there were always tons of exotic dancers there working out.) I made it about 6 months before canceling my membership because a lot of the men working out there felt very free to comment on, approach, or touch the women working out there. Sure, lots of those guys got kicked out by management, but it seemed like there were always dozens more ready to take their place. It sucked, though, because the women are all very sweet and supportive of each other.
What does it mean when a man says "society views me as expendable"?	answer1: Well, for one, all those god damn "Let's end Women's cancer!" banners plastered all over the walls every time I go in for chemo. What am I, chopped liver?	answer2: Genital mutilation. Couple girls start having it done in countries halfway across the world and there is a global call for action. Nearly all men had their genitals mutilated here in the US and no one cares that it was done without our consent.
Do women check out men?	answer1: Excuse me for commenting in the subreddit, but may I suggest that you start lifting weights and dieting. If you're dedicated by this time next year you will be getting checked out and likely *asked out*. Source: Personal experience. Again, sorry for not being a woman and commenting!	answer2: Oh I do it ALL the time. I love looking at men. I just don't make it obvious like you guys do. Question for you: would you *like* for a girl to make it obvious? Edit: the men have spoken! I've decided to make it more obvious when I check guys out. I'll try not to be creepy. ;)
What do you prefer and why - condo or house living?	answer1: House. Condo is just a glorified apartment, and you often have association fees. I like being responsible for my living area, not everyone else's.	answer2: HOA's are the worst. Buy a house. Plus new construction is shit in comparison to a good solid house that was built in the mid 20th century.
Donald and Ivanka got me thinking. How is your relationship with your father?	answer1: My dad is cool. He rides motorcycles and plays bass. He's always been super supportive of everything I've done and helped get me through undergrad financially and otherwise. Now, I'm almost done with my Ph.D. and he is very proud. He's retired and divorced now. He works on doing his own stuff for the most part since me and my brother are much older now.	answer2: Great. When I was a kid, my dad didn't interact with me much. I have since found out this is because he, like me, has no idea how to interact with children. As an adult we have long conversations about work, friends, social problems, etc.
Fellow men, how do YOU handle the "nothing" phone call?	answer1: 1. ask her any question 2. ask a question about her answer 3. relate 4. repeat eg, 1. Do you like bacon? 2. Why not? 3. yeah, I hear you. It is sad to see the pictures of pigs in tiny cages that the PETA volunteers pass out downtown by Frank's Bar. 4. Ever go to Frank's Bar? The structure will quickly dissolve because you'll have hit on some common interest and you'll be asking questions and relating anecdotes because you are actually interested and engaged in the subject. Bonus round: when you relate, make a joke or witty observation or gently poke fun at her, get her laughing. Expert mode: make those jokes flirtatious. Sprinkle in very light innuendo.	answer2: I too have noticed this tendency of women to call you up and discuss nothing. My wife does it to me all the time - usually she picks the most inconvenient time to call - a time when she knows that I'll be in the middle of cooking dinner. Sigh..... It's an annoying tendency many women have - but it is harmless and, if it makes them feel better, then why not engage them. Women and men are different, and its better that we try to accommodate those differences.
Inspired by an AskWomen Thread: Bicurious men who have tried having sex with men, what made you dislike it?	answer1: Definitely the kissing aspect or anything sensual. It’s definitely a shame most women are wet fish by comparison in the bedroom. Edit: Am really sorry but there is much more zest I’ve found in men over women. It’s my experience not saying it’s true all over and that’s the question the OP asked so get over it	answer2: Honest answer. I dont know. Kissing heavy petting all that shit, up and eager. Reached the bedroom, stripped off ready to go and BOOM, soft, couldn't get it back up.
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO over something that was outside their control?	answer1: Yes. He was quite short but otherwise attractive and funny so I gave him a try. I just couldn't find him attractive though. I couldn't see him as a man. Also his dick was unfortunately proportionate. I feel so bad for the guy	answer2: Yes! One of the first guys I kind of dated right out of high school. Sweet guy but had a falsetto'ish voice. I really tried to get over it but no, just couldn't. I sadly did the fade. Ran into him years later and nope, still couldn't get over it.
What food were you eating "wrong" for way too long? How did you realize what the "right" way was?	answer1: carbs, particularly "healthy" carbs like fruits or whole grain breads and what not. used to think it was healthy to just eat an acai bowl and loads of fruit or whole grain toast. but it has so much sugar and carbs even if we think it's just "fruit=healthy" sure it's natural, but it's not healthy to eat that much sugar. or most breakfasts, you think fruit, some yogurt maybe, some orange juice or oatmeal. if you count the carbs it's just so much sugar you might as well eat a slice of cake instead.	answer2: When I was a kid I would chew on the muffin paper when I was done. I don’t remember swallowing it - it was more like muffin flavored gum. Then I’d spit it out when it wasn’t sweet anymore. In my defense, my mom didn’t let us have a lot of sweets.
Ladies who dated in high school, what was your experience? What would you say to high school students who are in/want to be in relationships?	answer1: LPTs about dating: Only date guys who DO good things are ARE good natured. If he acts like an asshole, he is an asshole. Don’t make excuses for him like “I know he’s good inside” or “he could be such a great guy if...” Also, NEVER consider time in a relationship an investment. What I mean by this is, never say to yourself “but we’ve been together for one year and I don’t want to have to start over with someone else now.” Allow break ups to happen. At the time it may feel like you’ll never recover and that no one can understand what your going through, but you will, and most every person can understand and knows how hard a break up can feel. You are never alone.	answer2: Don't date in high school. Focus your energy on having FUN, new experiences, learning skills, and cultivating solid friendships (and planning your future!) If you decide to date, choose someone who shares your interests and have fun together. If you find yourself bogged down in emotional quagmires and fights, GTFO (by clearly and kindly telling the person it's over, not ghosting or being passive aggressive. Practice the difficult parts of relationships with civility). Never ever be afraid to say NO to anything. It's not rude.
who is the dumbest person you've ever dated?	answer1: I dated a guy who told me tapioca and rice were the same thing (like tapioca pudding was just another name for rice pudding). I don't think it's a big deal making a mistake like that, people make silly mistakes, but when I told him that wasn't accurate, he got really mad at me and kept insisting and saying that he knew more about food than I did (he wanted to be a chef). So later I looked it up and he got really, really mad and said, "You always have to be right, don't you?!" No. I just ... was right.	answer2: My roommate dated a girl who came to the apartment one time to watch a movie. She was perusing my DVD collection for something to watch. And after about four minutes of silent looking, she says, "Oh, they're in alphabetical order." It took a lot to stifle a condescending comment.
What have the questions asked in this subreddit taught you about guys?	answer1: That there are guys out there who are even more sensitive or concerned about their interactions with the opposite sex than I am. I find that interesting somehow.	answer2: That dudes will always be praying that there is some all-encompassing answer that they can get from one woman that will help them understand the rest.
What are your tips for moving in with your SO?	answer1: There are relationship issues, and there are rooommate issues. Learn the difference between the two and don’t let one affect the other.	answer2: Write a Roommate Agreement first. Everything must be in writing...money, bills, chores, tv shows, bed time, weekend plans. How to settle arguments... All of it. On paper.
If you were friends with your S.O. before you started dating, how did your relationship change from platonic to romantic?	answer1: We had both recently ended other relationships we were in, and moved out of a flat we shared. Two things happened: 1. Because we weren't flatmates anymore, we actually had to schedule time to see each other. That little change made our hang outs feel WAY more like dates. 2. I was pretty good friends with his ex girlfriend. This one time, we were hanging out and I was trying to figure out why he broke up with her and we just ended up spending hours talking about romantic relationships and what we each wanted in a partner. We were pretty much describing each other. I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently he did. We've been married for 5 years now. It's been great. We did good.	answer2: I tried to set my now-boyfriend up with my then-best friend, only to have him reject and ghost her brutally 2 days later. I didn’t have an explanation when she found out we were dating 2 weeks following him rejects her.
What advice do you have for girls that are a bit jealous of better looking girls?	answer1: 1) Get fitter. Are all your friends at 18% bodyfat? Because otherwise, there's work they could be doing. 2) Dress better. Get better hair and makeup. These things matter a lot. 3) Don't make your self-worth all about how you look. Develop a personality and become successful in your career. These things matter a lot more for happiness in the long run, and even if you're the hottest woman in the world at 22, by 32 you will not be anymore. That's what I'd tell them, anyway. Maybe that's why nobody complains to me about this kind of shit anymore.	answer2: You're extremely susceptible to some douchebag just saying what you want to hear (that you're really much prettier than her) to get into your panties.
Who was the truly nicest guy you've ever met, and what was he like?	answer1: He adopted our friends kid the day we knew she was dying . He helped her through the process of wills and everything and made sure she didn't have to worry about the after. She spent her last days being able to do her bucket list with her child, with money he provided. He set up a trust for her child with everything he had in his savings so that she can physically see that financially he was covered. He asked her to write a book of her wishes for her son so that he can carry them out and raise him in a way that she would like. He helped her write letters and birthday cards for her son and they celebrate her birthday, mother's day, etc so that she is always a part of his life.	answer2: Honestly... All the men in my life have disappointed me, even the “nice ones”. The only men in my life I can count on are my stepdad and grandad, they give me hope I’ll find someone nice one day.
What are your gym annoyances/pet peeves?	answer1: Not gym, but I've recently taken up just jogging around my neighborhood early in the morning. I do this specifically because I want to greatly minimize the chance that someone will actually see me running. So my greatest annoyance is running into the guy who just HAS to walk his dogs at 5:30 in the morning. Not to sound arrogant but I can't help but feel like he's watching my ass as I jog past. Ugh.	answer2: When the machine I'm using starts making really loud squeaky noises. Most people have headphones in, but occasionally someone doesn't, and then I feel bad :(

Do you like it when people think you are innocent?	answer1: I suppose so. I smoked cannabis in front of a constable in Hyde Park at a cannabis smoke-in when I was seventeen and very stupid. He scolded me, told me I had no business being there, that I was obviously a nice girl from a good family and I had better go home or he would arrest my no account boyfriend for bringing me there. All of which, I am afraid, was true. I was a goody two shoes and when I ditched school, the assistant head master held the door open for me to leave the building. That was the extreme of my life of crime.	answer2: It's always amazed me what people will assume about you simply because you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut. Edit forgot a word
New girlfriend's abusive ex-boyfriend is threatening me, how do I go about this?	answer1: you grow a pair and knock him the fuck out! simple answer=man up or pay me 50 bucks and ill do it!	answer2: Keep records, report it to the police and attempt to get a restraining order for you and her. If you know your neighbors, give them a description of the guy and tell them to look out.
Gents - how do deal with feelings of "lagging behind" in your life?	answer1: I’m in a very similar position to you in LA, but a year younger. Living life according to some arbitrary timeline isn’t going to get us anywhere. For me, nothing has worked out according to schedule anyways. But it has worked out! So what’s the rush? Your married friends with kids or houses may be wildly unfulfilled or feel trapped. Imagine when you’re an old 85+ geezer, will you really be concerned whether or not you had those things at 31 vs 35 vs 38? A few years here and there are nothing in a lifetime.	answer2: >Thanks baby boomers for a shit housing market. You are never truly an adult until you stop blaming your parents for your problems... You are adding to your problems. Instead of just wanting a house badly, you now have the problem of feeling angry, frustrated, and demotivating yourself. Everybody wants things they can't have or have when they want it. Don't punish yourself. Identify and focus on things you can control. Keep your attention there. You may not get the house any sooner, but you will not be making yourself miserable in the meantime. If you still don't feel better consider volunteering to help people out who aren't as well off as you. It really makes you feel better fast.
What do most people overestimate or underestimate about you?	answer1: Overestimate: My ability to do a 9-5 job. I'm very skilled, but I work way under my paygrade because of my health. I can't progress consistently, and people are always disappointed in me even though I warn them that I'll progress so far and then likely crash. Underestimate: How fucking badass I can be. I got a large metal splinter in my arm and when they removed it I didn't cry out or anything. When you're in pain all the time, you just kind of manage it?	answer2: They overestimate my intelligence. I'm really not that bright. I just watch a lot of documentaries and full of useless information. I don't think anyone underestimates anything about me.
What if I’m alone forever? It happens to a lot of men right?	answer1: PLEASE people.....use the search. This kind of "I suck at dating, what do?" questions are asked almost weekly, and the advice is always the same.	answer2: PLEASE people.....use the search. This kind of "I suck at dating, what do?" questions are asked almost weekly, and the advice is always the same.
What sub-reddits are you guys subscribing to that aren't the obvious ones?	answer1: Oh baby, where can I start. /r/games A lightyear beyond the quality of /r/gaming. /r/askwomen A great laugh. What terrible advice, all the time. /r/Floridaman The worst superhero. /r/fatpeoplestories Just go read. /r/pcmasterrace Despite the circlejerk, occasionally a good resource for sales and deals on parts. In conjunction with /r/buildapc There are so, so many more. /r/justneckbeardthings. /r/enlightenedbirdmen. /r/gaming4gamers. If you're so inclined, /r/theredpill. On that last one: 80% crap, 20% amazing self improvement advice. Edit: my god, how could I forget: /r/dadjokes /r/fiftyfifty /r/beer	answer2: /r/askhistorians . Note that the moderation is extremely strict, posting joke answers on more than one occasion tends to be met with a ban. This policy is extremely popular on the sub, and it has made the sub a great place to actually learn. I'd recommend just reading unless you have experience in formal history academia. /r/NFL Quality's declining a bit as the sub grows, but still a great place for NFL news and discussion. Tone of the community is both welcoming and full of trash-talking. /r/FrugalJerk /r/Scotch /r/Games Higher quality, more on topic take on /r/gaming. Quality is slowly starting to decline a bit. /r/PCMasterRace /r/UpliftingNews
What was your experience with permanent hair removal treatments?	answer1: I am a destransitioning woman. I have a beard and all but I am afraid to use laser hair removal because testosterone pretty much ruined my skin.	answer2: I got laser hair removal and it barely worked at all. After 13 sessions, I still shave my face once a week. Any laser tech that says their machine works on light hair against light skin is scamming you. If you have dark hair against light skin, laser is great, though. Can't speak for electrolysis as I haven't tried it yet

Ladies, what are the things that your SO does that you think is cute but others would find weird?	answer1: He laughs in his sleep. He's really easy to sleep next to, doesn't snore, doesn't fidget. But he has this creepy, maniacal chuckle that only comes out while he's sleeping.	answer2: He sings and claps and makes weird noises all the time. He'll just start making up a song about something and doing a weird dance with little to no provocation. He does this usually at least once in the morning when I'm getting ready for work.
Guys, would you mind if a girl approached you in public and complimented your appearance?	answer1: Mind? It would make my fucking day. A girl complimented my shirt once and it left me on high for the rest of the day. Yes, definitely, go for it. Approach him in private, tell him you find him attractive and introduce yourself. It will go well, guaranteed.	answer2: Seeing as you think hes attractive...he prob is in general...so he wont be intimidated, and if it were me I would be attempting to plant a seed to Fuck you since your attraction is obvious
Men with small penises, how has it affected your self esteem and your sex life?	answer1: In all honesty, the only thing you can do is to bang him so much that his dick gets sore. He's not going to get over it by you being empathetic because once you say "Oh it's fine," then he knows how bad the situation really is. Just keep demanding sex from him and get him to a point where he knows you're enjoying it because you keep wanting it.	answer2: This is a little off topic, but I've been with men who are 7 inches and were still self conscious about their size. I felt bad that they felt that way.
What popular movie conveys a terrible message?	answer1: Juno. It's ok for teenage girls to get pregnant because rich couples will want to adopt the child right away. And of course the baby daddy is deeply in love and wants to be with her....that's how it always works /s	answer2: The Breakfast Club. The jerk who sexually harasses you and verbally abuses you is not dating material just because he’s being abused at home. He needs to show that he’s capable of long term change before you even begin to consider it. To show an example of the opposite: the original Beauty and the Beast. Belle initially resents the hell out of the Beast. It’s not until he shows kindness, restraint, a willingness to learn, and mercy that she falls for him.
