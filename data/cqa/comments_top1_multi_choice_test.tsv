What's the oddest thing you've done while driving alone?	Screamed as loud as I could. It brings an adrenaline rush and buys you a few minutes if you're tired and at risk of falling asleep at the wheel.	Cry, but idk if thats odd. I cry a LOT while driving. If it’s too much i have to stop somewhere bc it blurs my vision	1
What dating tips are men taught about women that don't hold true in your experience?	The idea that cold approaches work if your "technique" is good enough. No. Some of us are not receptive to cold approaches at all, ever. Rape culture is too real a fear, so try changing that before complaining that women aren't receptive to cold calls. Stranger danger.	Anything about three day rules or not calling right away because you'll seem too eager. No, don't call me every fifteen minutes. Yes, you can call me the day after -- it indicates you had fun and want to get together again. If you wait 3 or 5 or whatever the latest bullshit number of acceptable days is, I'll assume you're not that interested.	0
Men who are in their 30s, what advice will you give men in their 20s before they turn 30?	Create a routine to stay in shape, you dont have to be on the cover of mens health but start a routine now, weight is harder to knock off when you get older. This will also help with confidence and your over all health. Tomorrow is never promised	31 here. Alcohol is a waste of money. When I think about the number of cars, investment opportunities, and vacations I drank away it makes me want a drink. Alcohol is a drug. If you're serious about doing drugs then do them hard and get yourself out of the way of the rest of society. For the rest of us, don't drink. It serves no good purpose and it makes you grow titties. You don't need titties that bad.	1
What's a ridiculous rule your parents had when you were young?	Growing up, the rule via my Atlanta, Georgia retired drug enforcement cop parents was I wasn't allowed to date black guys because 'that's not what we do in this family'. Now I'm only ever date black guys, pale skin doesn't do it for me.	Mine gave me a curfew but kept pushing it back later and later - first 11, then 12, then 1. I didn't socialize much and certainly didn't party, and I got the impression that they set the first curfew expecting to have to rein me in, and then got worried I wasn't social enough so they'd push it back to try to get me to go out more. One time in my senior year I did stay out past midnight. My mom called me *losing her shit* that she wanted me home even though she knew where I was and my "curfew" wasn't passed yet. I didn't have a car, and my friends weren't ready to leave to I had to beg a boy I barely knew for a ride, basically put myself in a more dangerous situation due to my mom's anxiety.	0
Men, who was the classiest woman you ever had the pleasure of dating in your life thus far? What made her so special?	My current gf. She is unfailingly kind, friendly, and outgoing, even to people she just met, which is a rarity in general but especially in NY. She's whip-smart, confident, funny, independent, a great hostess, dresses well with a unique sense of style, generally game for everything and a joy to be around in any social situation. The biggest thing though, is that she can always carry a conversation in a way that involves everybody if need be, but is also an attentive and curious listener.	Always wore dresses, had a brilliant smile that lit up a room but it was rare to see. I don’t think she owned any yoga pants, ugg boots, crocs, Nutella, Netflix, Social Media, all the ‘basic shit’ that makes people...well, boring. She didn’t have it in her life and as a result her world didn’t revolve around it.	1
When you are in a relationship do you still accept offers to have coffee or "hang out" with other guys?	Depends. I have male friends with whom I drink coffee, go clubbing, everything. But if it's someone I just met I'd make sure he knows that I have a boyfriend, just to prevent awkward situations in case he was thinking about being more than friends. But when it's clear that I have an SO, I see no harm whatsoever in drinking coffee with a guy.	Yeah, but only someone I am already decent friends with. I am bi so if my partners had issues with it, then i could never hang with my friends.	1
Does your dream lesbian wedding involve two tuxes, two dresses, one of each, or other clothing options for the couple?	I'm a femme who loves femmes. So two dresses. My idea for the aisle is either two aisles and we meet in the middle, OR one of us walks the aisle and the other one is raised up from an underground platform amidst a buncha smoke and laser lights.	Two dresses, but only if I get to pick out both dresses because I am a control freak with specific taste.	1
What's a dating advice that sounds good on paper but falls flat IRL?	Any time someone says that looks don't matter, I roll my eyes. While I don't think they should be the *only* thing that matters, physical attraction is pretty important.	"try actually approaching men first instead of waiting for them to approach you" i mean if they're not approaching you they probably dont want you, but ok.	1
Have you ever asked a girl out even though you assumed she would say no?	Every single time. So if she says no I won't be disappointed and if she says yes I get a pleasant surprise. And it works. Does it increase my success rate? Sort of, I asked out more people so there is a chance they say yes compared to not asking and not having a chance at all.	I have unacceptable skin condition, so asking out is not an option. My action corresponding to your asking out is asking a woman to talk with me. I did that 120+ times in the last 4 and a half years and only this month I've succeeded for the first time. So there were more than hundred times when I assumed they'd refuse, often harshly and vulgarly, and all but one actually did. I guess this is irrelevant to you.	1
What's the worst "hack" you've seen on the internet?	Any lemon stuff and 5 minutes craft. Never tried any of this, dont want to anyway, ive actually seen people trying on the internet and the outcome was always the same " stupid, dangerous, pointless, ineffective, etc" and it never came out like theirs.	Oh man. I follow a Kmart (different in australia, think trendy, fast fashion homewares for super cheap) hack callout group on Facebook. My favourite was this one person posted their small shelving hack. The hack was that they put things on the shelf. But they called it a hack. I damn near lost it.	0
When you were broke (or if you currently are), in what ways does/ did it "cost a lot to be poor"?	My mom makes $90,000 a year working as an R.N., which was too much money for me to receive financial aid for college. So, I had to take out the loans for my $26,000 yearly tuition. I get that she makes a lot of money annually, but how is she supposed to give me 30% of her annual income to go to school?! Luckily, I got grants for grad school.	One of the biggest ones I remember was being too broke to afford a bus pass so I'd have to pay the fare everytime. I'd spend way more every month than a bus pass (especially because I would have got a student discount on the pass) but I didn't have enough for that upfront purchase.	0
A girl whom I could have slept with but didn't just posted a picture of herself in a schoolgirl outfit. Which "what if"s keep you up at night?	Honestly? Steel. Specifically, how to make steel. Had this weird late night *"what if I get sent back in time to the upper neolithic"* thought and I lay in bed for hours thinking about it, and the thing that most concerned me was that I didn't know how to make steel. So eventually I caved, booted up the PC and googled it; only after that was I able to sleep.	is there really a point in thinking about what ifs? you make your decisions judging by what you feel is best for you at that time so there is nothing to feel bad about. you want sex? rub one out and with new clarity ask yourself what made you not sleep with her in the first place. for example if you didn't because you had a relationship already. good for you you are not a total asshole. if it was because she had a odd personality quirk. good for you never stick your dick in crazy. if it was simply because it wasn't the right time, well you always have priorities that come first that's life. move on	1
How do I hold myself accountable and make myself get off my ass and do what I need?	Stop viewing decisions as choosing what to do, and start viewing them as choosing who to be. When the alarm goes for the gym and your hand is hovering over the snooze button, don't ask yourself if you want to sleep for another ten minutes. Ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who is lazy and doesn't follow through on commitments. I can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but it will be a lot more effective. And once you start living a life that is consistent with your personal values, your self esteem will rocket upwards.	I’m the same way. I just sit around until one day I feel like doing it and I get it done. I do this with every single thing	1
What are your life goals?	• move to a country with a better quality of life and warmer climate • get a job that pays well enough for me to be able to afford my own apartment and a retirement • make that apartment the coziest place on Earth • find a better life/work balance that would allow me to spend more time at the gym, read more books and write down short stories that I occasionally come up with • travel every now and then to see more of the world • retire as a slightly eccentric, active, ridiculously healthy old lady with tons of stories to tell and hobbies to keep me busy	I’ve already achieved most of them (career, house, child) so now my main goal is to enjoy life and prepare for a happy retirement	1
Women who had non-traditional weddings: how much pushback did you get from friends and family? What was the worst?	My husband I eloped with our best friends at a castle. We already had a kid, a house, the whole 9, and didn't want to shell out for a huge wedding (his side is basically My Big Fat Greek Wedding so his guest list would start at 120, just "immediate family"). And we wanted were some nice pics, you know? His side was annoyed..."why didn't you do it at the church?" "What about having a reception?" Can't you get remarried at Fancy Country Club?"...and we'd say back, "Sure Aunt Bertha! Thanks for offering to pay!" They shut them up fast lol. But after a few weeks it all calmed down and no one cares about it. Except my MiL, but she's a monster.	My aunt got married by someone who was ordained on the Internet. With my father, a qualified and educated minister licensed to officiate weddings in all 50 states, sitting in the audience. He took it as a huge slap in the face not just to him but to his profession too.	1
Germophobes, what is something you see people do that makes you absolutely cringe?	I don't know if this is a "germophobe" thing, but SNEEZE INTO YOUR ELBOW DEAR GOD PLEASE. It's so much more sanitary.	I'm not exactly a germophobe, though I flipped shit the other day when my husband wanted to thaw chicken in the sink... But, I'm an allergy mom... I'm absolutely paranoid about cross contamination. My son is breast fed (he's only 5 months old), so it's my food I have to be careful of, but I've watched my mom butter a slice of bread and then use the same knife to scoop out jam. So the jar of jam is now contaminated. I worry a lot about stuff like that.	1
What stereotype about women do you conform to?	I love love love make-up, I'm seriously emotional at times, and I was in a sorority... And I have an English degree, which I always assumed was really feminine. And I love dresses and heels way more than I should. And babies. I want all of the babies. But I also like superheros (and cosplay), attempt to use logic over reason, and have been kicking ass and taking names in Math classes since I was young.	* I own way more clothes and shoes than any one person could possibly need * The Twilight movies are my worst guilty pleasure and IDGAF who knows anymore * I constantly anthropomorphize animals and objects when I think they're cute * I scream and run away from most bugs * While I don't *love* it, I get a lot of satisfaction out of cooking/cleaning/caring for my SOs * I have perfected the skill of being friendly and polite in person to people I can't fucking stand; most people I actively dislike don't have a clue that I dislike them at all * I have had a legitimate chocolate emergency before wherein I ordered $25 of chocolate and paid $12 to have it delivered to me within 2 hours via Amazon Prime Now at 11PM	0
Who is your favorite rapper?	I love Run the Jewels! Idk I just enjoy all of their songs, but I'd recommend listening to Blockubuster night	Macklemore. I can't put down his new album. I'm addicted! Lil dicky is a close second though followed by Kanye, Jason Derulo and anyone who has rapped about butts Edit: when you get down voted and you don't know why! Guys feel free to down vote me but at least let me know why haha	1
What is something you often hear women say they want in a man, but you think they wouldn't like if they actually got it?	A good man. The good guys end up timid, unskilled, inexperienced and respectful with a so-so job. The not so good have the skills and initiative and force of personality to get what they want, which is, laid, with a more high-status job. Or the hottie wife.	"Treat me the same as you do your guy friends." Begged me to stop the next day, didn't realize how much special treatment she was getting as a girlfriend.	0
Doctors of r/AskWomen, have you ever suspected a patient of yours was lying to you for any reason and, if so, why?	Not a doctor, but doctors ALWAYS seem to think I'm lying about my issues and I just have anxiety. Unable to breath? Anxiety (I had scaring on lungs) Fainting? Anxiety (I was deficient in key nutrients) Extreme Fatigue? Anxiety (CFS)	Patients lie literally all the time for many different reasons. A lot of times they lie because they are embarrassed about something. Other patients lie to try to get something they want (this could be something like “yes, I’m feeling much better” when it doesn’t really seem like they feel better because the patient wants to go home from the hospital or to get paperwork signed for work or many other things). Some patients are such sweethearts that they lie to make you feel better. For example some patients will lie and tell you that whatever you prescribed or recommended helped even though they didn’t do you don’t feel like you failed or something (please don’t do this, it’s really sweet but we can’t help you if we don’t know something is wrong!).	0
Frizzy medusas of Reddit, what are some do's and don't's regarding your mane of snakes?	Medusas? I'm seeing a lot of people with curly hair replying, but that's usually a term for women with dreadlocks. Can you clarify?	No hairbrushes. Ever. No sulfates. Much conditioner. Don't play with hair unless you want to look like a crazy cat lady. No tight braids, no tight elastics, no heat styling. No ammonia in hair color. When shampooing, wash scalp only. Leave conditioner until right before exiting the shower. No fluffing hair with a towel- wrap it (just tight enough to stay put) and leave it alone.	0
What is your favorite standup available on Netflix?	Aziz Ansari. Almost everyone else is either a white guy making fun of women or minorities, or a woman or person of color making white people feel comfortable laughing at them.	If you're into strange humor and awkward delivery Eugene Mirman (voice of Gene from Bob's Burgers) has a standup out. Also, a lot of Bob's Burgers is on Netflix, if not all of it.	0
What is the stupidest mistake you have made while cooking?	I once tipped *all* (and I mean all) the spaghetti I'd cooked for a dinner party into a sink of dirty dish water when I was trying to drain it. Fuck it, I clawed it out with my bare hands, rinsed it under some boiling water and served it anyway. I figure, it's not as bad as the time I probably served up broken glass in a lamb tagine, to four people. Hmm. Maybe should have told that story.	unsure if this counts... i'd heard of using vinegar to do a clean cycle on the coffee machine. having never used vinegar to clean before, i did this with balsamic. which meant i had to do like 4 more water cycles to get the balsamic vinegar taste under control.	0
Yesterday was the first time in my life I've seen a man breakdown crying. I've never felt so bad for anyone prior to this. Does anyone else relate?	People try so incredibly hard to hide our weaknesses from others, I think guys especially are incredibly discouraged from showing vulnerability. It was probably so tough for him to open up like that. Whenever I see another person do something like that, I always just feel in my head like, "OMG I go through those feelings too, you have no idea how much." It's almost like I feel like I've found a comrade or something.	I've not got enough time to read what you wrote, and I apologize for that. I have noticed over the last few months that for myself weakness can be my strength. I think it takes much more strength to be weak than it does to not show weakness in our culture.	1
Cat owners, what has your experience been?	Mostly frustration and caving to their needs, the little assholes. Seriously: They're the best. My cats got fleas recently and it's been a really trying ordeal because it's a longterm problem and I've never dealt with it. Sometimes they are sick, sometimes they are super affectionate, sometimes they couldn't give less of a fuck about me. But I love them unconditionally. They're my cats and I'm their human. **Edit:** Y'all are flea experts and I love you all.	I love one of my cats, I tolerate the other. I treat them the same, but I regret getting the second one. She's moody and weird, something we chalk up to her being taken from her mom at 3 weeks old. If I believed in putting cats outside for good she'd probably be a permanently outdoor cat. She's gone outside for a couple days during the day at a stretch when she tore the shit out of my arm for no apparent reason. If she ever does that to my kids, though, she's gone for good. I can understand defensive scratching, if my kids mess with her and she scratches and runs, fine. She's the kind of cat who has a note on file at the vet's office for how unnecessarily aggressive she can be.	1
I'm tired of all the relationship questions on askmen. What type of music do you guys like? What song have you been listening to on repeat lately?	Right now, I really like Die Antwoord, Parkway drive, Iron maiden, A LOT of classical music, Led Zeppelin, and some Kendrick Lamar. I try to listen to a lot of different music. I want get into music from around the world, in other languages besides English and Spanish. Die Antwoord and Sigur Ros are my first artists in this aspect.	I've been listening to a playlist made of albums from Coheed & Cambria, Blink 182, 1989 by Taylor Swift, MMLP2, The BTVS Once More With Feeling soundtrack, the Frozen soundtrack, Jimi Hindrix Greatest Hits, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Panic!, Royal Blood, and Meghan Trainer. My goto song right now is Sentry The Defian by Coheed. Second would be Random Reality Shifts, by Coheed. And then Castles Made of Sand by Hendrix.	1
What was your "Fuck, I need to turn my life around" moment?	Got up one morning and decided it had been a while since masturbating and having sex and i was gonna get a hooker. Dont regret it one bit but afterwards all i could think was that was great but deadliftings better. Gone from 80kg to 140kg in 3 weeks.	College drop out. Moved back to my parents place and would regularly sleep in until 6pm since I stayed up playing video games all night. One day my friend told me "if your true love could see how you live for 24hrs. What would she think?" That was a good kick in the ass.	0
What is the most polite way to remove one's self from a date when the woman lied/tricked you about her appearance and you don't wanna advance?	Straight up. "I'm not feeling a connection." Edit: let me clarify. This is what I would say to someone. To me it is about connection, I want to feel a feiry passion for which I want to fuck/or get fucked for hours. And/or cuddle. My point is be honest and upfront. Dont waste people time. She obviously wasted yours by her lies. You aren't being rude in telling her like it is. Maybe gays are more casual about it.	I feel like you should confront her a bit and tell her that she doesn't look like what you were expecting and tell her to stop using deceptive images regarding her appearance so the situation doesn't end up happening again. Tell her that maybe someone else might like how she looks but you're not interested because you were trying to meet up with the girl that she used as her profile or posed as.	1
I have a daughter with another on the way. What is the one thing your Dad did right/or wish your Dad did?	My dad loves the crap out of me. That makes all the mistakes I can see as an adult ok. * He remembered to change how he treated me as I got older by gradually treating me more as an equal. * He is always gracious to new boyfriends. * He always encouraged me into math and science but never made it about me being a girl. Instead it was all about bettering my future.	I have nothing to add in terms of fathering advise, but you may want to research a bit more in-depth. Delightful anecdotes from internet commenters are fine, but child-rearing is obviously a pretty broad and complex topic. Doubtless, there are hundreds of quality books in this area that are not 'hippy new age bullshit.' This is probably a good question for a research librarian, actually.	1
What's your most recent FAIL with the opposite sex?	In an episode of autism, I went up to a girl at the library and said "will you out with me"? I have no idea why	In a club on Halloween. See a girl. Smile at her, she smiles back. Do nothing. She goes away to the bar never to be seen again. Our babies would have been beautiful god dammit.	0
Ladies that attended your 10 year hs reunion what happened to most of your former peers?	I haven't been to mine yet, but I went to my husband's reunion a few years ago. We had lots of fun! Most people were really friendly. My husband had a great time since he was one of the more successful people there with a good looking SO. We may have had less fun if those circumstances were different. But I'm not sure I will go to mine. I don't really want to see those people.	I've only been out of high school for five years, but I feel like Facebook has ruined the surprise of X-year reunions. I *know* what my graduating class has been up to, I *know* who got fat/thin/married/pregnant/etc. Even if I liked any of those people I have nothing to talk about with them because people my age just continually share every minute detail of their lives online.	0
What monthly subscription boxes do you use or highly recommend?	I really like Dollar Shave Club. If you want a really nice razor it's probably not the way to go, but I like being able to get razor blades for $6 every two months straight to my doorstep. And the blades are better than anything I could ever find at a grocery/drug store without buying really expensive ones.	Man, the disappointment when you come in a thread hoping to find a cool box to buy your girlfriend (she doesn't wear make-up ever) or shaving boxes (she doesn't have body hair / waxes once a month).	1
What's an academic or work related achievement you're really proud of but can't talk about?	Failing yoga. It’s the easiest course to take in highschool but i still managed to fail lmao. This is like legit one of my fave accomplishments from highschool. That and like having a great comeback from being hella depressed the year i failed a bunch of shit to gettjng straight a’s the next year ;p . But ya failing yoga.	I did pretty well last semester. I'm in law school so it's highly, highly competitive. It's all a curve so it all depends how well you do compared to the rest of the classmates vs. just knowing the material. (Everyone in law school knows all the basic material anyway) I don't want to talk about my grades because I know a lot of people didn't do well or as well as they'd hoped. Most people just want to be median but I made it way above median (like top ~20%.) I'm pretty happy about it but I don't want to brag in front of people who didn't do as well. EDIT: Btw, congratulations on graduating early! That's amazing!	0
Women who have had an abortion...what's something you wish you would've known beforehand?	I was gonna abort but I went to abortion counselling first. After that I felt I was more informed about pregnancy so I felt more confident about keeping the baby. I am grateful for having my son now. Without the counselling I would have gone straight to abortion without any hesitation. So I think many girls who are not sure- maybe hearing it from both sides will help you make an informed decision.	How much better I would feel immediately afterwards and how much worse people would make me feel about it later on. No regrets though!	0
What are some signs of disrespect that you might have experienced in relationships?	Not answering calls or texts because of stress/busy/whatever. If I'm calling or texting my SO it's because I care and to ignore that is pretty disrespectful.	Always answering you in a passive way. It usually means you're SO is starting to get tired of you and doesn't even have the gall to tell you off. Usually leads to a huge bottling of emotions instead of talking problems through to fix them. "So how was your day?" "Fine" "You wanna go somewhere today?" "If you wanna go then go ahead" "Where do you want food from?" "You pick whatever place you want." "Hey is everything alright?" "I don't know is everything alright?"	0
What's the line between nice and leading a guy on?	I'm attracted to pretty girls that are nice to me. I also tend to be friends with girls that are nice to me. So if you're my friend, you're pretty, and you're nice to me and you're available, chances are I will ask you out. You're not doing anything wrong. These things just happen. When I think "leading someone on," it's generally more of a conscious decision to pretend to like someone in order to get attention/benefits/etc. Those people who do that are awful, like you said.	In my opinion, if a guy likes a girl it's his responsibility to ask her out (similarly if a girl is into a guy it's in her best interest to make her feelings known directly). Up to that point it's not your responsibility to do anything. Once you're asked out you need to be direct and final in your answer, don't try to soften the blow at all, just let him know you aren't interested in a romantic relationship. Most guys will ask a girl out before they're head over heals into her and can accept rejection stoically. The people who don't are the squeaky wheels that you hear about all of the time, but honestly as long as you don't end the friendship or treat him/her like some creepy perv for showing an interest they won't hold it against you or suffer any sort of excessive emotional damage.	1
Ladies who have vaginismus and other sexually hindering conditions, how does this effect your relationships?	I have vulvodynia, which basically means that I have pain down there for no reason. For me it made even just walking painful, and it was uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Using tampons was torture, nevermind sex. Luckily for me my gyno prescribed me a med that got rid of 90% of the pain. It also seems to be related to my anxiety, as the higher my anxiety the more likely it is that the pain will flare up. I am able to have sex as long as we take it super slow, which is annoying, but luckily my boyfriend is patient.	A girl I dated a while back had this condition, and it was horrible. I myself tie emotions and sex in a way I've found few men do (at least from my own research) and so it was particularly rough on us. To the point after a few months we simply had to end the relationship over it. Granted, I was rather sexually inexperienced at the time, and we weren't sure how to handle it. But it's still a very difficult hurdle to work through.	1
Fellow ladies with a "high number" of sexual partners. How have SO's reacted when you told them. Or do you have a no tell policy? Also do you have any regrets?	I haven't been asked any of that in so long. My husband doesn't care about my number and doesn't want to know. Sure i regret some of it but mostly i just don't think about it anymore because i don't care. My mother used to call me a slut for having sex with men outside of a committed relationship but she's cheated twice, that I'm aware of. So i guess it's ok to have a lot of sex with different people if you're IN a relationship, according to her. I've never cheated. So i have my morals in tact at least.	Men who have a problem with my (high ish)number usually have other serious character flaws that would preclude any kind of relationship so yes, i have told people i dated, none who were a good person otherwise had a problem with it. I am highly incompatible with the type of guy for whom numbers would be a problem, anyway. I don't play numbers games on reddit because of ad hominem dudebros but like you, op, i started really young but other than that feel my number is highish normal- i just had a head start on some people. I too feel that it has shaped who i am and how i see sex and relationships, so i really would not change it. I have more regrets about my marriage than i do about the first time i had sex or the amount of people i have had sex with.	1
What was life for you like before and after taking antidepressants?	Before: Massive mood swings. Hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, and bursts of productivity and creativity followed by long periods of lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, self-loathing. After: bizarre behavior, paranoia, and thought I had 6th sense type superpowers. Turns out I had bipolar disorder, not depression, and so I needed a stabilizer, not an anti-depressant. After stabilizer: I have virtually no symptoms anymore. I have a full range of emotions, but my emotions and energy level are just...normal. There was no perception of “it’s working!” because nothing felt remarkable...which is actually how you know it’s working. Sharing because sometimes the first diagnosis and/or first prescription isn’t right for you, but the next one might be better.	Before: crying fits for hours, several times a week. Sitting down and looking at the wall for who knows how long. Barely went anywhere. 2 meals a day. Now: a couple crying fits a year. I'm aware that my body needs 20 mins of rest after work, and that's okay. I plan and go places. 20 meals a week.	1
What is the worst case of over sharing you've seen on social media?	Like I'll gossip with my bff about your oversharing statuses but I really try to keep in mind that it's not hurting me just because Kathy is mentally ill and needs attention. Related: I am SUPER pleased that most of the comments here are about violating others' privacy, rather than your own. NEdit: Wow the Kathy comment makes me seem like a real dillweed, so let me just say I am mentally ill and need attention like all the time. I just use different methods than angsty facebook statuses as a general rule.	The saga of my friend's baby who was dealing with constipation. Her baby was extremely constipated for a week, which I am sure is stressful since the baby was crying constantly from discomfort, but she diligently documented the events on facebook. Then posted a picture of her **exploded diaper** when the baby finally got relief. D: WHY PARENTS. WHY SHARE POOP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. (have also seen 'poop or chocolate' pictures....)	0
What is the most infuriating and frustrating argument you've ever had with a parent due to the fact that in the end, it was mainly about you being female?	A little late to the party and not entirely on topic. I'm a transgender woman and have always been very gentle/femme/soft/quiet. My parents raised me thinking I was a boy and were pretty contemptuous and intolerant of me not being masculine; I didn't play sports, I had zero interest in labor (such as helping my father and brother dig up tree trunks in the garden or build things), I had zero interest in rough-housing, I watched shows like Next Top Model, Fashion Police, and Sex in the City. Long story short, I didn't participate in a single traditionally masculine activity without being actively blackmailed/threatened into doing so by my parents. The funny thing is, my father always wanted a daughter. I shudder, looking back, at how I would have been raised if I'd been born a cisgender woman. My parents were pretty heavily invested in enforcing gender roles.	Every time my brother could be out at all hours of the night when he'd banged most of the girls in his social circle, but I wasn't allowed to be with my friends because "there are boys in that group!" Eventually I started going out whenever I felt like it, because fuck that. Still never banged my friends, still never got myself (or anyone else) pregnant. Can't say the same for my brother.	0
Women who need lots of alone time - How do you ask for space without hurting peoples feelings?	I don’t. It hurts my husbands feelings. Instead I take long lunches and spend 30-40 minutes in my car after work just playing Tetris or reading my book. It’s easier than hurting him.	I’ve found that for me, telling someone I need alone time but giving them an “end” time is helpful. Like saying “hey tonight I need some alone time but let’s talk Saturday morning. Can I call you then?” Or “I feel like I want to stay in and read tonight, but id love to hang out with you later in the week. When are you free?” If I just say I need to be alone with no resolution then that has a tendency to make people feel like they did something wrong. But if I reaffirm that I still want to talk or hang out with that person by giving them a time and letting them know that I’ll reach out or asking to make a plan makes it more clear that it’s a me thing.	0
Single men, how often do you go out by yourself? Women, how do you view men alone versus in a group?	As a man, when you go out alone it's possible to be left alone except when you want someone to interact with. That's not really true of most women. Similarly, if I go to a bar & get toasty alone, I don't have to worry about getting hit on, drugged, or for the most part taken advantage of while blacked out. Being a man is like having a super power.	I would be way more willing to approach a guy on his own than in a group. I see a group as, "We came here together to enjoy each others company, not yours." And, a person solo as "I wanted to go out and socialize, just didn't have anyone to do so with tonight." But, I probably see it that way because that's how I am about going out solo. Even if I'm in a group, I'm happy to meet new people :) Edit: I need to stop using voice to text, or check it well afterwards.	0
What is the best thing you've ever purchased from Amazon?	Fucking toilet paper. I'm not joking. The Safeway near my home sells a 24 pack of Charmin ultra strong for **$18**. These are 2 ply, regular size. Amazon sells a 48 pack of Charmin ultra strong, 2 ply large size for **$20**. I went from buying toilet paper every 2 months to every 4.5 months, for $2 extra. Free 2 day shipping with prime.	1) My Wedding Ring. :) Mexican Fire Opal. 2) Surprised no one has said lube, yet. Leave it to me to pop everyone's comfort bubble. 3) The bedhead watermelon shampoo I use when I give my dogs baths.	1
Women who have done, or are doing nude modeling, stripping, camshows, porn, prostitution, etc. (jobs primarily aimed at pleasing men sensually/sexually), how has your view of men changed from before you started this work, to now?	I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting!	I've worked as a stripper since I was 17, and yes after a while it starts to distort your view of men a little bit. You get so used to seeing men at their worst. The majority of men who come to strip clubs are in relationships or married, and they always try to get something "extra" out of the lap dances, so sometimes I have a hard time believing that men are capable of being faithful. It makes me nervous to get involved romantically with any guy. I try not to let it affect me but its hard after a while. So many of my coworkers are jaded and hate their customers, especially the ones in their 30s who have been doing it their entire adult life.	0
Homosexual men, is domestic violence as big an issue for homosexual couples as it is for heterosexual ones?	It can be. My first boyfriend broke a few of my bones, and I've called the cops on him. This was like... 10+ years ago though.	Domestic violence in same-sex relationships occurs with about the same frequency as it does in opposite-sex relationships, but it tends to be reported less and there are fewer resources available for victims. Also, we prefer the term gay, just so you know.	1
Ladies of Reddit, have you ever felt you were a “late bloomer” on something a women of your age should have down by (makeup, romance, etc)?	Um, yes? Before this year, I hadn't worn a dress (excluding when I was 4), done any makeup, worn jewelry, gone on a date (though I did have a serious relationship), done *anything* most women have done. But I'm catching up as much as I can.	I didn't have my first date until 33. I didn't learn how to do my hair until 32. I didn't learn how to do make-up, or dress in a flattering way, or any of those really girly things, until then, really. There's a correlation, I'm sure. Prior to that, I lived in books and not the real world. Sometimes I miss those times.	0
Have you ever changed your mind on something you thought was a dealbreaker for you? What happened?	Not really a deal breaker for the relationship, but I always said I'd never move into a guy's place, he'd need to give up his apartment and we'd get "our" place. I currently live with it SO in a house he owns. What happened is I guess I got older, and met a great guy who had his shit together enough to buy a house. It was more or less move in or wait forever.	When I first started dating my dealbreakers were: must be vegan, must be feminist, must be Christian and must not want children. My partner had health issues that prevented him eating vegan, he's egalitarian rather than feminist, and he's Christian but not the right kind, so to speak. Eventually I stopped being vegan and stopped identifying as a feminist and deconverted from Christianity. So I guess you can say I broke all my dealbreakers on my own? We're still good on the no kids front though.	1
What's the biggest misunderstanding between men and women in our society?	That they're somehow in competition with each other. Any time one side says they have it bad, the other side has to come out to say how they're wrong and they have it so much worse. It's like we're still in kindergarten playing boys vs girls on the playground.	That men want really skinny women. All my girl friends go on and on about how hard it is to meet up to this skinny standard of magazines and movies. And all except one of my guy friends couldn't give less of a shit. They would much rather have some boobs/ booty and a little tummy over some twig any day!	1
Have you ever had a friend you liked but hate who she is in social media?	I had a friend that I enjoyed working with, and we eventually became Facebook friends. Completely different. Super poor grammar, in the form of "ebonics" and textspeak. And her attitude was a little worse online as well. The kind of ghetto/ratchet personalities I tend to avoid. I put up with it, but I'm not all too happy seeing her posts.	>She even felt I was distancing myself (cause I didn't like her insta picture, and she noticed) and even sent me flowers. If not liking someone's instagram pictures occasionally is distancing yourself from them...I've distanced myself from my mom and like all of my friends. What on earth? Why is she keeping track? Also, sending flowers because you didn't like her picture is a *super* guilt-trip-y way for her to react.	0
How do you react to other women putting you down?	Remember that hurtful people are usually hurting a lot on the inside too. It doesn't excuse behaviour, but being nice in return can ameliorate the situation a lot more quickly and cleanly.	Also, a feigned look of pity and a gentle "I would be so embarrassed if I spoke to people the way you do." Bonus points if there are others around to hear it, as they'll always agree with you.	0
What's the female equivalent of "being a gentleman" when dating?	Being kind, attentive, and not expecting to be treated like a princess from the start. A date shouldn't be the guy doing all the work, especially if he was the one to put himself out there by asking her out first. Being willing to pay for herself, offering date ideas (this can be stressful for a lot of guys), and contributing to conversation are all nice too.	A lot of this doesn't sound "gentlemenly" to me, it more sounds patronising or mollycoddling...especially the offering to pay for everything...what year is this? Why are you impressed by a man offering you money? Buy your own dessert :) I think a better conversation is around "kindness"	1
Do you use your sick pay days and when you're not really sick, what are your reasons?	No such thing as sick days in my country, but I do occasionally stay at home without a good reason. Sometimes if I'm feeling a bit unter the weather, sometimes if I need a mental health day, sometimes if I just can't be arsed and have better plans to spend my day. At my job it also doesn't *really* matter. I should technically be in when I'm supposed to be in, but as long as my hours at the end of the month are fine noone cares.	My company just has a set amount of PTO days (paid time off). We can use them for whatever we want, no justification or explanation necessary. I often use them to just have a relaxation day, mental health break, a clean the house and run errands day, escape down the coast day, etc. One time I even used one to stay home and play the new Zelda video game for like 12 hours straight.	0
Men of Reddit: Who was the biggest douche bag you ever came across and why did they suck so bad?	I see them on a weekly basis at the gym flexing in front of mirrors, dropping weights and grunting/yelling regardless of how inappropriate it is. I don’t understand how some guys can be such enormous douchebags, the roids bring out the worst in them	Use to have an obese, divorced, pathetic unhappy sad sack of a manager at my job in HS who use to try to always tell me things starting off with "to be a man means you need to....". Meanwhile he was easily the laziest most arrogant douche I ever had the misfortune of working with.	0
Men of Reddit: You’ve had a long and stressful day and you need to unwind. Which activity, beverage and snack/meal will help you with this?	I usually destress with a nice game of Cities: Skylines, until I have to deal with solving traffic at least	Three 20 mg hydrocodone or 2 xanax bars 5 nips of jack Daniels Tennessee fire, a six pack of Heineken and watching a funny or uplifting movie I never seen before from a hot tub	1
What do men unintentionally say to you that they don't think is sexist but is?	When a guy finds out I'm in a relationship and he says "oh, he's sure a lucky guy". This especially annoys me because why can't I be the lucky one, as I actually feel I am? If it's a good relationship, which it is, my boyfriend and I should both feel equally lucky. And I do feel that way. To a lesser degree, it also annoys me because I'm bisexual and actually have a boyfriend and a girlfriend right now. I know that's too complicated for many to explain that to, but I don't think any guy as ever approached me and even considered the option I may be in a relationship with a woman. I'm not seeking attention that way, but it does bother me at times when everyone assumes you only are attracted to men.	I work in a male dominated industry and get a lot of comments from male coworkers about how surprised they are that I "turned out to be" so smart/competent/authoritative/professional etc. after they've gotten to know me. I let it slide because I know they mean well and they're not the most socially capable group of dudes but WOW talk about a backhanded compliment! I've also found that when I'm the only woman in a work group or area, I'm constantly asked how to fax things, reserve a conference room, to organize a potluck, etc. I'm not the Office Administrator and I'm definitely not your mommy.	0
Dear Women, have you ever been in a happy relationship but just felt that longing to be single? How did it come about for you?	Every once in a while I think it would be nice to be single. Usually comes up if someone attractive is flirting with me.	I really liked (like?) dating. I love the feeling of meeting someone new and thinking “wow, something might come of this!!” I like first kisses. I like going on dates. I like waiting for their text the next day. But I guess when it comes down to it, I like my boyfriend more. I have fond memories of dating, and it will just be that.	0
What was the most romantic moment you've experienced?	I met a girl outside a nightclub who immediately started making out with me, telling me I was "so fucking fit", grabbing me by the groin and shoving my hand down her shirt. Then offering me a bj in the loos.	My ex and I were sitting on the roof of her house. She was sitting on my lap and we were both staring at the stars. We had been silently staring for a while and for the first time I randomly just said "I love you" really softly. She was ecstatic because she felt the same way but was too nervous to say it. We made out on her roof for like 30 minutes. Probably going to take a while to top that one.	0
[Update - I had the interview] A potential employer made a sexual joke during our e-mailing back and forth. Bad sign?	Gross. You are doing the right thing by bringing this all up to the women counter-part. Good luck, I'd like to hear what she says.	That's not a sexual joke. A sexual joke would be: "Well, I hope you won't take up Football Fridays with HR" That guy is a straight up misogynist. And possibly a creep.	1
Ladies, do you have stories where a fellow woman helped you out when you needed help?	I was having a mini breakdown a week before midterms during my first semester of university. I was in a rarely used corner of the library having a nasty stress cry. This random older lady pulled up a chair, handed me a pack of tissues, and patted me on the back until I was done. She said she was one of the psychology professors, and she made her rounds through the quiet sections of the school around midterms and finals looking for the students that needed her. She offered a hug, a prayer, a baggie with Hershey kisses and a granola bar, and some advice for general stres relief. I later left due to financial reasons, but I never forgot how awesome she was for doing that.	I was in court for a fix it ticket in burbank with my toddler and did not have the proof showing the taillight had been fixed. The judge asked told me I could pay $20 dollars to the court and one of the court police officers would sign the paper for proof. I had no money on me so as the judge is telling me I had to go downtown to high patrol office where it's free when this kind women handed me $20 and said because I had a small child with me she wanted to make it easier for me.	1
Single men, how does your week look?	Work, take care of the house, practice sports to stay healthy, read books. play games, watch movies, reserve a couple of days every month to be with friends. Repeat. Single adulthood for the majority of people gets repetitive and boring, despite what facebook and instagram shows. If you value your own company, don't stress out, stay healthy and keep improving yourself. If you've never been in this position, now it's a good to start doing just that.	When I was single, all I would do is spend time on myself and my hobbies. I'd spend time with family and friends, I'd go shopping, sometimes alone, and take myself out. Honestly it's made me a better partner now because I know what I'm into, what I'm not, and really used it as an opportunity to find myself. Date yourself! Treat you to a cup of coffee or go see a movie alone. People say it's depressing but seeing a movie by yourself carries some serious big dick energy in my opinion. Go dancing or clubbing, go eat at a fancy restaurant, go to a wine tasting. Learn to be your own best friend and spend time with yourself. Not only will this help you heal but it'll also be fun!	1
I woke up to my roommate standing in my room, he’s male. What do?	Start by asking him. If you don’t like what you hear, consider getting a lock on your door. That is pretty weird...	Second that sleeping beauty comment. Wear a man thong with elephant trunk. 🐘 Or he could be a gay vampire a la twilight Ed ogling sleeping Bella (you)	1
What is your "just being friendly" behavior? Something you do with people that you are just being friendly with but NEVER with someone that you are romantically/sexually interested in?	For me, making friendly conversation is totally something I'd do with a stranger /someone I'm not interested in. I've been in food service for 10 years and "small talk" is just something that comes very easily. A regular I used to have said once I was the Queen of the Soundbite. :) though IN that small talk, I'd talk about inane things, easy surface things. I'll bring up the fact I have a boyfriend if it's necessary to the topic, but I try not to be one of those girls that shuts down a dude from even just a conversation by shouting out she has a bf.	Mine got all crossed around somehow, so my casual friendly does hit a lot of more typical flirty behavior. My actual interest in someone, both romantically and those be my friend type crushes, reads as awkward, stilted, and vaguely something like I don't like them at all. I've spent years trying to reverse them back how they should be, but not much success. Essentially the stranger I am around someone, the more likely it is I have some sort of investment in them. My best guess is that my natural conversation style is flirty, but once I start being invested in the outcome my anxiety takes over and my normal conversational ease and confidence just goes right out the window.	0
My Girlfriend is going to breakup with me. What do I do?	How to get broken up with like a mature adult: 1) Show up with your head held high. 2) Have an adult conversation. 3) It's OK to show some emotion, but don't lose it. 4) Say your goodbyes, go home, cry in the shower to a sad song.	Everybody here saying "go to the meeting", but I'm not sure I agree. Personally, I'd send her a text saying "If you want to meet up to talk things out and you think there's a real shot for our relationship, I'd like that. However, if you're just meeting to break up with me, then tell me now and let's not." Just what I'd do anyway.	1
What's the weirdest "woman-y" thing to happen to you?	These comments are making me feel better about my period. I have fibroid tumors on my uterus and bleed heavily as a result. I have also expelled gigantic clots that flop onto the floor or off the side of the toilet or unknowingly on my leg and I don't know it until I pull my pants back on and feel a sticky wet glob somewhere where it shouldn't be. Also, the natural disasters in my pants when I happen to sneeze, cough, laugh, or just stand up after sitting a while. I'm always impressed with the really, REALLY big clots, though. It's a weird feeling of WTF coupled with pride.	One time I was putting on mascara and I got a sneeze that I wasn't expecting, and poked my eye with the wand, got the mascara all over my brow bone, and felt a clot squish out all at the same time. It was a mess.	0
What is the most valuable thing you learned in therapy?	I've learned quite a bit in my time in therapy, and one of the things that's really helped me deal with a lot of internal self-hate is just separating that as a thought of, this is not true, this is just one negative thought that doesn't outweigh the overall general and positive experiences that show otherwise. As much as I really don't like myself some days, I have to remember that and it's really helped me.	The oxygen mask concept. Basically you have to put on your own “mask” first by improving your mental health and doing what’s best for you before you can assist others and help them with their lives. Really made me take a step back from getting involved in other people’s problems because it wouldn’t benefit me or my health.	0
Women of Reddit who did not go to college: What is your job? Are you struggling to make ends meet?	Well I do have a degree and I'm currently working a $12 an hour job. So be happy you at least don't have loans to pay too. I did have a job as a nanny where I made $20 an hour.	If you like babies/kids - be a nanny! I did go to college for 5 semesters, but I dropped out due to finances. And because of that- my transcript has been on hold til I can pay 30k 🙃🙃🙃 I’m a full time nanny/housekeeper and I love it. I make between $15-16 an hour after taxes are taken out. I wish I made more and had a degree obviously, but I like what I do and live alone without trouble paying my bills. And living in the heart of Dallas with a fairly high cost of living, that’s saying something. IMO. Just throwin it out there ! :)	0
What are your thoughts on waiting for sex until marriage?	It's primarily something that naive children and overly religious people believe in, therefore not something that an adult woman who is compatible with me would believe in or want. I'm not going to waste time on a woman who insists upon that, especially once she's out of early adulthood and likely actually serious about sticking to her guns on the matter, rather than liable to say nuts to that after finally getting aroused and wanting to fuck someone.	It would be a non-starter for me but I wouldn't give you flak for it. Your body, your choices, your life.	0
What mind games have been attempted on you?	broke up with me because they weren't sure if they loved me then proceeded to get jealous and frustated when i started moving on and talking to new people	I “might” come over later ... After this happened several times seeing the pattern that around 7pm he’d say “can’t make it Now” - i realised it was to keep me inside and doing nothing. Total control. Ugh!	0
Do you feel like you have to appear as nonthreatening as possible?	Yeah. I'm big. If you're an average sized woman I'm massive. Throw in the beard and real wide shoulders, if I'm a little bit messy I see people cross streets to avoid me. In my winter coat with a watch cap I look exactly like a batman henchman - just a generically large mean person who probably does crimes. So, I try to speak softly. I say "Oh goodness!" when I hear a story about an outlandish circumstance, smile a lot, and am especially polite. This appears to put people at ease and make them more comfortable around me. I consider it a courtesy, just broadcasting that I'm a sweet person not a mean one.	I'm 173lbs, 5'10" and pure muscle. The only way I can be "unthreatening" is if I'm wearing a banana suit. Not doing that.	1
Older women: what is something that a lot of younger women on r/askwomen don't seem to understand?	This thread, and some of the responses, are ageist. Different people have different experiences, which defines who we are. And the perspective of a young person is no less valid than the experience of an older person. So to say that young people are immature, "don't have life figured out", or "will look back and cringe" is disrespectful and invalidating. I like the idea of this thread, but if think a better thread would be giving all women a chance to give the other women on here some general advice, regardless of age. But to ask "what don't younger women understand?" seems very ageist.	Patience really is a virtue. 22 year old me was never able to sit and wait for the outcome. I had to confront it! Deal with it! Fix it! Right Now! It's amazing how many things fix themselves. It's even more amazing simply acknowledging that maybe it simply isn't any of my business.	0

Women of Askmen, what do you look like (Summer 2017 edition)?	Holy shit, lurkers out in full force today. Not even talking about the women either: where did all the pathetic-ass "marry me pls" motherfuckers come from? Y'all know who you are, some of this shit was sad af to read. None of us like to be called 'creepy'; ***well don't be fucking creepy then.***	Holy shit, lurkers out in full force today.

What is something your SO once told you and it still pisses you off even thinking about it ?	"i will never love anyone more than i love my mom" he called and tried to take it back a few days later but the damage was already done.	My SO told me that he would have no problem breaking up with me if he met a girl who he thought would be better for him. I understand what he was trying to say, like he would break up with me before ever cheating on me but the way he said it really stuck with me. It made me insecure and jealous of whatever other girl he was interacting with. He's very particular about who he likes and even girls I know he'd never go for, I still felt that terrible feeling. He's no longer my SO. For that and a list of other reasons why I broke up with him.	0
Are you Team White/Gold or Team Blue/Black?	I don't understand how someone could see this the other way... How does this work? edit: I suspect this is just trolling, and certain users are in on the joke, and no one has spilled the beans yet. >___> edit #2: OH MY GOD, holy fuck! I just glanced away for awhile, saw the post of the blue dress someone else posted, and then glanced back at the OP, **and the dress was blue and black this time**. Though it quickly faded back to being white and gold. Try looking at a clearer picture of the dress, with OP's picture in your periphery. I can force myself to see the dress as blue if I do this.	Wait, some people see this as blue and black? That... freaks me out. Where's the black part? I really only see gold and white.	1
Men who have been left at the altar, what's your story?	My friend was left at the altar by this woman because her mom opposed the marriage (the dude doesn't make a lot of money) and she ended up letting him know the night before, leaving him to cancel everything and letting everyone know. There was no way of letting EVERYONE KNOW that the wedding was canceled so I printed out a most interesting man meme that read "I don't always cancel weddings, but when I do, I do it with a meme" and glued it to the door of the place where the reception was supposed to take place. I ended up just spending the night with him and another friend with some beer and a bottle of tequila. EDIT: to everyone asking it's worse than you think, they got married a year later and right now are going through a divorce. Unexpected I know.	She left me for her ex on our wedding day. Years later, her ex (now husband) writes a movie about the whole ordeal, making HIM look like the hero and ME look like the jackass bad guy in the red cowboy boots.	1
When you like a girl, what populates your thoughts about her?	I think about sappy couple shit. I'm currently crushing on a girl and I want to invite her over to build pillow forts and watch stupid 80s movies and eat cookies and fall asleep cuddling. I want to go IoA and Disney and parks and have a fairy tale romance. But I am a romantic in a big way about people I genuinely like. I'm getting a steady stream of sex from a FWB so I'm not concerned about sleeping with this girl I like. I'm more interested in the relationship itself.	Along with sex, I romanticize our entire future together. Introducing her to my friends, rainy days at home together, bringing her over for family stuff, fun dates, etc. I really wish I could stop because that just sets a very high expectation that usually lets me down, but I'm a romantic; what can I say?	0
Men, how long do you usually last in bed?	7-8 hours. Maybe closer to 10 hours on weekends, especially in the winter when it's so cold. I hate getting out from under my warm blankets. :(	I try to knock it out inside of 5 minutes. It gets hard though because it's so easy for me to last a long time. I found that if I got my wife on top of me, with her back towards me and her legs spread while I'm inside her, I can knock it out faster. It helps a lot if she comes once or twice. I like this position because it puts me in control of making her cum faster. The faster she can knock hers out, the faster I can knock mine out. If anything the real question should be how many times you can go in a day. On a perfect weekend I'd like to have a marathon and see who could have more orgasms. I think I could totally win at that one against my wife.	1
Ladies, how many of you are dating someone that's not your physically ideal man? Do they know? How does it make them feel?	Honestly, I was pretty meh about men with beards until I met my boyfriend. My tastes changed real fast. Also, dating my "ideal physical man" <<<<< dating a guy I'm attracted to on a number of levels. To sum up, dating my physical fantasy does not matter and has no real effect on my relationship.	My current bf is the first white guy i've ever dated. He always knows that he's not my "type". He also knows that I think he looks old (there's quite an age gap between us, and I look young for my age). I think he does feel conscious from time to time, but I've made it clear that although i don't think he is that good looking, I'm still hugely attracted to him physically. And he's pretty comfortable being who he is so it's not really a big deal. One time I teased him about his look and he said "Don't try too hard to make me feel unattractive. I'd hate to see you fail."	1
Guys, would you mind if a girl approached you in public and complimented your appearance?	Mind? It would make my fucking day. A girl complimented my shirt once and it left me on high for the rest of the day. Yes, definitely, go for it. Approach him in private, tell him you find him attractive and introduce yourself. It will go well, guaranteed.	Seeing as you think hes attractive...he prob is in general...so he wont be intimidated, and if it were me I would be attempting to plant a seed to Fuck you since your attraction is obvious	1
Shouldn't some sexual preferences be examined/questioned? Why do we treat preferences as some sort of sacred cow?	I get pretty frustrated with the amount of men who come into sex-positive, feminist spaces with a whole lot of unchecked male-privilege, and try to dominate the conversation with their ramblings about how proud and unashamed they are of their rape fantasies, and how "normal" and "natural" it is. Fuck you. I'm judging. That is not what sex-positivity is supposed to be about. You're not abnormal or disgusting as an individual for having them, but let's not be an idiot and pretwnd like our sexualities aren't constructed within a patriarchy and a rape culture. How DARE you come into a space that intrinsically attracts a lot of rape-survivors, and then misuse the space like that. That shit is TRIGGERING. The fact that so many men think rape is hot, is a DAMN PROBLEM.	There are sexual preferences that are normal. Being attracted to short/ tall people, small/big people, hair colour, eye colour whatever. Totally normal. Those are fair to be accepted and not judged, but there are two conditions. You cannot treat people you are attracted to better than people you are not attracted to. And, you cannot act like something that makes you attractive makes you better than someone else. That's where problems arise. Now, that being said, some other stuff can be judged. Children, animals are never OK. Not ever. These people should seek help and have help provided for them. Then there are grey areas. Submissiveness and dominance are both acceptable, but only in a consenting relationship with no other underlying issues. People who say that they're only attracted to submissive Asian girls are looking for someone they can take advantage of.	0
Is my job a turn off?	Guy here, if a woman you meet asks your profession just tell her it's a bit strange to most people and you don't like to talk about it until you know the person better. This will intrigue them, women love a bit of mystery. When you do tell them, don't be the least bit embarrassed, be proud of what you do and emphasis the emotional aspects rather than the technical. Assuming it's true, talk about wanting to help people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.	Best thing I can tell you is that it's not about the job, it's about your presentation. Think of it like a resume. You probably don't want to go around telling the girl you're dating how much ass it kicks to embalm corpses all day because she won't "get it." Just say, "actually, it's not that bad" and mention that it pays well or whatever. Try to ease her into it by not letting the subject stay up for too long at a time in the earlier points.	0
Have you been with someone older (7+) while in your teenages years? Did you regret it after growing up?	When you're 15 and dating an older guy, you feel like the coolest girl in the world. When you hit your 20s, you will realize just how creepy and weird that guy must have been.	Since some people want a bit more information on my situation : I am 15, he's 24. I'm not that worried about it, except of course for my parents reaction. He's more worried about it being wrong than I am. I also seem to see a lot of posts here agreeing with the fact I shouldn't be with him. I just have trouble understanding why. He really makes me feel happy. I just don't feel attracted by people my age, I find them too immature.	1
Do you shower in the morning or at night?	Both. I shower when i wake up, and i shower when i get home after the gym while my dinner is in the oven.	Morning, I want to be fresh for my friends and classmates. Whoever showers at night and goes to work or school in the morning without showering is a fucking monster and should be sent to Australia	1
When was the first time you had unprotected sex?	Good for most of y'all. I literally have never had sex with a condom. I lost my virginity at 13 and now I'm 21 with 20+ bodies. I know I'm stupid. Don't follow my step. It's a habit I'm actually trying to break now	Without a condom- my college girlfriend, around 21. She was on the pill. It was awesome. Life changing. Even though I had to really train myself not to finish in thirty seconds. Without any protection- hasn't happened yet, even though I have kids. But I'm getting a vasectomy this year, so my wife can have her IUD out next year. Looking forward to shooting blanks, especially because we had two sneak past the goalie already.	0
Men who were cheated on in a LTR, how long until you were able to trust someone in a relationship again (or were you unable to)?	Women cheat. Say it with me: women cheat. It's what they do, and it's unlikely that you'll find the exceedingly rare forever-faithful type. Don't let their infidelities affect your self-image. Keep future partners at a metaphorical arm's length--no cohabitating, joint finances, or ovum fertilization. You should know in the back of your mind that you can walk away from a relationship at any time with minimal cost. And don't let your relational status get in the way of getting yours.	I think it's one of those things, like your house getting hit by a tornado. You never feared it before because you didn't really think it could happen to you even though you know it's possible. After it happens even though you feel safe in your new house from day to day, storm clouds always bring dread of what may happen.	0
Ladies who mostly use pads during your period - why? And do your friends give you crap for it?	I only use pads. I like pads more than tampons. I don't feel gross or feel like I am wearing a diaper. The only shit I get for being a pad user is actually from 2XC comments.	I find it funny how American women seem to be obsessed with tampons. I'm not American and I've always used pads coz the idea of having something stuck inside me all day long is not very pleasing.	1
Is there anyone here who would say they are NOT ambitious?	Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. Fortunately, I also lack any ambition towards relationships, so it doesn't matter to me if other people find me boring.	Female here! I looked at the thread and a few comments, and based on a cursory glance, I don't think you lack ambition. Sure, you don't really want to move up the corporate ladder, but you've already secured a white collar job with a comfortable salary. When the women on the other thread talk about "lacking ambition", they seem to be talking about guys who work part-time on minimum wage, who are content to deliver pizza and smoke pot all day. Yes, you go to work and play video games and whatever, but I think what separates you and those guys is the job you already occupy.	1
Will you ever ditch your girl friend for your gf? Why or why not?	I don't disagree with the others but as soon as he said "I'm willing to hide it" I got a really bad vibe. Either he is aware that his relationship is bunk and he doesn't want to leave, or he knows being with you may cross some lines. I am ever the optimistic and well guess he is done with the relationship. But as soon as secret friends becomes a thing I get weirded out.	I stopped going out with my girl friends who happened to be fwbs, alone. Only in groups with my gf there. Or a really large group. Out of respect. They still come over to chill though. My gf is completely aware of how our cohort works, doesn't have a problem. (I vet for that in an s.o.)	1
How can you tell whether you're in love with someone or just in love with the idea of being in love?	I knew I was in love, when I wanted to marry this girl, but saw she was really happy with a different guy, so instead of trying to ruin their relationship, I was happy for her, and shoved away my pain, to see her happy.	You enjoy spending time with them now. You like their personality, characteristics and values as they are. You're not looking to change them or hoping some big gesture will magically improve everything. You're not forget waiting for the next step of commitment. I think in the most stable and healthy relationships, those big milestones are only affirmations of how you already feel and not an expectation of how you world feel.	0
How old are you and what is the biggest struggle in your life right now?	28 (29 in a month) here. Right now, it's that my husband and I have been not-trying (ie: not actively preventing) to get pregnant for two years now with no luck and it's really starting to wear on me. His younger sister just announced that she's having a baby in April. I'm happy for her but it also reminds me of how much I want it and how scared I am that I can't...	I am 61. I quit working several years ago to take care of my MIL until she died. Then took care of my own mother until she died. Now am stay at home housewife trying to find purpose and relevance for the next stage of my life. I have all the time in the world and no idea what to do with any of it. Not true- I have hobbies and things I enjoy doing. I'm just at a bit of a crossroads right now and having difficulty adjusting to not being needed as much any more. Husband is wonderful but I am alone a lot. First world problem to be sure.	0
What has your SO done recently to make you feel loved, appreciated and/or happy?	I got home from a long day at work and the first thing I did was to spill out my freshly filled glass of water. He wasn't too happy about that, but he cleaned it up for me while I wailed in a corner.	He ordered from my favorite take out without telling me so it just arrived to our door right when I was commenting about being hungry. Woke me up by kissing my back.	0
How would you feel about a female friend of yours asking you to be her casual date to a wedding?	Youre obviously hoping that he will read romance into the invitation here, I guess I would take it at face value though.	People do that sort of thing all the time. Just call him or shoot him a text asking if he wants to go with you. Edit: A word.	0
What exactly is progressive about letting your son wear a dress?	Does he identify as a female? I do think we are going full retard on the rejection of "gender roles".	Clothing is just fabric with the one logical purpose: protecting you from the elements. Every other purpose - fashion, in-group identification, etc. is subjective and remarkably arbitrary. In many cases, it's totally pointless. So a guy wearing a dress is fundamentally inconsequential whereas enforcing a "no men wear dresses" attitude perpetuates random social feelings. If you think about it, Greek togas and Japanese kimonos, typically worn by men and women both, are basically dresses. But nobody thinks twice (at least in ancient Greece or Japan) about a man in such attire because it conforms to their respective cultural contexts. tl;dr it's progressive because it fucks with cultural contexts	0
What do guys feel about eating out a girl?	Absolutely love it. I love giving my partner pleasure. I love the taste, the smell, everything. I've done all kinds of crazy stupid shit in the name of eating pussy. I once ate my ex out for the entirety of a movie, one of the first times I did it, just do find out what I was doing. Got her off in the end, and whenever we saw that movie playing we'd laugh. I went down on my ex so much that when I pulled up after finishing, it looked like she was bleeding. Turns out it was me. I had been down there so long and had been going so nuts that I cut my tongue or lip open without noticing. And of course, I'm fairly certain every decent pussy-eater has come up with his tongue/lips kinda numb. Sign of a good job.	Oh my god it's my favorite thing. My favorite is when it nearly turns into a goddamn MMA fight before she climaxes. I had a girl wrap her legs around my head, squeeze and then try to push my head away. I grabbed her hips, held my breath, and finished the damn job.	0
When Vasalgel becomes available for all consumers, will you prefer to use it or to continue using female-oriented birth control?	Sorry, but no fucking way am I injecting anything in my cock. My gf can use whatever BC she wants, that's fine with me. But I refuse to let a needle anywhere near my member.	I'd use both. Two forms of control is better than just one. Plus, I'm on birth control for medical reasons too.	0
Guys who's wives are still crazy over you, what's your secret?	I married a virgin. We also really liked each other as people from day one. And we talked for about 3 months every day before we became sexual. And I'm not a loser. I work through my problems, stay in great shape, admit when I'm wrong, and dont think I'm the shit.	He never stopped doing the small goofy stuff to make me smile. Last week, I turned on the ceiling fan and a bar of chocolate came sailing down from one of the blades. He gets super excited if he has a surprise for me, standing on his toes, and I know it's because he's excited for my reaction. He's always trying to make my life a little brighter, and it never fails to make my heart melt. And it's not just the fun stuff. If he sees me starting to do the dishes, he'll jump in to help without being asked.	0
Is anyone else kind of just... lost?	Do you know what you want? Why compare your life to your married friend's if you don't want to be having a kid right now? You're not in a terrible place at 25. You're fit, sociable (as you can be), you're probably doing better than you think. I know you've said you've looked for a new job in the city, but maybe you can find one elsewhere? If it's the schedule or demands of this job that you think are the problem, see if you can find a more stable/consistent one where you are now. Outside of that, try to stop comparing. Life isn't a competition unless you want it to be. You can be happy for your friends while being in a different place. Take things at your own speed - besides, it's not like everyone who's married at your age has everything figured out either.	Join the military. Seriously. Just a couple of years. You get a whole other perspective on life. Sure, it can be dangerous but at least you'll have buddies and a mission.	1
I called my SO's penis by accident, and I am mortified. Do you think this would affect him in any way?	Bring up in conversation: 'My friend (a friend of OP in case) said she was dating this guy with a small dick, so I told her I was so lucky to have you' Something like that. Wrap it up casually, he'll probably feel good both about you thinking he is good and others knowing it too.	His change of subject *may* be an indication that he did hear you, pretty much knows you didn't mean it *that* way, but still kind of bothered him despite knowing that because culturally such a deal is made of it for men, but this, but but that... Just avoid doing it again and casually compliment him to the opposite effect some time soon. Try not to make it too obvious or overdo it.	0
Tired of being a Nice Guy. What does it take to be a Good Guy?	In retrospect, I think that the nice guy problems that I had could have been largely prevented by not trying to make female friends. That just set me up for the problems described in Ladder Theory. Guys are for friends. Women are for dating. Keep the boundaries clear. If I fall for a female friend, I'm almost inevitably friendzoning myself. Also: be you. Maybe that's being a nice guy--polite, kind, and respectful. Embrace who you are and accept that a whole lot of women will have zero interest in you but prefer men that you regard as jerks or otherwise your social inferiors. Be who you are and let other people--including women that you find attractive--be who they are. Don't concern yourself with the values of other people, let alone get upset about them.	> I joined r/niceguys to try and identify nice guy behavior in myself and cure it if I can **but no one really gives advice on what to do, just what not to do.** Let me reveal the truth to you then, young grasshopper. What you must do, without fail, is to find self-love and self-confidence. To find self-love, you must find yourself believably attractive. To find yourself believably attractive, you must have positive, interesting qualities. To have positive, interesting qualities, you must have genuine interests and emotions that do not gravitate around yourself and your resentment. To have interests and emotions that do not gravitate around resentment, you must learn not to blame others for your failures. To not blame others for your failures, you must learn to appreciate errors. At that point, the young student attained great enlightenment.	0
Which "signs that a girl likes you" are absolute horseshit?	Blow jobs. Just cause she blows you doesn't mean she likes you. She could be bored or just a pity blow.	Eye contact. I understand it to an extent but I don't think anyone should rely heavily on that as a sign. If people are comfortable in a conversation generally there is eye contact.	0
Men with disabilities, how does your disability affect your dating life?	My left ear is deaf. I feel stupid always having to ask girls to repeat themselves. So a lot of time i just smile and nod, or laugh when they do and have no fucking idea whats going on. I once asked a girl if she wanted to meet me at a bar. No idea what she said. So i just said cool and went about my way. Then went there and waited to see if she was showing up or not.	Somehow, being short seems a little less unpleasant after reading these comments, even though I haven't had a "date" in more than thirty years.	1
How do you get yourself to doing things that would be beneficial in your life if done but scare you?	Disclaimer: Man Here. Fear breeds more fear... if it'll put you in a better place, do it. This life move might only put you in a slightly better place, for now.... but if you dont go through with it, that fear will be instilled deep within. So the next life move that comes up, might put you in a hugely better place... but you'll pass on it because you're afraid, and used to being afraid. Written like hell, but you'll get the jist. Be a fearless f&%*er	I get other people involved. I suck at keeping commitments to myself, but I always keep my commitments with others.	0
Is it rude to presume a gift will be given at a Renewal of Vows, and to specifically ask for cash because you "have it all"?	I'll repost my answer... I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People have birthdays every year and other still tend to buy them presents... So I don't think expecting that some people would give "second wedding" gifts.	Yes. Super presumptuous. I would not in a million years bring a gift to a vow renewal, and the assumption of getting one would be insane to me. I can see certain guests bringing them because hey, event, let's be nice to our friends, but.. to assume that everyone's gonna bring one and hey actually guys, just money will do? That is some *craziness*.	0
I've been thinking about having an IUD put in. If you've had one put in, what have your experiences been like, and what can I expect?	Mine was great for two years. Then something happened and we never figured out what, but I was cramped over in lots of pain. It got worse and worse for weeks until I could hardly walk. I had tons of tests run with no answers. I asked my OB if there was any chance it might be the IUD and he said maybe, we could remove it and see if it helped. Day after removal all the pain was gone. Would not get an IUD again personally, but I know they work well for many.	I loved mine!! I wanted to be off hormones so I asked for the copper one. It hurt like crazy being put in and also I had this really weird stress/emotional/pain/invasive thing reaction where I cried for like ten minutes afterwards. BUT since then I feel literally nothing, I basically never need to think about it, and it works.	0
Men, how do you feel about receiving racy pics from women you don't know well?	I'd prolly be pretty suspicious or figure it was a mistake. As for dudes sending unsolicited dick pics, I figure it's a high risk high reward type thing.	You would be hard pressed to convince me to send a dick pic. I like to think most guys wouldn't do it unless pressured. But, then there are douches like that that probably think it turns you on enough to give him a chance. I dunno what the thought process is when sending an unsolicited dick pic....	0
Adult Men/Dads, How do you handle it all without going insane?	Plan everything. Try "outsourcing" as much things as you can - hire a cleaning lady, hire someone to do yard work, don't fix the car yourself take it to the mechanic, etc. When I stopped doing shit myself it was magic. I lost out on some money, but I gained a ton of time that just didn't exist before.	Its funny you mention Ukraine and Isis. I live in Israel. This past summer was wild. I live close to Syria and Lebanon and Hizbollah is threatening to start war in the North soon. Im in rocket range. We have gas masks in case of a chemical attack. But me and my wife are pretty chilled about the whole situation. We trust in God. It sort of comes with living in Israel. i was also in Ukraine 2 weeks ago and nothing happened to me. Just chill. Besides that - i pray, meditate,smoke cigarettes and makes lots of music. edit- why downvotes?	1
How do you feel about period sex?	With my girlfriend? No problem, might just use a condom to keep my willy clean. With a random girl from the bar? That's an other story.	FUCK YEAH!!! Is how i feel about it. My girlfriend doesn't use any contraceptives. We use condoms, of course. But come period time it is bareback and come inside that's on the menu. I have a hard time containing my excitement that time of month. And yes i am aware of the risk we are still taking. If we have kids now, while taking this risk now, we'll just have to deal with it.	1
What on Earth do y'all do with your stuff ( like keys, phone, wallet) at a club?	When I used to go to the bar I ran a tab. I carried in my card and handed it to the bartender, then all I had to do was keep up with my car key because I kept everything else in my car. Then I'd wear my key like an ankle bracelet on a budgee type cord.	My technique definitely isn't best, but I usually use my bra. Debit card slid under one armpit, phone under the other (screen side out to avoid sweat getting under the glass) and then I normally have my normal bag with my keys, flat shoes and other stuff in which I will put in the cloakroom (I assume these are also a thing in the US?). Or, alternatively, take a guy and utilize his pockets and treat him like a bag. No shame. Though regardless of where everything else is, my phone will always be in my bra. My phone and I are very attached to each other and I get vaguely panicky if it's not in my immediate surroundings, especially if I'm drunk.	0
Ladies, what's something you've stopped telling people because you're tired of the way they respond?	I hate mentioning eating healthy and exercising. People automatically respond with "You're not fat why would you do all that?" First, I never said I was (5'1 100lbs) second, I just want to be a healthier person! I have zero muscle in my body and get tired from physical activity very easily so I just want to better myself.	I generally don't bring up that I'm pro-life. It's my personal beliefs, it's not a judgement on other people, and I don't want to fight about my faith. I get how separation of church and state works, if we don't agree on when a fetus is alive it's a pointless discussion...	1
How do you convince someone they're attractive when they have zero self esteem?	Most likely they have zero self-esteem is because of their past experiences that reinforce the idea that they're ugly. The best way to counter this is to create new experiences with them that reinforce the idea that they're attractive. The more powerful the experience, the better. That's why actions are generally more powerful than words. When I was little my mom once told me that she wished that she married a white guy instead of my Asian dad and said that I was a disappointment because I reminded her of her Asian heritage. I repeat what she said to myself every night before bed. So yeah like I said, the more powerful the experience, the better.	Seeing that confidence is the most attractive trait in a guy...he's not attractive if he has zero self-esteem. You can convince him that he's attractive *to you* though.	1
What was your most recent frustration with a woman?	I know this is actually the opposite of what should be said in this thread. But I can't remember my last frustration with a woman. My girlfriend is pretty amazing :)	Ugh. She liked me enough to let me catch her if I chased hard enough, but not so much that she'd do any of the moving herself. Fuck that noise. It sucks, because she was cool as hell. Fun to hang out with. But I can't be the one doing everything all the time, you know?	0
Is there something you thought made a person more attractive, but then when actually experiencing it you realized you didn't like it?	First, to the OP: thanks for making it *person* not *guy.* My answer? Not wealth as in money, but, like, "uppity" for lack of better term. Turns out, I'm podunk as fuck and if I can't wear jeans to it, I don't really wanna go. I tried dating an 'east coaster' that liked to go to Polo matches and Broadway plays. Just... not my cup of tea	For lack of a better term, intellectualism? I used to think I was really attracted to well-read, "cultured" people who could wax poetic about, well, poetry. And art, music, etc. Oh man I was wrong, there is nothing more boring than dating a smart person who wants to talk at you like they're defending their thesis. Don't get me wrong, the people I date are still intelligent, but they're also *interesting* and good at socializing and can make and appreciate lame jokes and read trashy novels and fanfiction with me.	0
What’s your holy grail when it comes to treating acne scarring/dark spots/dull skin?	aha (alpha hydroxy acid) serum. there are lots of different options, the one i use is pretty expensive (drunk elephant tlc framboos) but i haven't found one that works nearly as well on my skin	Loads of fruits, veggies, and water. Stay away from fried foods and touching your face. Wash your face regularly, but don’t dry it out.	1
What's the difference between the girl you fuck and the girl you date?	The girl who fucks outside of a relationship (aka has FWB or fuck buddies) is not the girl I want a relationship with.	1. Guys (the ones interested in casual sex in the first place) tend to have lower standards for casual sex than they do for relationships, so attractiveness is one reason a girl might only be considered as a casual sex partner and not as a romantic option. 2. It's possible to have plenty of sexual interest in a girl but not want to date her due to personal incompatibilities, or a lack of romantic attraction. Even if the people spend time together fine in the context of a friend(s-with-benefits-)ship, there can still be personal incompatibilities that make the guy not think that a long-term committed relationship would work. 2. Sometimes a guy is at a point in his life where he's not looking for a relationship. It's a common excuse, but sometimes it's true. 3. Many guys specifically aren't interested in turning a casual sex arrangement into a relationship.	0
What are some funny/cringy things you've had said to you by a customer at your job?	Older guys keep hiring on me. One of the common ways is asking me over to cook. My answer is to just laugh and tell them if they want a date with me, they're the ones that need to cook me dinner. Gets a chuckle every time. But, really, my boyfriend does most of the cooking. I'm a modern woman.	A couple years ago, I worked at Chick-Fil-A. One day, this lady pulled up in the drive-thru and before I could even get out the usual "hi how are you" she asks me "do you hate gay people?" Apparently she thought that since the founder of CFA was against gay marriage, everyone who worked there must hate gay people. Even after explaining that's not true, she proceeded to say she just can't support a company like that but then gives me her card to pay for her food. It was weird.	0
Can you tell me about your best friend?	He lived in the dorm room next door to me freshman year. We were very different people. I was a nerdy fat kid studying engineering and he was running track at our school and studying Political science. I went to prom alone, he was the prom king. However I stuck around (initially probably because all the ladies liked him) and he was never a dick to me. He didn't make me the butt of jokes and over time we became friends. That was 11 years ago, earlier this year he got married and I was his best man. Really good dude.	Day 1 of college, this nerdy fella came up and asked if I like to drink. 7 years later, we have nothing in common but our love of alcohol. He's the best man in my wedding.	1
What is the most unusual kink that someone you dated revealed to you?	My girlfriend had kind of an odd fixation on lactation for a while. Did all kinds of stuff like take herbal supplements and changed her diet to try to cause her to lactate without getting pregnant. Never worked and she eventually dropped it.	Had a girlfriend constantly asking to peg me. I told her to fuck off and she wasn't happy so we ended that shit then and there.	1
How do you cope with being legitimately unattractive?	I just... "deal with it". Life is too short to stress about things I can't change. I realized I wasn't conventionally attractive in middle school and immediately worked hard on my personality. It has done me wonders! I put a lot more pride in my intelligence and accomplishments than by how much attention I get.	There's a flip side to that coin. How do people cope when they are legitimately attractive. Many become insecure because they feel they are successful because of looks rather than on competence. Many become obsessed about losing their looks as they age. Many won't get the job they want simply because they are too attractive. Many lose their looks as they age and will have no compensating qualities to fall back on. Many are in many relationships but none of them are meaningful - quantity does not mean quality. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - despite being attractive - you're not attractive to everyone. Many are treated differently because of their looks which is not always a good thing. Beauty fades but dumb is forever. Being attractive is not all it's cracked up to be.	1
People who grew up in a "bad neighborhood. How aware were you as a child that you lived in a bad neighborhood?	Undercover cops were parked in front of my house a lot for years until my neighbors were finally arrested. I wasn’t allowed down the street alone, ever. My older brother walked me places with a bat or golf club. My neighborhood had a curfew. I was a little aware, but not really. Not until friends from school started to come over and comment.	I was aware that we lived in a bad neighborhood when a guy died right in front of our house and the cops came by to knock on the door to ask if we had seen anything. We weren't home at the time that he died, but I was about 8 or 9 when this happened.	1
How do you handle the "what are you looking for?" question when a girl asks it early on?	Never ever ever answer this question in a straight-forward manner. You *always* have to deflect this. Any definitive answer removes the mystery and she'll lose interest. You have to be vague and charming, but not dismissive. The key is to get her hamster running and create/increase the sense of mystery about you. I promise, if you leave it open-ended, she won't run away, but be intrigued. You need to go with this: "What do you want? What are you looking for?" Then you answer some version of "I'm looking for new exciting experiences. And I'm looking for company to experience whatever life has to offer." It's good. Suitably vague, but positive. And doesn't answer "girlfriend/ltr/fwb/wife." If she presses you, "What does that mean?" You answer, "What I just said: somebody to experience life's adventures with." She'll fill in the blanks with whatever she wants.	I'm a monogamy fan so I would always say "I would like to take this seriously, and take it as long as we can." "As of now I don't see this having a defined end, so I want to continue that trajectory". Last time I said that was 10 years ago last night. So far seems the trajectory has maintained it's overall direction.	0
I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts?	> I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts? You want my advice? Don't. Your acquaintance is an ass, whatever. Just keep up your shit and let him rot.	No no no! Rejection is NOT a bad thing. It's almost a good thing. Even though it would be nice to snag every girl you see out there, rejection should give you the motivation to keep going. You should treat it with the lowest amount of fucks possible. Oh she rejected me? That's cute, hey look, there's an even more beautiful girl across the room from me. Rejection can save you a lot of time and heartbreak down the road too if the girl turns out to be really incompatible even in your first interaction. You have to change your perspective, it should be almost funny, the worse of a rejection they give you, the more entertained you should be by it. You gotta think you deserve every girl out there, and your friends are the losers for not having the balls to do approaches of their own!	1
Any of you in your 20's or up and don't have a drivers license if so why and how's it affecting you?	20 here. I tell people it's because I like speeding and I'd rather solve the problem at the source than control myself. I also don't trust people on the street, I hate red lights and a car brings a lot of problems (parking places, red lights, other assholes driving, etc). True reason is, I've never had the money to pay for the driving lessons nor the time for it. My dream is to drive a motorcycle.	20 YO, no license. I'm from NYC, so I never really felt the need to drive. Sure, it'll cut my travel time, but the train works just fine for now. And I don't have to worry about parking.	0
What's something you saw coming from miles away that other people didn't?	onlyfans shutting down pornography on its platform after it reached a certain level of prominence. paypal and patreon both did something very similar.	I’m into astrology and I love paying attention to upcoming transits and for 2020 I saw that there was going to be an event that resulted in a lot of deaths and sure enough the pandemic hit	1

Fellow single men, what’s a dating dealbreaker that significantly reduces the dating pool for you?	No kids and not fat. Child free because I want to share that moment together. Fat is disgusting and a sign that they're a generally bad person. Of course those are dating standards. Fucking standards are wide open.	Someone who can talk to me and be super into what they're talking about. Vague I know But so many times you date a girl and ask her what her hobbies are or what she does in her spare time and the answer is always "just chill out" or "eat". So like when you're on your own you just sort of sit in your apartment doing nothing? Feels like they're just piggy backing off my interests and not bringing anything of their own to the relationship	0
How would you positively teach resilience and strength to young men, without falling into the trap of the "never show weakness, suck it up" mentality?	i grew up with that "be strong, don't be weak" approach that OP mentions. It is a bad mindset to have. But I managed to turn it into an embrace of stoicism. It's not bad to process your feelings yourself or to take time to think through things and solve your own problems as best you can. It means you are available to help others. I guess I'd try to pass on the stoic approach	Resilience and strength are not necessarily taught, rather formed in the face of adverse circumstances. The only reason I'm resilient and strong is because I had to be to make it on my own, and those qualities were byproducts of working hard to move forward in life. The best way to teach these qualities is through example.	0
A random topic came up last night about Male Rape and my group of friends thought it was a joke and non-relevant. Has any other guy actually experienced this?	I think you would have to be delusional to not believe that rape is more biased towards women than men. That does not mean we should be dismissive when it does happen to men but distorting reality is not the way to solve problems.	I like how in these discussions, they assume the man is being raped by a woman. If you brought up prison rape, or a man raping another man, everyone would agree because "men can only rape." A good friend of mine was raped when he was younger. An older (female) teenager performed oral sex on him without his consent. It sounds ridiculous, even to me, but hearing him talk about it - it was totally sexual abuse. He didn't want it at all and she said she would tell others he raped her if he said no.	0
So I now have TWO IUD'S because my doctor didn't take mine out before she put the new one in... What's the most wtf medical appointment you've had?	Nothing quite as traumatic here but the Dr googled what dosage I should be on for one medication. And another gave me enough painkillers to either kill me or set me up as a drug dealer. Seriously. It's like two years later and I'm still finding them.	I was once told that my pinky finger needed to be amputated. I had gone in to talk to the doctor about pains in my ribs. He had the wrong patient chart.	0
Are there any traits you think men tend to undervalue when looking for a date?	Someone you actually like and get along with early on It seems like so many dudes want a girlfriend so badly they would rather date whoever will go out with them rather than trying to date women they really enjoy spending time with. And then wonder a month later once they get to know the person, why they are incompatible. Don't try to find "a girlfriend." Don't be generic and look for someone to fill a role. Try to find a woman you want to bring into your life rather than any person who will fill the role.	A woman who is genuinely a happy person, with a positive outlook on life. I've been with too many depressing women who take everything too seriously...	1
What are some common advice that women give to men which are actually statistically unlikely to yield positive results?	The ole' "do the laundry and get more sex." You get sex by turning her on, not feminizing yourself or being a doormat.	"You have to stop looking; I promise that the perfect girl with come to you eventually." The promise/guarantee is what makes it so ridiculously absurd	0
What's the best way an SO has ever woken you up?	A gentle handjob until I was rock hard and just a little awake and then guiding me into her. Various partners have tried waking me up with head, but it never works out - all the moving around to get mouth to cock access always wakes me up.	I was just barely awake and her first words to me were "I'm so horny, I want you so bad." Made her wait till I ate breakfast cause I can't do any of that on an empty stomach.	1
How do you really get over someone?	There are no cheats. Time heals all. Perspective. If you have a habit of checking how they are doing - break it. No contact is the tried and trusted method, if that’s not possible, be cordial.	time. i ended up everything with my ex one year ago and i closed full contact. 1 week ago she was in my town and needed to give me a bag so we went and had dinner together as friends. she has a cute thing that is calling me by my name when shes about to ask me something silly, and she would make this sweet voice and laugh. she did it at dinner to ask me to drive my car, and last year i would melt and love that little smile... 2 weeks ago i felt nothing, that's how i knew i was over her :) also we went to my house so she could meet my new cat and had sex twice but after that we remained friends and i know i dont love her anymore lol	1
Women who’ve dated a “loser,” what made your ex a loser and what did you learn?	When I was 19 I was craving a major adventure (35f, now). I ended up on a remote island in northern Canada and lived in the woods off-grid. The guy I dated while there (2 years, ish) was such a loser. Like was 31 at the time I met him, so 12 years older than me. Had never finished high school. Did odd jobs for money. Was pretty bizarre looking, freakishly tall and skinny. He was a smart guy and incredible reader but really into conspiracy theories. Loved Coast to Coast AM and listened to it religiously. Was weirdly attached to his mother. Looking back, it’s just one huge cringe. I learned that I deserve better than that!	He would always say he wished he could afford to take me out on a nice date blah blah blah. He gets paid, we’re on our way to a sports bar (I’m buying) but he has to stop by his dealers house real quick to spend $100 on an ounce of weed. That was over ten years ago and I still have moments of “WTF was I thinking?” EDIT: We were on and off for a while - he broke up with me when I no longer had a car and he also cheated on me - this memory sums up the entire relationship.	0
Ladies, does your butt hole get itchy?	Yes. I take toilet paper from work and it's pretty rough, plus i often poop more than once in a morning, depending on if coffee was had or if I'm eating tons more veggies than usual. If i don't cleanse my cornhole with some kind of moistened towelette before going out it will almost undoubtedly get real itchy. I should probably just buy toilet paper, it's not worth it anymore, having to put up with all this cornhole business.	All the time!!!! Edit: I decided to google it and apparently it's because I use wet wipes every time I go #2 to try and prevent the frequent UTIs I used to have. The chemicals in the wipes can dry you out and cause itching. The more you know... Edit 2: My first top comment on a thread is about my butt hole. Would you look at that.	0
Found Tinder running on my BF's phone. How should I handle this?	How about "So, I'm worried about something I saw on your phone when I was killing the GPS app... I found Tinder. What do you with that app? Do I need to be concerned with anything?" I guess knowing how long you have been dating might help context a bit.	Check his messages and see if any are current. Sometimes people just forget about it, or they just like to see who is interested in them. I have since deleted my dating apps since "being taken off the market"	1
Gentlemen. Your 15yr old daughter comes to you and says, "I want to get dates and have a boyfriend. How do I get boys to like me"? What do you tell her?	I have a 14 year old that turns 15 in roughly a month. We've had this conversation, and I tell her that she is not to "get boys to like her", she is to be herself, which she does. The boys will either like her or not. I tell her not to change who she is for anyone, she's smart, funny, beautiful, strong, athletic (she's on the volleyball team and plays travel volleyball as well). If she changes and puts on a "show" for a boy, then he's not interested in who she REALLY is, and that person, the girl she REALLY is has value, is an important person, and not someone that has to change to please anyone. That's what I tell her. :-)	I'll be honest with her, all she has to do is look good and the boys will come to her.	1
What regrettable/cringeworthy thing have you done to be the "cool" girlfriend/wife?	My ex had a female writing partner, which I was genuinely cool with. However, I then continued to be "cool" as I slowly realized that a) most of what they "wrote" together was essentially roleplay sex scenes and b) she was crazy jealous of me. I never questioned him about essentially having cybersex with this woman regularly - as well as a few other women - because I felt like since this was something he wanted and I didn't want to do it, I should let him get it elsewhere. But it did wind up effecting our sex life in a negative way, and my sexuality and self image as a whole.	Not sure what that means? I think I'm going to need some examples because right now, I am interpreting this as pretending to be "cool" with things I'm definitely not okay with just to be perceived as acceptable by others? ...and I just don't roll that way.	1
What non-sexual thing do you wish you had experienced sooner because you enjoyed it so much when it finally happened?	Working out. I never actually hit the gym until I was in my early 20's. The feeling you get from working out, the confidence, the feel-good endorphins, just everything has been so amazing. I wish I started earlier.	Trying cocaine. Did it first at 19, was pissed I wasted so many years not knowing how amazing the sensation was.	1
Folks who live in "cool cities," what's something most people don't know about it?	After you pay your rent, you won't have any money left to eat in these cool restaurants, go to cool events or be cool in general.	Wtf Is a cool city? Is Melbourne a cool city, I think the stereotype is that we’re a war between the latte sipping hipsters and the meat pie smashing footy nuts with two sets of teeth between them. Which tbh is mostly true. Only thing they miss is our huge Greek and Italian population.	1
What are some tactics you've used for dealing with some of the more subtle forms of workplace sexism?	I work in an IT department. It's primarily male Engineers, I am the only Communication major and the only woman. I am capable of fixing and handling just as many of the problems that come into our office as the men are. However, for some reason my boss only ever asks me to "tidy the office" or "organize a bit" while the men are allowed to continue working on whatever IT related problem they're dealing with. Lately when I've been asked to "tidy up" I just say, "oh you know, I think Jim is free right now" or joke, "It's Andrew's turn to do the dishes!" Slowly but surely it's been starting to work.	Quit my job in business to pursue something more radically feminist. I should say eventually quit my job in business and I'm roughly 3/4 of the way to being a midwife.	1
Who is a woman that you admire and why?	Shirley Curry. She's over 80 years old and has her own Youtube gaming channel. She got a lot of nasty comments when she first started out, but she dealt with it by being her own kind, wholesome self. Now she has a great fanbase that calls her "grandma", and she calls them "grandkids".	Oprah. In addition to her obvious massive success, I think she had a tough upbringing if I'm remembering the right wikipedia profile. More importantly, I find it fascinating that to this day, not everything she does is a success. Even Oprah makes duds. But she is wildly successful and popular because she doesn't let failure stop her from trying.	1
Any women out there raised by single dads? How do you feel this affected your connection to femininity?	Not single dad, but being the only girl between two brothers made me less girly, but in a weird way. I am a MUA, I like fashion but I used to hate pink ( I love it now) . I still struggle to connect with other woman because I don't like when they get whiny at stuff. This video is making an analysis about Stephanie Meyer, but talks about mysogin stuff I relate A LOT because I just loved Buffy and hated Twilight and it's fans so much! https://youtu.be/8O06tMbIKh0	I was. And I'm not sure that it had any affect, tbh. He gave us a wide birth to do pretty much whatever we wanted, and didn't press gender roles or performative femininity on us.	0
Is it irrational to not let my man do any sexual stuff with me when family are in the house?	You are perfectly ok with setting boundaries like this. You just need to be straightforward with him. Literally tell him "I'm not comfortable doing this with other people in the house." He may be frustrated because you have done it before. So you might need to find some other outlet for sex besides "Let's just hang out platonically unless our family isn't home." I would find it frustrating having an up-in-the-air sex life like that. I'm not sure what that solution is or what your options are in that regard.	Yeah, it is pretty irrational. Your parents have sex when you are in the house. Unless they have made a rule saying you can't have sex in their house then I don't see what the problem is. At a party I was hosting last year I slunk off upstairs with a girl and about halfway through the act my father opened the door to kick whomever was in my room out, noticed it was me, chuckled and shut the door again.	1
What's the worst/best pun/dad joke you know?	What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot. I told that joke and my dad thought it was **hilarious**. Edit: I've been a dad myself for 9 years and my best rated comment is now a dad joke.	Slightly NSFW: Did you hear about the man who performed oral sex on himself and exploded? I guess you can say he, *blew himself to pieces*.	1
Married women of AW, what are the hardest/toughest parts of marriage?	* In-laws * Children * Division of household labor / chores * One partner getting laid off / unemployed for a long time * Budgeting finances * One partner getting a job offer in a different state / country * Coping with physical / mental health issues * Agreeing upon parenting styles	The toughest part for me is only getting to have sex with one man for the rest of my life. I suppose I could cheat, but that involves effort and lying and I just don't have the time or the patience to deal with potential drama. I do have an excellent vibrator though, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.	1
How do you deal with a friend who is constantly coming to you about their toxic “situationship” but won’t leave them?	You have two options. 1. You tell them you can't handle it anymore and the conversation needs to stop and possibly go low/no contact. Or 2. You provide help and support where you can. You encourage them to be more independent, to be strong, to take care of themselves with the hope that when they're strong enough they will make a better decision.	I become pretty distant and have no emotion when they bring up the same thing. Or in some cases I Left the friend. Once to three times is fine. I get it takes time to disconnect from a person But any more than that is just finding an excuse to complain and do nothing about it because at the end of the day they choose it Toxic venting is a thing and I won’t have it near me.	1
What is your destination for the trip of your dreams, and why?	My destination is my bed and my dreams that involve an orgy with Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, All the Chris's minus Pine, Scarlett Johansson and AppleBach McGillersash.	New Zealand to see all the filming locations from Lord of the rings! SO and I started dating due to our mutual interest in it and we're both huge fans. Trying to convince him for a cheap wedding and NZ honeymoon.	0
What "grass looks greener over there" decision did you end up regretting?	Reconnected with a guy whom was not even in my friend group in high school, on fb. After some time, ended up hooking up and my SO of 5 years asked me point blank if i was cheating on him a few days afterwards. I told him the truth and we ended up breaking up. He was emotionally unstable and took his own life less than a week later. Since then my life has been a downward spiral. I will never forgive myself or be able to get past what I have done. The grass is definitely not greener. I’d give anything to get back what I had. But I know I don’t deserve him. I’m toxic and tortured with guilt and shame. Everything has changed.	Leaving a job, city, home, hobbies, life that I was happy with for a "better" role. It just didn't go over well. I was making more money, but I had been significantly happier before.	0
What is the biggest criticism or annoyance you have about someone but can't tell them either because it's not your business or because it'd be inappropriate?	I have a coworker who is sickeningly sexist both to men and women. It is damaging her career and she seems to think her deep understanding of the genders makes her stronger instead of disliked by many. I don't tell her cause she wouldn't listen anyway so what's the point.	If you want guys to stop thinking you're into them and trying to get in your pants, then I would highly suggest you s*top blatantly hitting on them and flirting like a fourteen year old!!!!* I'm a little tense.	1
What was the dumbest reason a girl gave you for not wanting to date you or when breaking up with you?	I was this girl: he had a toothpick habit and that’s what I told him when I broke up with him. I mean he carried them around everywhere and picked his teeth at the table. Legit nicest dude I have ever dated. Funny, smart, sweet, decent earner, had a great family and probably would have made an excellent partner and co-parent. All around everything a girl could ask for. But I could not get past the toothpicks and the vision of my future of picking up these wet tiny pieces of wood all over the house.	High school era...I dated a girl for two weeks. She dumped me because I didn't pay enough attention to her. Problem was, she didn't tell me we were dating. I said maybe 5 words to her at some party, and have never seen her since. Her friend told me. I had no idea what she was talking about, and didn't even know my new ex's name yet.	0
Folks who've dated someone with ADHD, how did it impact your relationship?	As a man with ADHD who feels great shame every time he forgets one of the issues generally talked about here (usually "chores") etc and works really hard to curb all the other ways it pops up that could be seen as disrespectful, this is really disheartening and a little condescending. We aren't children	I feel like I parented him and it made me anxious as I always worried how impulsive he would be or if my needs and wants were actually being heard. If anything was wrong, it would be completely ignored and it would treated as unnatural if I wasn’t in a good mood within seconds, and he couldn’t wrap his head around it. I assume he’s a fixer. He dumped me because he couldn’t handle my low points and said it made him anxious. I’m still very much feeling the aftermath of it.	0
Ladies, is there an ex that just won't leave you alone?	my first boyfriend. i broke up with him ten years ago, it was far from an amicable breakup, and he still contacts me. for a while i thought [hoped?] he made another suicide attempt and was successful, because i didn't hear from him for a couple years. but he wished me a happy birthday a couple months ago.	My ex wrote a book about me. A literal fucking book. Talk about not leaving you alone, *I get to walk into bookstores and see this shit*. I hope this makes you feel marginally better.	0
What do you think of Creedence Clearwater Revival?	They're one of my go-to bands to play at social gatherings. Like, how can you have a bad time listening to CCR?	Eh. I'm sure there are ccr songs I would like, but it just always seemed kind lame. Never really given them a chance though, so who knows.	1
I'd like to begin practicing martial arts. Which one would you suggest?	the styles that've been shown to be most effective are: * BJJ * wrestling * muay thai * boxing * kick boxing you're likely to be wasting your money and/or learning choreography doing anything else i do bjj and have done a little muay thai, a little kick boxing, and did kali/eskrima in my teen years. but don't take my word for it. take a trained killer's opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGpDVCkhtD4 edit: wording	Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I've tried a couple of martial arts and that's the one that stuck. I have been training for 7 years now.	0
What's the most "unmanly" thing you do?	I'm a man. If I do it, it's by definition "manly." And that includes having tea parties with a toddler and helping her put a bonnet on her beloved Pooh Bear.	I'm really surprised no one has said "Your Mom" since technically, she isn't manly... unless she's a butch dike or a post op...	1
When it comes to dating, what do you think is the biggest misconception men have about what it's like to be a single woman?	The " Why are you not in a relationship?! You're great!" *women don't have to be in a relationship throughout their lives* Some are single because they *wanna* be.	That we have orbiting men around us all the time and that we aren't rejected. My friends have had men 'ghost' on them frequently after what they felt was a great, successful date. This ignores women who appear unapproachable, unattractive women, or even average/attractive women who aren't social butterflies.	0
What's the weirdest thing your pet does?	My dog is not a morning person. So while I'm in the shower in the morning he will sad sing at me. "Arwoooo" "woooooowooooowoooo" Just sad songs. [He hates getting up lol](https://i.imgur.com/AST40zP.jpg). Bonus: [A photo of him not in the bathroom being a sad bum](https://i.imgur.com/7GHnXRe.jpg)	When I was little, I had a hamster who would try to run on the top of its wheel. Turned out it was aware of how to get out of its cage on paper, and was working to put it into practice. Eventually, it did. Got out of its cage and then broke its back falling off the dresser. But hey, he died free. That hamster's name? Harry. Harry Houdini.	1
Why does it appear that many parents were much more successful than their adult children of the same age?	Simply because things were easier for them back then. My grandad was a engineer for Rolls Royce, he got the job simply by walking up to the factory and asking if he could have a job, and they gave him a low end job which he then worked his way up from... These days grades seemingly mean everything, although my current job is very well paid and I wasn't even asked if I could spell my name.	At 23 your parents parents said the same thing to them. And their parents the same, etc etc. However, whining about it certainly makes you come off less adultish.	1
What suprised you about women's bodies?	How shit periods are. I’ve said I would like to experience what it’s like to have a period but honestly I don’t think it’s worth it. My girlfriend doesn’t complain about it but she gets sore boobs before, gets bloated, gets cramps, has sore boobs after, plus the actual blood, the pads, fear of drips, cleaning up, period poos. Then there’s the pretending like nothing’s wrong when I know she is in agony, for instance at social gatherings that are unavoidable or planned months in advance.	Hste to sound arrogant, how quickly they get wet and orgasm, for me it was harder to get off. The media paints it like all men premature ejaculate and all women are hard to satisfy. I was fucking girls so hard they were passing out from pleasure. I dont even have a big dick. Its adverage. Lick the clit, rub the roof of the pussy on the g spost and alternate that with deep thrusts of your fingers. Providing to have a slowly increasing rythm they will cum. Easy as that. I was amazed at how connected they were with it to...amazing watching a woman in extacy and knowimg you creating it. Makes you feel likethe man..lol.	1
What's your favorite part of Disney's "Mulan"?	Dude fuck Mulan. I had nightmares for months after seeing that movie. They make the Huns way too scary man.	The juxtaposition between the ending of "A girl worth fighting for" and seeing the razed village with the doll. Chills.	0
Ladies who read the label before buying a product: what ingredients/substances, both in food and cosmetics, do you refuse to buy?	I can't eat MSG, artificial colors, or almonds. Other than that I aim to keep me carb count low, I'm sensitive to sugars.	Anything with palm oil. I know there is sustainable palm oil but I still won't buy it. I prefer vegan items but I know that some of my all time favourite products do contain animal products.	0
Have you seen the "modesty and miners" post on Facebook recently? What are your thoughts on it?	I think we have to be *soooo* careful how we teach and frame the modesty issue when talking to young girls (boys too). If we're not careful, it can be very harmful to their self-esteem. Stuff like this makes me cringe so hard. And I'm all about modesty! But it's by nature a very sensitive issue, and needs to needs to be treated with a great deal of care.	Those ladies need to contact HR for sexual harassment. To avoid a lawsuit, the chairman should have just said, "Professional dress code applies here. Please change your outfit to something more fitting a business meeting." Also, you know what I love about this tract? I love the way it suggests that diamonds, gold, and pearls were given value "by God" rather than by men and women who like pretty sparkly things.	0
Do people really think there is no difference between having a height preference and having a weight preference?	Judging people for what they like or do not like is just silly. If someone does not like fatties, fine. If someone does not like skinnies, fine.	Yes. One is related to an attribute that can be changed (weight) and the other one to something which can't (height). So, don't let anyone shame you for having weight-requirement(s), just be smart enough to not broadcast the preference for everyone to hear. >/r/AskWomen I wouldn't take anything said on that wretched place too seriously.	1
What is the story you are proud of but can't just bring because it would sound like you're bragging?	I'm sleeping with 3 hot girls that have significant others, I don't bring it up because it sounds like I'm bragging and makes me look like a douchebag in some people's eyes at the same time EDIT: See what I mean?	I definitely have one of those. In February 2011, I was working for a medical software company. One of our clients was NASA. They blew up a system and it needed put back together in order to keep the schedule for the final launch of the Discovery shuttle in 10 days. I saved a shuttle launch by being really fucking good at my job.	0
Tall women of AskWomen, what are the pros and cons of being tall and how have they impacted your experience as a woman?	As an already tall teenage girl predicted to be 5’10-11, guys get intimidated. I’m bi though and girls don’t really. My current bf is 6’2 so we have a 5 inch height difference and it’s decent. I think guys are more intimidated by my intelligence etc than my height in the scheme of things.	I’ve found guys to be intimidated by it. Even though I personally have no issue dating people shorter than me, I had an ex in particular who very much believed I would never go for him because he was shorter than me. I hear it constantly that guys wont date a girl taller than them even though I also hear men say women don’t like short guys? The only other con would be clothes, whether it’s pants, dresses, skirts, or shoes, good luck finding anything. It won’t be long enough or come in your size (I wear a size 11 shoe). Other than that, it’s just whatever. Makes some sports easier.	0
What was your mom like growing up and how has it impacted your relationship now?	She was really stand off-ish and distant. More than one friend who has met her has remarked she may have some kind of mental health issue or illness. I just remember that she was always exasperated with basic stuff (like loading the dishwasher) and said we were "really needy" for wanting bed time hugs or kisses. She was glad when we "outgrew" that and "stopped touching her." We're not close, and have very little contact now.	My mom was always easy going and let me do whatever I want...at the time I thought it was great but now I wish she would have been more strict with me. It took me an extra year to finish high school because I skipped class so much and there were plenty of other things I did that I shouldn't have because I knew I could get away with it. I'm not blaming her whatsoever but it would have been nice if she put her foot down every once in a while. That being said I still love my mother, I talk to her everyday, I can talk to her about anything and we're really close. I couldn't ask for a better mother.	1
I just messaged my ex on facebook. What is the stupidest thing you have done lately?	First break up I spent 6 months crying over her. Second break up I realized I didn't want to do that. So the day we broke up I hit on some girls downtown and got laid that night. The following weeks I met a new girl each week, each more amazing than the last. Choose	I didn't delete my porn folder or search history whilst my computer was breaking but still usable. Now my friend is coming over to fix it and I'll have to spend the whole time looking over his shoulder.	0
What are the top five best decisions you ever made?	1. Joining rugby 2. Joining rugby 3. Joining rugby 4. Joining rugby 5. Joining rugby Everything else good in my life stems from that one decision. Friends, etc.	1. Getting out of the cesspool that was the part of nyc they dont show you on tv. 2. Moving to another country on a whim 3. Saying no to drugs 4. Being there for my friends 5. Buying a brand new mattress with my savings.	0
What weird thing do you find sexy about yourself?	I have scars all over my body. People around me have always insisted me on getting it checked out since the scars are freaky as fuck but eh, the scars fit my lean body perfectly.	I was born with an underdeveloped nerve in the brain that limits some facial movement. I can't smile with my teeth showing, but because of the limited movement I'm a really good liar and can deliver sarcastic humor well. My doctor said I won't get typical face wrinkles from this. I love my "perpetual poker face." Edit: not sure if it's related but I can stick my whole fist in my mouth.	0
Ladies who don't like a beard on a man... why?	I only suggest an actual full blown beard for a man with a weak jaw line. If he has a solid jaw line, that is one of the things that attracts me to a man the most, then you are hiding it behind a bunch of hair. A short beard/five o'clock shadow/scruff is still sexy though and you can see the jaw line.	Probably the same reason a lot of men don't like hairy legs. Some people just like less body hair. I like beards personally. Or preferably that nice bit of stubble some men keep.	1
What is the stupidest or most pointless free gift you've ever got with a purchase?	I bought a >€1000 handwound wristwatch from Stowa in Germany. When it arrived, it included a Stowa-branded cheap plastic tumbler, like you might get your drink in at a carryout pizza place.	I hate pens! I'm up to my ass in bird pens and flower coasters from British Red Cross. At Ryman's once the cashier asked me if I'd like to donate to Sports Relief, so I said okay, and then he told me to take a free pen. And I refused and he kept insisting. So finally I took a pen and I can't even use it because it has a rattle on the end of it. And they're always blue ink, why are they always blue ink? Black is so much better. Argh.	0
What Is Something You Do That Is Considered Feminine But Do Because It Makes More Sense?	I go for a good mani/pedi and let them put clear polish on my nails. My feat are banged up from Army and before that, 15 years of football. I had some major ingrown toenails and crap. I took my wife to get her nails done, and the lady at the shop encouraged me to get mine done too. She basically was a godsend.	Treating women like they're ormal human beings... Also I'll pee sitting down at home too sometimes, it's about the only way you can really do it with morning wood	1
What's the pettiest reason you've dumped someone?	He said "touche" the way we now say "lol". Like it was just a meaningless filler word used to respond to anything. "I'm not coming over tonight" "touche". "Grab me a beer and I'll be there in ten" "touche". I'm not even an English snob. I don't correct other people when they use the wrong "to" or anything. But that shit made me insane. He was also a late 30s barfly/bouncer still living with multiple roommates and dating 19 year olds, but it was the touche that led to the breakup.	Two months into dating, we went to see a movie. I bought a large soda to share and a large popcorn for him because I said I didn't want any. Throughout the whole movie he hogged the drink and didn't offer any popcorn. Stopped seeing him after that.	1
How long are you open to waiting for sex when dating someone new?	I’d prefer it sooner but I’d be willing to wait if I thought the person had long term relationship potential.	Until we're married. There's actually no reason for sexual intimacy in a relationship you don't even know is going to work out.	1
Houseplant obsessed people: What are your hacks? Was it easier to learn about plants online or from a book? How did you learn to not kill plants? etc?	Easier to learn online. For my garden I have a few books I always reference, but it's just easier to google the needs of individual houseplants. For me the biggest thing was don't overwater! Lots of plants die from neglect but it's just as easy to overdo it. Practice makes perfect and you get a feel for it along the way. I ❤️plants	My fiancé says filtered water makes all the difference. I always used tap water and killed my plants. He keeps his plants alive with filtered water.	1
Men who’s SO had plastic surgery after your relationship with them began, what were your thoughts about it?	its not for the man it's the woman's choice. as a guy, i would only ever want my partner to get surgery if that's truly what they wanted to feel better-there's probably a reason im with this woman pre surgery that part of me would be disappointed in seeing her change. but then you love the person first ultimately and everything else second. i couldn't handle being with someone who was trying to modify themselves for me or future partners. that would just be sad unless it was truly necessary/lifechanging and god, if a guy ever convinces a woman to get surgery for him, that guy is straight up EVIL. no i'm not married, no i've not been with a woman who got surgery later. but i answered anyway	Had breast augmentation. Was all for it. Had great results. Biggest lift was in her self esteem. Clothes fit better and confidence went through the roof. That was 19 yrs ago and we just celebrated 30 years marriage. She just farted in the bed next to me.	0
What was that moment when you were like "aaaaand definitely going to break up with you"?	When she told me she didn't want me to become the president of my Unis gaming club because it would take too much of my time. Ignoring the fact it was my dream job and I had been wanting it for over a year and a half.	When she had quit her third job in 3 months because her boss was some version of out to get her. Girl, there is a pattern here and it's you. I can't pay your half of the rent for the next six months.	0
Most snobbish behavior you've ever encountered?	My friend was on a break while working at subway and asked a lady where she had gotten her shoes (they were really cute) The lady replied, "don't talk to me minimum wage" and left in a huf. We were too shocked to say anything.	Oh man. There was a guy on the bus who scolded me for putting my feet on the seat. I was sitting with one leg folded under my other. It's not like I was treating it like a damn ottoman! And it was the bus. In NYC. A homeless person probably peed on it before. I know this doesn't seem to snobbish, but if you saw the way he said it, you'd know why this is still with me like 3 years later.	1
Men- what's a few things you wish your SO would 'get' about you?	I don't feel the need to cram as many activities into my free time as possible and it annoys the shit out of me when you do and then guilt me into playing along. Just because we have a Saturday free doesn't mean we need to have activity after activity after activity planned so we spend the entire day touring the whole god damn state. I don't mind doing things, but I also want to have some time to just relax without having to schedule it between activities and adventures.	I want her to get the fact that I don't like arguing but we start because she takes my jokes too seriously. And that she needs to know that I don't like weed, it's not cute.	1
Bachelors, what is your go to meat you cook often and how do you prepare it?	I buy boneless skinless chicken breasts in bulk, 40lb box for $45 at restaurant depot. Preheat oven to 400 degrees, rub chicken in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. I'll do other seasonings if i'm getting tired of salt and papper. 10 minutes in, flip, 15 minutes on the other side and check for internal temperature of 163-165 It's easy and cheap. I'll throw some asparagus in the oven too on some days, or toss it in a salad other days.	Instead of meat, try some grilled veggies. Slice squash, zuchinni, carrots, or any vegetable of the like in 1/4" slabs. Throw in a skillet with chili oil, sliced onions and garlic. Serve on toasted sandwich bun!	1
What's your "one simple trick"?	When you don't hear what a person says the first time, say "I can't understand you when you mumble." They will immediately think you're an asshole. Unless you say it with a smile in which results may vary. I don't know what I was getting at but I just find this response hilarious and want more people to use it.	After a shower, squeegee yourself off with your hands before reaching for the towel. Kinda like wiper blades on a car. You dry off 90% quicker and the towel doesn't get soggy.	0
You just won the lottery and never have to work again, but you're bored and want to. What job do you do or business do you start?	A bar where I'm shitfaced all the time and belligerent to the other patrons But SUPER cheap drinks so people always come	Puppy, hedgehog and bear breeder. That or I'd invest it all in the research to bring back dinos. Buy and island and build a lab there	1
Hello, dear wonderful women of Reddit. What can Donald Trump say at tonight's debate that would make you vote for him?	That this whole campaign has been to illustrate how far American society has fallen due to the evils of the two party system. He then goes on to outline his actual platform which falls ideologically far to the left of Sen. Clinton and apologizes abjectly for letting his experiment go this far.	There's not anything he could say that would make me not vote for him. Hillary's actions speak much louder than even Trump's words.	1
What fictional women do you find completely fake and unrealistic to the point of anger?	Donna from Dr. Who. I know a lot of fans just love her, but I can't stand her. She's the stereotypical loudmouthed annoying woman to the point that its like nails on a chalkboard just seeing her. It was way too over the top.	I can't remember her name, but the "love interest" in the second Indiana Jones movie. All that woman did was scream. The second movie was nearly unwatchable for a few other reasons but for me, the Shrieking Asswipe was a big reason.	0
How do I level up?	Unfortunately I believe that is just an issue with the era we find ourselves in. Due to the older generations of men having been a bunch of evil jackasses, most young men today are afraid of approaching women cause of the stigma of "men bad" that the media likes to propagate.	>How do I level up? Be clear and upfront in what you want and don't settle for less. If you're looking for a relationship and X is looking for something casual, clearly X isn't the right person for you, turn the page and continue searching for what you want.	0
Any other guys totally repulsed by the traditional idea of a bachelor's party?	No, I am not totally repulsed by the "traditional idea of a bachelor’s party". Where I am from, strippers and that sort of thing aren’t all that common anyway. But I don’t see anything wrong with it. For men who actually have real life sexual appeal to women, the sexual exclusivity part of a LTR and/or marriage *is* a "necessary evil". Most men are happy to make the trade-off when they have found a great woman. But most men who are actually able to obtain sex without months of courting, will to some degree feel the sting of no more variety. And that is what the "ritual" of strippers, lapdances, etc. etc. symbolizes that the groom is saying goodbye to.	FWIW I've been to around a half dozen bachelor's parties. None involved a dancer grinding up on the man of the hour, and only one involved a strip club.	0
What is something you feel guilty about doing but continue to do it anyways?	Drinking coffee and other liquids as a substitute for a meal. Like, I don't deliberately set out to drink a coffee or a smoothie in lieu of a meal, but I have such a small appetite that a coffee would make me feel full for hours afterwards.	Tossing a fistful of Cheerios on the carpet by my feet, for my 1-year-old to eat. Hey sometimes, she's freaking out and throwing a fit, I'm trying to get something important done, and I know it will distract her for awhile as she hunts for them all...	0
What can a woman do to make herself more attractive to you?	In all honesty, some physical attraction is necessary, but what qualifies as attractive is largely subjective. If you put any small level of thought and preparation into your appearance, you'll be fine. I'll ask you out the first time based on appearance. If you're 6/10 on my personal scale, I want to go on a date with you. What will keep me coming back, though, is personality. Are you fun? Do you seem to be a well-rounded person? Do we have interests in common? Don't worry about going over the top with hair/makeup/etc. If you can be a confident and fun partner, you'll be incredibly attractive to everyone.	Don’t use too much makeup. A tiny bit is attractive but I’ve always found too much make up is artificial	1
Fellas with full sleeve tattoos, anything you wish you knew before getting the sleeve?	Glad wrap is your friend after the tattoos. Proper care in the first week is paramount. Purchase a tub of aquaphor. For the first day, just wrap the tattoo with glad wrap. On day 2-4, smother it with aquaphor and continue to wrap it with glad wrap. Do this every 12 hours and wash gently with soap and water between dressing changes. After that, plenty of sun block and moisturizer lotion! I have a partial sleeve on my right arm that is gladiator armor that extends to my chest and back. I get compliments on it all the time when I am wearing a tank top. The more muscular you are the better just FYI. Muscles + cool tattoos = easy conversation with women.	Make sure you see a rough version of the design before the artists puts too much work in to it. They should be more willing to make adjustments and apply feedback if they havent invested a ton of time into it. Do not show up for your first session without having seen the final design. They may be the artist but you own the canvas.	0
What is the least selfish thing you have ever had done for you in a relationship? What is the most selfish thing you've ever experienced in a relationship?	Most selfless: The last girl I dated cushioned my fall when I passed out in the bathroom taking a piss after coming home from a hernia repair surgery.	Least selfish I have done: to help a girl in stuff which could give her more chance with her actual crush which happened not to be me. And I knew. Most selfish thing I have experienced: the girl I was dating lied to me not to lose my material support (rides, lunches, gifts) in spite that she had a quite formal relationship with other guy.	1
Is your girlfriend/wife funny?	>I see a lot on /r/AskMen[1] that women aren't "lmao-rofl" funny like guys. They aren’t. It is exceedingly rare. However, my ex-girlfriend was unusually funny. She could actually make me laugh out loud. That is rare for me. I really prized that in her. Edit: Wow, r/ask(premenstrual)women really leaked on this one!	Funny in that she says things that make me laugh - no. Funny in that she's a gigantic goofball, who is so silly she sends *herself* into gigglefits that in turn crack me up - 100% yes.	0
What is the weirdest presumption about female sexuality you have ever heard?	Dude here: Sex education is terrible for all genders, but I feel like it's worse for guys. Those gynecological maps in health class like sophomore year do a terrible job of indicating where everything is actually located on a woman, especially the fun parts.	There's this porn idea that women are obsessed with jizz, like when I sleep with a dude I just can't wait to milk him like a goddamn cow. Then I want to smear it all over my face and walk around like jizz Carrie. And at some point I want to save whatever I haven't eaten like it's my last meal in some kind of jizz beaker that I bought special for when I steal jizz, so I can make a lot of sexy stolen babies, because the only thing women love more than jizz is raising children as a single parent.	0
What are some safety tips all women should know?	I think it's worth mentioning that you are statistically more likely to know the person *assaulting you. So I would be careful of who you hang around with, let walk you home, meet online etc.	I'd recommend being armed and alert 100% of the time you leave your house. If you can't/ don't want/ are not able to carry a pistol, then at least mace, in hand, every time. Not just most of the time. Walk with purpose. Don't keep earphones in. Unless you're in the vast minority, you probably cannot beat a male- likely with nothing to lose- in a fight; use the "flight" part way, way before the "fight." Safety is way more important that manners or offending someone - if a stranger or party or situation feels uncomfortable or makes your Jimminy Cricket tick... LEAVE!	1
How often do you cry?	Every few months when it's late at night all my bottled up feelings come out for about 10 seconds. Then it's back to bottling them up.#Nurture	I feel as though a lot of you are either trying to sound like badasses or have some emotional blockage you need to deal with. Just saying. I cry semi often. Used to be that I hadn't cried for a period of about four and a half years. From age 13-18. Then I realized I was overcompensating for certain traumas and stuffing my emotions. Then I cried over everything that needed a good cry. Now I would like to think I cry a fairly "normal" amount. Of maybe a handful of times every couple of months.	1
If you could give one piece of advice to the single or unmarried women in your life, what would it be?	Would you be with someone who behaved like you and had the expectations of you that you would have of a partner? No? Then make some adjustments. Be the sort of person you would want to date.	Stop trying to find an “emotionally available” man. We are men, not your girl friends. You can sit around and spend hours talking about your feelings with them. That’s why you have friends. Come to us with problems that you want solved. That’s what we are for.	1
What is something your SO has done, that you've forgiven them for, but affected your self esteem?	Ex SO for me but we had decided to have a baby during Xmas. I was all ready for the sex etc. What did he do, he rejected my every attempt for a month. He said he needed time to think it through even though we had already made the decision. Mind I say he was the one who said to me "let's make one of these for ourselves" while holding his sister's baby girl on Xmas. I'll never forget the feeling when I had dolled up in sexy lingerie etc. And he rejected me walking out of the living room. I got so miserable I through the sexy lingerie into the trash and did no attempt anymore. We did finally get pregnant after several months.	He bought me a dermaroller for our first Christmas together because he didn't like the acne scars on my cheek. Although it made me feel self conscious about my face, I forgave him. He's an extremely kindhearted person; just oblivious at times.	0
Women who moved to another country for love, how did it turn out?	He dumped me and I found myself alone in a foreign country. My nearest family was hours away, and my entire friend circle was through him. I was completely on my own, no family, no friends, nowhere to live.	A story from a friend of mine. Men will dislike it I guess. Basically she married this dude she found online or something like that, he is from the US, moved with him, lived with him several years, then got a greencard and divorced him. Now she has a US citizenship, she moved her parents to the US, is married and has a kid with a European dude so her child has two most powerful citizenships. Smart lady.	1
Men who lost sexual desire for their partner then gained it back, what happened?	I wanted to just post "Alcohol" from the title but your post deserves more Sneaking about is fun until it isn't Parents in the house can be a real passion killer. Same with kids, just because they are there. Why don't you book a hotel room for the night, i used to do this where there was a pub (aka bar) next to it. Few drinks, back to the room and voila! The reason for the bar was so it wasn't just a go here, have sex, go home as that could create pressure. A night away from normality usually works wonders.	Hey may also just be asexual. I know in all the relationships I've had I feigned enjoying sex early on because I had the mindset that I'm a guy, I have to want sex, that's how it is. But I can't keep doing that and it eventually comes out, could be the case here as well.	1
What are the signs you look for in your own life to indicate that you're ready for a new relationship?	I'd say a big sign would be an general non-interest in getting in another relationship. That is to say, you're not actively looking for one, don't necessarily want to, and are happy being on your own.	* when you can enter a new relationship without prior experience poisoning you (I.e.: you're not ready if you go into it being paranoid about cheating because your ex cheated). * When you are sufficiently confident in yourself that you're ready to ask yourself if you like her as opposed to only worrying about her liking you. * When you aren't hoping a relationship is going to fix all your problems and resolve unhappiness you really should be working on.	0
What trait (physical or otherwise) does your SO possess that you previously found unattractive?	I don’t have a SO (yet) (hope to God) but I used to have a thing for big tits, ass, and tight clothes. Now, I don’t really care for it. All I want is a nice girl who likes and I like her.	Personality: I thought jealousy was an unattractive trait; in her it drives me crazy in the positive sense - all the way up to sexually arousing me. Physically: I never thought feet in general could be attractive, would have placed them between neutral and mildly gross, but her cute reactions when having them tickled made me like them.	0
What are the least glamourous parts of being a woman?	I'm glad that i don't have most problems other women have. Like i don't get my period anymore because i take the anti baby pill. (I occasionally get a little blood in my undies but that's okay. It happens only sometimes) My body is almost hairless and if i have hair it's so bright you can't really see it. Don't have any booby sweat cause mine are too small. I only hate it when your shaved pubic hair grows back. It's so itchy especially the part around the hole. Also if i don't clean my face enough before going to bed i get so many pimples..	* Waking up in a pool of blood. * Vaginal discharge *period clots * ingrown hairs from shaving your bikini area * pantyhose wedgies * what I call "poop roulette" aka not knowing whether I have to poop or it's just cramps when I have my period. * (though I'm not personally going through this one) all of childbirth and the afterbirth process.	0
Dudes, when you are kissing a girl, do you go for top or bottom lip?	I aim for a Gaussian distribution in the X and Y planes and chart her reaction. After about 32 kisses I begin to have enough data to construct a chart which allows me to establish her preferences and focus on those. I'll send you my spreadsheet if you need a little help getting going.	Top. It's already hard enough trying to kiss girls at 6'5, I'm not about to make myself have to crouch down even further. Top just makes sense, you know?	1
Women with serious mental health issues, past or present: how do you navigate life?	Not sure. I don't generally go out unless I need to, like work or to the store or something. I just generally feel uncomfortable with people all the time, especially if I have to talk to them. I recently tried a fidget cube, and I find it helps a little when I'm feeling nervous with people around.	I really have to view it as a chronic condition that has to be managed, that comes with flare-ups, that I'll probably always be dealing with throughout my life. I tend to go through spells of really hard times, and then the next day I'm totally fine, so I try to remember that the darkest times are not permanent and that things will get better. Getting enough sleep is huge for me, as lack of it triggers anxiety attacks. Also exercise, keeping social and reaching out to friends irl or online, cooking and eating well, meditating and just breathing deeply. I get really frustrated with how much I feel like I've held myself back because of mental health issues, but I also just have to remember that these are the cards that I've been dealt, and that I am doing everything I can to get to a better place.	0
Do you cuddle when you sleep? Or are you are non cuddler?	I'm a cuddler, my boyfriend is a non-cuddler. Also, he's a SUPER light sleeper, and I snore. So this is how we fall asleep pretty much every night: 1. Him on the outside of the bed, me on the inside. 2. Fan directly by his face, blowing at top speed to help drown out my snoring. 3. Earplugs in his ears to further drown out my snoring and any other noise. 4. Me sleeping with my back to him so my face doesn't dry out from the fan *and* to redirect my snoring away from him. 5. Butts touching to accommodate my need for physical touch. Also, though, we spend 20-30 minutes cuddling and kissing and talking before we get in our sleep positions mentioned above, and that helps me get my cuddles in too. He loves snuggling, just not when he's trying to sleep.	On the one hand, I like it as it helps to settle me and stop me from tossing and turning so I can get to sleep faster. On the other, it can get too hot and there's times where I just have to be in a different position. My SO is a total sleep cuddler though. He'll be sound asleep and I'll make a tiny movement and suddenly he's cuddling me so hard that I can't move an inch. He's totally unaware of it as well which makes it cuter.	0
what's something that has made your life significantly easier ever since you started doing it?	I started doing Yoga a few months ago and life is easier. I feel stronger, have better posture, carry myself better. I used to always have to have the TV on because I wasn't comfortable sitting with my own thoughts for an extended period of time. Now I love silent moments with myself and I think I'm a lot mentally healthier because of it. Sometimes I drive with no music on so I can be with my thoughts. &#x200B; Also the "two minute rule" is a good one. If it takes less than two minutes, DO IT NOW don't think "I'll do it later." Wash that dish, put that thing back in the drawer, pay that bill. Stop leaving everything to "soak" cause that shit piles up and becomes un-doable once it's a pile of dishes, metaphorically and literally speaking.	Washing my clothes. I read a comment on Reddit that in order to improve your social skills you should first take care of your appearance. I don't own a washing masheen and I'm sort of a clothes hoarder but I'm very OCD about which clothes go together so it's very hard to get dressed in the morning that I just ended up wearing the same outfit as 2, 3 and 4 days ago. I washed one of my outfits in soap and warm water in the bath tub and people actually sat next to me on the subway the next morning!	1
Men, if a girl were to take you on a picnic, what kind of foods would you be excited to see that she brought?	all you need is some wine and bread, with some meat and cheese to go with them. > Are picnics lame? how good is the view and how private is the place? I can't see an urban greenspace full of parents chasing their little kids being much fun.	Picnics are lame, when planned. When done in a surprisng way, they are awesome. You gotta do it right. Example: I surprised my girlfriend (now wife) with a picnic. But, more like an ambush. It was a beautiful day. At the time, I had a gorgeous 300ZX (T-Tops FTW). So I packed a few basic sandwiches, drinks, vase and a few flowers in a bag. I then waited at the exit of her work. So when she and her coworkers walked out, boom, there I am, picking her up in a cool pseudo-convertible sports car, and whisked her away to a nearby National Park, and had the picnic. The food was irrelevant. It was the thought behind the gesture, the surprise, compounded by the jealously of her coworkers.	1
For sexual assault survivors, did you have trouble calling it rape due to the circumstances (i.e. he claimed you consented but you don't remember)? How did you get over that, or did you?	I definitely have a hard time calling it rape. He was my boyfriend at the time and I would have consented to most (not all) of it had I been sober, but I was so drunk that I couldn't even hold myself up. I broke up with him shortly afterward for other reasons but for a few months I kept trying to talk to him and wanted to get back together. It wasn't until a year or two later when I was starting to have issues being intimate with my husband that I admitted to myself I had been assaulted and it could be affecting me. I'm ashamed of what happened during the assault but I'm just as ashamed of how badly I wanted him back afterward.	I have difficulty calling it rape because it started out consensual. And while it very quickly turned into me saying no and him doing stuff anyways (followed by violence and not letting me leave), I have a hard time. Nor did it necessarily affect me. I have moments, but nothing debilitating. I also kinda just went along with everything he did, as a means of self preservation. So in my head, because I wasn’t resisting, I don’t feel like I was victim. I called it a bad one-night stand for a long time, until I described the night to my husband, who informed me that it very much was something more.	0
As a uber driver who drives late at night, when I drop off female passengers, do I wait for them to enter their home/apt building safely, or is that creepy and I should drive off immediately?	I personally prefer when they drive off immediately, because when people sit there my main thoughts are "They're staring at my ass while I walk away," "They are trying to see which apartment I walk into," or just "Huh, that's creepy. Hope I don't get murdered in my sleep," ha. But I have anxiety that probably contributes to those thoughts, so it might be different for people without anxiety.	I'd be very pleased if a driver asked me what I prefer, and would most likely say yes unless I got some weird vibes. I've been locked out of my house with a dead phone at 3AM before! Without warning it may seem creepy.	0
A new dating app is launched. Instead of a photo of a person, it shows you a photo of their bedroom, car, kitchen, shoes, how they have their tea/coffee, things like that... what photo would tell you the most about someone, and would you be most interested to see to choose a potential date?	I have a thing about shoes, i think it says a lot how a person holds herself, but i also cringe if the person doesnt have "nice" shoes, there was a time where people would use those hiking boots for casual, or those ugly formal shoes...nope, plain sneakers are cheap and look the best. This is as a first interaction, second would definitely be their fridge, i cant stand people who leave cooked food for strands of times (plus my mom takes the nasty food out of the sink and plates and keeps it in a bag on the fridge), what type of food people have there and drinks.	There was an MTV show kind of like this called Room Raiders! Someone toured three bedrooms and then based on what they found, they picked which of the three contestants they wanted to go on a date with.	0
Ladies who use Tinder, how did you react when your date looked WAY different in person? Did you still enjoy your time?	Was another dating site but he turned out to be gay (I think). he spoke in a stereotypically feminine manner complete with wrist flicking. The date consisted of him talking about his "preggo" friends baby shower and how he bakes cake pops in his free time. He also talked about teaching his male friends about fashion and how to do housework. I think he asked me a couple of questions about myself at some point. He gave me the wrong address at first too and then i locked myself out of my car when i finally got there. Worst date ever.	He had straight up used someone else's photos. When he approached me in the coffee shop after I got over the initial shock of him being significantly older, significantly shorter, significantly fatter and a different ethnicity I literally walked out without saying a word. He tried to chase after me and then berated me by text. I told him he could fuck right off and since I knew where he worked because he had used his work number to call me I threatened to call the police if he ever contacted me again. I have no interest in being catfished.	0
If a girl took sexual advantage of me when I was extremely drunk, am I a rape victim?	You would be in court, if not jail, right now with your reputation in tatters if the roles were reversed here, much like the bloke who had fully consensual sex with the mattress-carrying girl in the USA. So I'd say you are a rape victim here and should seek vindication in whatever ways possible.	For me, it very much depends on how capable and lucid you were at the time. If someone has sex with you and you were too physically too drunk to prevent it happening, then yes, you have every right to describe it as rape. That's very different than where you choose to have sex in an inappropriate situation because you're inebriated and then feel uncomfortable about it later (even if the other person is stone sober and a manipulative sleazeball). Only you can really know where you fall on that scale.	0
Guys, what's something cool that you do for yourself on your birthday?	I really don't give a shit about my birthday but if I did, I'd probably take the day off work, not put on pants, stay well away from any type of productive activity, and spend the day drinking, napping, and playing video games.	I eat rich chocolate cake covered in double cream with a nice beer to go with it- it's a rare treat and something I only allow myself on my birthday. Birthdays aren't inherently special but it#s not tricky to make them that way :)	1
Seriously, what do I need to teach my son about cleaning his penis?	Also for both circumcised and not. Don't try to put soap in the pee hole. I tried this when I was about 4, and I regretted it. It's painful. Just don't do it.	I'm circumcised and I just kind of lather it and wash it, no further work needed ~~If he's uncircumcised then I think he just first needs to pull back the skin, wash, rinse and then let go. Maybe lightly dry it with the skin back? I don't know~~ I guess I shouldn't have answered the second part	1
Have you ever had an experience with someone "gatekeeping" your stress levels? How do/did you deal?	My parents grew up in near-poverty, and my mom had a "when I was a kid in China..." story for every complaint I raised about school. I respect the hard work they put in to provide me a materially comfortable life, but listening would have helped a lot.	Not a woman, just a dude passing by and could really relate to this in a way. I gatekeep myself essentially. I think to myself why complain about my struggles when there are others that are having it worse? Who am I to complain. So I just put up with it because it just doesn't fucking matter anymore.	1
What is the pettiest thing you've done to get back at/mildly inconvenience someone?	(Male, but sex isn't really relevant for this question, I think) I rarely get angry. I mean, the last time before this one was two years ago. Last week, a coworker said mean things to me (not about me, just *really* bad words). I didn't know how to react, since I just don't get angry. So instead, I 'punished' her for making me have to find a way to punish her. Didn't talk t her for a week. After that, I bought candies for her and shared with other employees.	I have two boxes of paper clips in my cube, the shiney newer ones and some grungy tetanus-y ones that came with my cube. When the CFO annoys or inconveniences me he gets his Monday morning reports with a tetanus clip.	0
Why would you stay friends with a rapist if you knew what he had done (and knew it really did happen)?	Nope, never. The rub of it, though, is that innocent til proven guilty. If we strung up every guy accused of rape, we'd be left with Pope Francis and a bunch of screamingly obvious gay men. EDIT: I'm not saying rape isn't a serious issue, I'm saying if I don't know, I've no business second guessing. Once it's known and convicted slam dunk, dude's so written off.	Fuck no. I would have cut them off from my life instantly. Especially since you even showed proof and it wasn't a pure he said/she said situation.	0
Do men tend to stare at a woman's "crotch" area?	You are wearing leggings and tight jeans. That causes men to stare at your crotch. They look to see if they can see anything. A camel toe, lip shape, and hair bulge, anything. It is in from our DNA. We see a good looking female and we want to have sex with her. Immediately. Name, personality, and everything else about her doesn't matter. That is why when guys cheat on their wives or ex-girlfriend and say, "It meant nothing to me.", they are really telling the truth.	Unless there was a very obvious camel toe or something, I would say they are staring at your legs, ass, thigh gap, waist, and/or hips.	0
What would you add to the list of these 'Women are in Charge of Their Bodies' posters?	I would want to see a dose of reality. Yes, it is your body and your decision, but decisions have consequences. Defying social convention will make you an outsider, and these posters don't recognize that. Each poster takes a piece of femininity and says "you are special and this doesn't apply to you if you don't want it to". But that is a lie. But maybe that is a feature, not a "bug", of the posters? I personally would be progressively unattracted to a woman as more of the poster content were to be cumulatively applied to one person. Maybe a disclaimer is needed at the bottom of the posters?	Women who don't have kids!! I'm not a selfish sociopath kid-hater who's going to die alone and have my cat eat my face.	0
Do the women you date seem to have a lot of problems?	> mountain of problems, whether it's severe medical issues, crippling self-image issues, fractured family relations, constant anxiety attacks, a history of sexual abuse, drug or alcohol problems, or any combination of the above. Most of that in my experience is made up bullshit, being a victim in the west these days is cool and easy, but really being a westerner and woman especially is easy mode.	You are the x factor. People with the kinds of problems you are describing have often lost the patience and sympathy of friends and family. They are quickly attracted to people that will listen to their problems, whether romantic or no. As a patient, good listener, these women are finding you. Were you a woman, guys like this would be finding you. You are catnip to folks that like to create and obsess over problems. You don't have to be rude or change who you are, but you should find ways to challenge people in conversations and make it clear you are not quick to believe the exact story you are hearing. This lowers your value to folks like this while keeping you just as nice and friendly to normal folks that think it's fair to be challenged.	0
What's something you can't tell your SO because it's better off they don't know?	He uses far too many emojis. Don't get me wrong, I like using emojis but seriously majority of his texts are just emojis.	That her friend has a dating profile. I know because I, too, have a dating profile and came across her friend's.	1
What’s the worst way a girl has ever broke the “girl code” with you?	# Friendly mod reminder here that our [Gendered Slurs Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/genderedslurs) still applies to this thread. There are a LOT of poorly-behaved friends/women in the stories in this thread, but you still do not get to use a slur against them.	# Friendly mod reminder here that our [Gendered Slurs Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/genderedslurs) still applies to this thread.

Dog pulled and gf fell and hit her face out on a walk. Probably gonna bruise up. How do I not look like a wife beater when we go out?	People are gonna look and judge, such is life mate. Some women will probably come up and slip her a help line number, that's about it.	You're overthinking this. People who are too quick to meddle or make this kind of assumption have no life and deserve no attention.	1
My SO and I are moving houses for the first time. Do you have any tips or tricks to make the moving process easier?	If you can afford it, just hire movers. It saved my partner and I time and energy that would would have spent arguing with each other because we were hot/hungry/tired.	Purge while you pack. If there are things you never use or have been meaning to get rid of, do it now. Don't pack and haul a bunch of junk and clutter around with you. It'll make unpacking go more quickly.	0
[Serious] How many of you men don't care for blow jobs?	Blowjobs are fine, but I'm not really excited about them. This'll sound weird, but blowjobs feel a bit... distant. For me, the best sex is a lot about physical closeness, about inhaling her scent, whispering in her ear how I'm going to make her come, crushing her against me, licking and biting her... a lot of that dynamism is lost when she's way down there and there's really nothing I can do except enjoy. It's fun foreplay, but for the main course, I prefer something that'll leave us sweaty and breathless.	That's hot as fuck. Cannot believe there's a man out there that would react like that to you. Move on woman	1
If you were given the offer to restart your life since childhood with all the knowledge that you currently have to change things, would you accept it? Why or why not?	Not a chance... I may be able to change my own circumstances, but I could not stop people from disregarding each other, valuing profit over our environment and just been down right self-serving ass holes to one another. Humanities motto, 'Bless me, fuck everyone'. I will not suffer stupid people any longer than I have to.	Fucking absolutely. * I'd be a lot more assertive in school, in terms of relationships. I still might not have gotten one, but I'd have a better chance. * I would have spent a lot more time with my dad. I Miss him every day. * I would have bought as much bitcoin I could when it was 6 cents in 2011, and I would have sold when it was $19,000 in December 2017. I'd be a billionaire today.	0
A woman that you have gone on a couple of dates with asks you over to her place at 10pm on a Friday to watch a movie and says "I hope you like alcohol because I have a lot." How do you think the night will go?	I'll get blackout drunk and deliver one of my famous drunken monologues on whatever off brand topic is on my mind this week before waking up in the morning hung over and embarrassed.	If she invited you over to chill and watch a movie, there’s a very strong chance you were invited over to chill and watch a movie. She was probably down for the night to go in either direction but your pushing made her uncomfortable and she shut down. Sorry you didn’t get laid. But hey, now you know.	1
Why do people always assume youre a dude on the internet?	I dunno. I actually often assume people I'm talking to are dudes on the internet also, much to my chagrin.	As a guy, I think it's because when we were all growing up and the Internet was young, it WAS mostly guys on these sites. I remember being a kid and having girls think we were nerdy for liking being on the computer and doing things like YouTube or whatnot. I guess the times have changed and more girls are online but the perception is still there	1
What are your least favorite AskMen threads?	Honestly, I subscribed to /r/askmen & /r/askwomen at the same time, and the difference is incredible. /r/askmen seems to be full of hostility, whereas /r/askwomen seems to be quite supportive. Both tend to have a lot of rants & complaints about relationships, etc, but the way the two subreddits *handle* the issues are so different. I'm male, and yet I find myself commenting on /r/askwomen much more often than /r/askmen.	The ones that go like this: I'm 16 and she's 14 and we had this huge fight and now I'm scared I might lose *The One*	0
What do you wish women would understand more?	Doing some housework and cooking is NOT the same as throwing your back out doing hard labour all day coming home with cut up bleeding hands and swollen feet, etc The time of men working hard and women staying at home is over. Yet I still encounter women who are perfectly happy to try to make men pay for their comfort. I love cooking, I don't mind cleaning. I would love having an easy life where all I have to do is cook and clean. I just don't love doing those things for someone who has been sitting on her fat lazy ass doing arts and crafts or playing video games all day while maybe cleaning one thing. I will only respect a woman who works as much and as hard as I do. Get a job.	You need to tell a lot of us if you want us to just listen or if you want us to provide solutions.	0
What are your opinions on spa days for men? Do you think self care on your hands and feet are important?	No, we should stop normalizing consumerism for vanity. A woman always showing off her new nails and eyebrows is a turnoff. A man doing it is worse.	The last time I tried to cut my toe nails I ended up with blood on the floor. So I went to a local salon and the attendant gently removed all the in-grown stuff and did a great job with the rest of the nails. Lots of weird looks from the women customers but I don't care. I'm going to keep going.	0
What was the most memorable way a girl approached you?	A girl came up to me while I was at a brewery with some friends and says, “hey you have a sticker on your back, did you know that?” I feel my back, no sticker. She proceeds to put a sticker on my back and says really quickly “and now you have my number too”, then runs off to be with her friends again.	Memorable but not in a good way. I was a 215 lb powerlifter at the time, but I was also lean. So alot of women would check me out a little or comment in my size. I never liked that attention. I was in a convenience store getting some coconut water on my way to play ball hockey, so I was in my tight athletic clothes. Lady came up and said "wow, do you play in the NFL? You look like a linebacker" as a way of flirting. I just looked at her, said "well that's a reach, lady" paid for my stuff and walked away. I'm 5'9 so no one that knows anything about football would think I'm in the NFL, not as a linebacker for sure.	1
Inspired by an AskWomen Thread: Bicurious men who have tried having sex with men, what made you dislike it?	Definitely the kissing aspect or anything sensual. It’s definitely a shame most women are wet fish by comparison in the bedroom. Edit: Am really sorry but there is much more zest I’ve found in men over women. It’s my experience not saying it’s true all over and that’s the question the OP asked so get over it	Honest answer. I dont know. Kissing heavy petting all that shit, up and eager. Reached the bedroom, stripped off ready to go and BOOM, soft, couldn't get it back up.	0
What podcasts do you listen to?	My Dad Wrote A Porno is hands-down the best thing to ever happen to me (sorry hubby). I have - legitimately - almost run off the road because of the tears streaming down my face as I'm laughing. Also My Favorite Murder.	I listen to Pod Save America, Lovett or Leave It, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, StoryCorps, and Ask Me Another!	1
Ladies of AskWomen - Have you/do you ever make assumptions about a man based on the car he drives?	When I'm driving and pissed off, these are the following assumptions I make: huge giant pick up truck = dude with small penis nice sports car = old dude shitty looking car driving slow = someone who looks like a hipster douche SUV tailgating me = uptight looking female (usually on her phone)	If there's something that stands out, yes. If it's just an average car, nah, whatever. **Student with really nice car:** "Wow, I didn't expect that. Must have been a birthday gift, 'cause I'm pretty sure he's broke." **Student with shit car:** "Ah. Typical student car. Probably got it third-hand from his grandmother. But hey, it runs!" **Guy with crumpled car:** "Ouch! Looks painful. I wonder if he got in a crash." **Guy with very big car:** "Woah. Dude must have insane parallel parking skills."	0
If you get into a fight with your clone, how could you win?	Presuming that the clone is perfect, the more important question here is whether it even matters which one of us wins.	Rocks, paper, scissors. The other concedes. In a world of violence and chaos RPS brings order. I'm not a pacifist, but only willing to engage in violence if victory is assured or desperately needed.	1
What can be done about people you have ghosted?	I'm always interested in how anti ghosting Reddit is. I've never once had a woman not ghost me, like I've never had a woman say something like "hey, not interested anymore, but good luck out there" and to be honest, I don't know if I'm just used to it now, but I'm not sure saying anything would be any different. Being ghosted is pretty clear, and if you liked the person it sucks, but so would any possible thing they could say. I get it's different for OP just because of the time frame, I'm talking first or second date. .	I was unaware anything ever needed to be done. Ghosting's fine. It keeps you distant, they can go full nuclear-meltdown on their own without threatening your life.	1
How do you feel about Cassandra Fortin, the 17-year old who was forced into chemotherapy against her will?	Some people need to be protected from their own stupidity or ignorance, I guess. Once she's eighteen I suppose no one can stop her, but it's sad if she actually wants to live but dies because she believes in ineffective treatment methods.	As her mother seems to be backing her choice, I'm not sure what six months of forced treatment will do for her. It seems both she and her mother are on board with stopping treatment as soon as she hits 18 anyhow. I would guess they will be especially against further treatment after making this six months of treatment extra hellish. Plus strapping people down and forcing medicine into them seems inhumane. I think both she and her mother are likely very wrong about the odds of her survival without medical intervention. I also tend to be of the mindset that at a certain point you give people a rope and decide if they want to pull themselves up with it or hang themselves. If she and her mother want to pick the latter, that's on them.	0
My fiancé just ended our relationship. Of two years. What do I do now?	In short: Focus on yourself, your heath, your schooling, your self-improvement. The grief is real, but it will evaporate over time. Trust me. You are very, very young and, if I can say so, too young to be getting married. I know everyone has different views on this, but your brain isn't even fully formed. At 36, I am completely different human than I was at 21. You have a metric shit ton of growing to do. In time, you will likely look back on this as a blessing in disguise. Mourn, and then embrace your freedom.	Get on tinder and fuck as many people as you can. This is the fastest way to get over a break-up. It does not matter the nature of the relationship you just left, or how long it was going on for, or how it ended. Fuck. Everything.	1
what specific moment made you realize you were in love?	Honestly - I don’t think I’ve ever had that moment. I do remember when I first saw him, and this is going to sound terribly cheesy, but everything literally happened in slow motion. It was from across a room at a very busy party, but I remember locking eyes with him at some point and it was just: “oh, there you are”. It was this extremely weird feeling of familiarity and ever since then it’s never been a specific moment, it’s just been a series of waves of “ahhhh, I love this human. This is my person.” We’ve been together for 3 years and 3 months now. He still gives me butterflies. I’m going to marry him someday. For suuuuuuure.	When she hit me across the face during an argument and I walked off instead of losing my head like I would at anyone else	1
Are white lies okay in your relationship or do you expect complete transparency?	Meh. I'm fine with lies about gifts, surprises, or how yummy the meal you prepared wasn't. But even beyond that, I don't expect complete *transparency*. Honesty is fine, but I don't need to know *everything*. I just need to have what you do want to tell me be true.	I would want complete honesty. My SO likes to tell me white lies. And I catch him on it. It drives me insane. I'm not upset but it's annoying. Because we have to have the conversation all over again. Just tell me the truth from the beginning.	1
Lesbians, what is your "creepy girl" story?	Not my story but my girlfriend... This girl pinned her to the wall super aggressively trying to kiss her. My girlfriend said no numerous times and was running away from her prior to the wall pinning. Girl just wouldn’t give up. All the while the girls boyfriend was watching... clearly unicorn hunters. My girlfriend had to yell at the boyfriend to get his girl off of her.	I’m a straight dude and I’ve had problems with creepy gay dudes...? It took only once before I understood how women feel about men creepin on them. My luck with women went up ten fold...	1

How much alcohol did (or do you) consume in your mid 20s? How much is too much?	That's how alcoholism starts. I know what I'm talking about. 30 years later I am 2 years DRY. Alcohol ruins a lot	what is "normal", though? that's definitely not normal for _me_, but what does that mean? that's just not what I'm into. besides, when I do drink beer, I usually drink the kind of beer that would be tough to drink 5-10 of. but again, every person is different-- I have friends that drink zero as well as friends who drink at least as much as you describe. question: what has prompted this? are you perceiving some issue, or does it just "sound like a lot"? just curious.	0
Who's the theoretical guy you're competing against in the dating world?	I'm in a committed relationship right now. However, when I was dating, I felt like the other guys had all of my strengths, but none of my weaknesses, and they can speak three languages, and have amazing abs, their back never hurts, and they always know what to do.	I'm not going to even bother with someone who is considering multiple people. If they go on a date with you and then decide to date someone else, your chance is done. It's over with.	1
What's your "did I really just get hit on?" story?	​Shopping mall toy and gift shop, I'm looking at cute stuff. Guy walks up to me. 'You looking for toys for your kids?' Thinking he's an employee, I say 'Nope, just browsing' (I'm just a grown woman who still likes toys, sue me). 'Huh. So, you married?' I look him over, realizing he doesn't work there. 'Got a boyfriend, but yeah, pretty much' and flash him the ring I wear to indicate as much. 'But are you happy?' he asks. 'Yeah, I am, very much happy', I say, while thinking what the fuck, he thought I had kids and wanted to hit on me, then heard I'm attached and thinks I'd wanna cheat?! Then he asks this whopper - 'Don't you feel this chemistry between us?' 'No,' I say, 'I don't.' '​You don't?' (sounding baffled). 'No.' He walks off looking sincerely gobsmacked.	whenever I get hit on when I have no makeup on, put 0 effort into my appearance, it’s actually pretty nice because I don’t feel pretty if I’m not all done up... and I’m rarely ever done up lol.	1
What do you do when you’re by yourself that would make you look like a crazy person if someone saw?	I talk to myself like I am 2 people talking to each other arguing different sides of a problem. Basically like real life playing chess against yourself. I use we a lot for just me, I use us and our a lot. I have a big family and had a lot of friends in school but in large groups I feel alone because I talk above most people when I am not drunk. I get drunk to dumb myself down to average American social levels. I was teaching adults computers for money at age 11. I am a great public speaker and not shy at all. I feel awkward when others joke about something I talk about because they feel awkward knowing nothing on the subject.	When I daydream I get absurdly into it, So you could catch me talking to myself/emotionally reacting I also pace while I do it lmao So a crazy, pacing person talking to themselves and maybe even crying or laughing it's a movie in my head basically e: I'm honestly shook how many other people here do this lol thanks for responding ladies. I feel a lot less crazy 😁	0
How did you choose your major in college?	Looked into which majors led to the best careers and which majors would be the best fit for me academically. I choose finance.	Looked through all the majors the school was offering and chose the one that made me go "yep that sounds easy"	1
What hobbies did you pick up in your 20s-30s?	Gardening is probably the most enjoyable hobby I've taken a liking too in my early 20s. I always adored my grandma's garden. It was a two-tiered garden and she cared for it meticulously. So much green, so many beautiful flowers in a rainbow of colors. So having my own house I kinda felt like it demanded me take some time to beautify it the best I could!	Knitting, big band music, banjo/bluegrass, gypsy jazz (for those last three, listening to. Not playing. I have what they call "dumb fingers" and "laziness"). There might be some other things, but that's all I can think of atm	1
At what age did you learn you were either very attractive, mediocre or just straight ugly?	14 when girls in my class were gossiping, about the guys they'd date and my name popped up, followed by an "Ew never."	Before yall read this thread (though this comment will probably be further down) None of this shit really matters long term. You are worth more than your ability to attract people. There are more things about yourself you could concern yourself with.	1
Women who grew up being told to always forgive and be nice even to hurtful people, how long did it take you to develop a backbone and healthy boundaries as an adult? Was the transition period awkward?	I’m still transitioning tbh. In asian cultures we’re taught to “not make a scene” or “just be the bigger person.” I also think that because of this it really strengthened my patience in people but you come to point you realize that you’re pretty much getting taken advantaged of knowing that you probably won’t say a thing.	I've always had a backbone. I was taught to "be better" than the people that hurt me. A common phrase my mother and grandmother told us growing up was something along the lines of "forgive everyone, but do not, under any circumstances, forget what they did or how it made you feel".	1
Got girlfriend pregnant. Abortion is set for Thursday. How do I be supportive?	My best advice would be to remember that being support doesnt mean showing no emotion. Don't worry if you feel yourself getting caught up and crying. Sometimes to understand that someone feels the same way as you do can be the most comforting thing in the world	Just two small things. 1. Does she want the abortion? 2. Having a baby young is not the end of the world. If you think you can realistically do it (not that it would be easy), would you permanently commit to the woman and your child? Just food for thought.	1
Ladies who are gamers: what's your favorite game and why?	I don't like the term "gamer" as an identifier for myself, but I play a lot of games. My favorite is Thomas Was Alone, probably. It's clever and tricky and simple yet infuriating.	I get so much crap for it, but legit Harvest Moon is my favorite game - or I guess up until A New Beginning & now it's Story of Seasons. People are like *it's just a farming game* but I like making money, taking care of cute animals, mining, fishing, establishing relationships. I think it's the nostalgia of it too, since I loved it as a kid.	0
I recently started spending more money on better, more spicy mustard. What mundane luxury do you give yourself?	the moment i felt like i made it in life was when i could buy whatever orange juice i wanted, not just whatever was on sale.	High octane petrol. None of that regular crap for me, no thank you. I actually feel bad when I've had to use the regular stuff, like I'm being cruel to my motorcycle or something. I actually do get better city commuting mileage out of the high octane stuff though.	1
How Do You Playfully Annoy Your SO?	I tell him bedtime stories. I make them up on the spot and they are horrendous. He hates nothing more in the world than my bedtime stories. In his words "your stories sound like a 3 year old telling the details of a fever dream." But I insist on telling them nearly every night. I try and trick him by saying I actually prepared all day and made a plot, but it's a lie. These stories never have a point.	She tells me deep, personal secrets about herself, and them I make fun of them. For example, my GF told me that she had a nose job as a kid after getting injured in an accident; I constantly tell her to be careful about her nose because she's got like a million dollars invested in it.	1
(NSFW) Women who have anal sex often, how does anal sex compare to vaginal sex?	They feel very different.. For me to orgasm through anal it has to be very gentle and with clitoral stimulation. However, *some* doods get the impression from porn that they can just dig their dicks right in. NU UH! For me, I prefer a finger in the ass for short periods of time rather than a dick. I only have a small anal plug so I definitely need to get more to work my way up to comfortably being able to take a dick. I've had big and small orgasms through anal. I've had no orgasms and bleeding. And I've also gotten UTI's from anal so... eh...	Lemme guess, this is you cleverly trying to justify why your girlfriend needs to give up her anal cherry. Too bad it seems to have **backfired**	1
Gender Neutral Bathrooms: Aye or Nay, and why?	Bathrooms should be gender neutral but separated for #1 and #2, and that second one should be strictly enforced with severe penalties.	I'm all for people using whichever bathroom corresponds to their gender identity, and there's no reason why single-stall bathrooms shouldn't be gender neutral. But when my college introduced an all-genders bathroom with multiple stalls, there were so many issues with peeping and harassment (against men and women) that they ended up turning it into a single occupancy bathroom. IDK, I lean non-binary myself and it's nice to see recognition of non-binary genders in society, but from a practical standpoint I kinda think widespread gender neutral bathrooms create more problems than they solve. People who don't feel comfortable using mixed-gender bathrooms shouldn't be forced to do so.	0
What was your biggest "She really did like me!" moment, and how did it affect you?	At a party in high school, a girl took me upstairs to "give me a tour of the house" that stopped in the bedroom. After we got in there I felt an awkward silence and broke it by saying "Ok i'm gonna go back to the party" and went back downstairs.	Dude, if you met a girl on Snapchat or Instagram, chances are she's fake or has some *really major flaw* if she's having problems meeting dudes in real life.	1
Have you ever found something out about someone you care about (friend, family, ex/current SO) that changed the way you view them? What happened? Were you able to "get over it" or get things back to normal?	Found out my dad was big into the PUA and men's rights communities. Still on good terms with him but I avoid talking to him about women/dating because he comes off as incredibly misogynistic.	Found out two friends were having an emotional affair with each other, behind their SO's backs. They ended up getting together officially while leaving behind the emotional wreckage of their previous relationships. There was a huge breakup. At first I thought "Well I'll just keep on being friends with everyone." But the combination of everyone shunning them, and me thinking about how shitty they are, slowly distanced them from most friends. I still say hi and make small talk if I see them, but that's about it.	0
How do you fit and betray your stereotype?	Stereotype: big native american Fit: Quiet Meek until provoked Physically strong but slow and deliberate Outdoorsy Kind of a drunk Betray: Well-read Technologically inclined Social chameleon Non-spiritual Can't stand having long hair	Standard geek Fit: * Overweight * nearsighted * sloppily dressed and shaved * mostly talk about my field (information technology, specially as it pertains to the web) * live with my parents (though I can afford living somewhere else and have done so already, but since currently I'm working in my hometown, there's no point spending the extra money). Betray: * I'm pretty liberal and egalitarian * don't like that many "geeky" things (not interested in conventions, board games, video games, games of any kind, only three tv shows, only one of which really intended at geeks; and I only watch genre movies because I watch *all* movies) * am interested in music and will probably/definitely take singing and dancing lessons this year EDIT: Format.	1
Fellow European men, when reading /r/AskMen, what are the biggest differences you perceive between European and American men?	To be fair, the US is just as vast and varied a culture as we have in Europe. Seems strange to pit one against the other. But in saying that I don't think there's as heavy a culture of "status" here as there seems to be in a lot of instances described on this forum and others I've read. Salaries and whathaveyou, especially in regards to dating, seems almost alien to me.	It's much harder for us to drive to Canada. Also, height seems to be a much bigger deal for guys in the US.	0
Engaged/married women of Reddit! How long into your relationship did your SO propose, and how old were you?	He proposed at two months. We were 21 and 26. We have been married for 30 years. That man is the best thing to happen to me.	We met at age 17, moved in together at 19, formalized our engagement at 28, and married at 29. The first discussion of spending our life together happened at 19 (I brought it up). There was no traditional proposal; we mutually proposed, it was not a surprise, there were no engagement rings.	1
Bisexual men, what are the differences between dating men and women in your experience?	Bi women here, in my limited experience I have not encountered too many duiferences in the dating process itself. Maybe that women have been more open in discussing relationship stuff, talk to test waters and to tell about any expectations and problems.And in the hooking up itself, men tend to be more "agressive" and the sex rougher, while with women it's more equal footed, more sensual and rithmic, also lasts more time since it's more fluid with a lot of ups and downs instead of a build up and done. Also I've enountered waaaay more women than men who enjoy going down a lot, for long and multiple times... (oh damn, had an awesome date yesterday and I'm having tingly flashbacks now)	Guys tend to be more straightforward with their intentions. They're also slightly hornier. Girls tend to hide it or do mixed signals. Girls are generally more affectionate and sweet. Also, the presence of a penis or vagina.	0
What are some common "millennial problems" that you can't understand or relate to?	I'm a millennial myself and i just don't get the whole "you can't _____ if you aren't _____" trend. Like yeah let's respect culture, but to me that's just creating segregation, and discouraging us from sharing and knowing each other and appreciating the good things we've all made. I mean i do want people to feel like they are respected, but i don't know where to draw the line sometimes.	I don't relate to the texting pressure in the dating world for today's young people. I've never had issues with conversations via text being difficult, issues with double texting and appearing needy, dropped conversations or misconstrued emoticons. I've never sent nudes or felt like I needed to in order to keep a relationship. When I want to say something, I text. When I don't, I don't.	0
About what % of your friends met their spouse in their early 20s?	I don't have friends, so that's kinda hard to answer. I married my first wife at 19, finally got rid of her at 27. Met my current wife, and my partner, at 32 and have been with them 25 years. Most of the people that I knew in high school were married and had kids by 21. THANKFULLY, my first wife and I never had kids... If she has gotten pregnant, it would have been by someone else's dick, because I tried to keep mine out of her as much as possible 😂🤣	I think here in Utah it’s a lot different due to the Mormon community. I know people who got married the day after graduating high school. Others within their first year or so of college. I am 23(f) and the majority of the people I grew up with are married (with and without children) and are planning for more children, building houses, etc. Since I am not religious, I got a dog instead.	0
How can women be better advocates and more supportive of men's mental health?	If a man opens up to you, try and be completely non-judgmental. It's hard for men to be vulnerable, and often even harder to do it in front of women- we're meant to be the supportive, strong ones and all that gender role stuff. People are stigmatising themselves in their head even as they open up. Sometimes women shy away from men who are vulnerable which perpetuates this. Be mindful of that, and be kind and listen. They've had to make this leap and try and trust you, so repay that as much as you can. You're only one person, you're not a therapist- always remember your boundaries when you're supporting anyone. But being kind and accepting can really help. It means a lot.	They won't ever be able to. Women do not and cannot understand weakness in men. It is a massive turnoff. It's just the way they're wired. Men are not supposed to cry about things just suffer in silence. If you think I'm wrong just listen to all the stories of men who "opened up" to their significant other. It doesn't end well. Bare in mind I am not shitting on women here nor saying men don't deal with these issues. But men should never open up to women about these things, or anyone for that matter. Seek therapy, deal with your issues, and move forward.	1
As a father, what should I not neglect to teach or do for my daughters?	Do 'man stuff' with her. Are you repairing the door lock? Putting a bookcase together? Even things like replacing the shower head, get her to do it! You do not need a penis to use a screwdriver and own a toolkit.	"It's not a father's job to teach his daughter how to be a lady, it's his job to show her how a lady should be treated."	1
What are your fetishes?	Skinny white men. I am a bigger black women and I like to beat them and humiliate them. Payback for centuries of oppression ;) Edit: yay I am getting attacked for my fetish!	I'm submissive, so basically everything stems from there, with limits. Actually, I'd probably be a switch, but I'm submissive most of the time.	0
What do we do, that women don't know we do?	SOME women are shocked to find that "watching 1 hour of porn every day" is pretty normal for men. Even the women that watch porn themselves.	The common perception is that men talk about their sexual exploitations freely with their friends, while women are more modest about theirs. I've found the exact opposite to be true.	0
Redditors love to bash women for having standards, but what are some ridiculous dating-requirements and double standards that men have for women?	TIL My Wife should be eternally fucking grateful for me. She was a virgin but I didn't care either way. She doesn't wax/shave with any sort of regularity, I don't care. She has long hair and the only time I gripe is during sex and it's all in my face because it's hard to keep a rhythm going or stay in the moment when suddenly Chewbacca. She used to shave and trim everything but got tired of it and each time more time would be between waxing and shavings and I'd just be like "I don't care. Pussy is pussy." She's got nice legs, hair and all.	With the guys I dated before my current SO, I noticed an expectation that I mingle and spend time with their friend group while they have no intentions of doing the same with mine. They might meet my friends once over drinks, but they would never want to hang out on the regular with my friends. Meanwhile, sometimes the only way I could see them was if I was going to hang with their own friend group.	0
Why is the romance novel genre so negatively stigmatized?	Start being open about it, that's really the only way to destigmatize the genre - plus - when you start being honest about it, you'll quickly find how not alone you are. Every time I do, people either go "me too!" or are actually really curious to find our more. It's really great. And you should absolutely do a podcast with your husband about the ones you read. Hopefully, his reaction will be in the same vein as [Paul Scheers](https://www.google.se/amp/s/ew.com/books/2018/01/15/paul-scheer-hockey-romance-novel-victoria-denault-score/amp/).	Partially due to to misogyny because they are associated with women and partially due to the common perception of them as erotic fiction/porn. I personally don't enjoy those kinds of books, but I see nothing wrong with those who do.	1
What's the most oddly specific Bro Code article you can come up with?	If your bro dies while at the gym, first put some more weight on the bar, then call the medical personnel/ authorities.	Article 150: if you still refer to a "bro code" and you are over the age of 18, you need to grow up	1

What is weirdest or creepiest phone call you ever received?	I got one from an unknown number describing everything I was doing at the time. I'd like to think it was one of my friends messing with me, but I didn't recognize the voice, and no one fessed up.	I was babysitting for a friend and their house was a bit remote. Usually a friend of mine and I would babysit together as he was the one that introduced me to this friend. This time I was alone. I got a phone call where all I could hear was the tv I the living room. The living room of the house I was in. I have never been so freaked out. I never babysat at their place alone again.	1
What TV Shows are everyone currently watching and how are they so far?	I’m switching between bloodline and agent carter. I’m on the last season of both. I wish there were more than 2 seasons of agent carter.	Mindhunter (a Netflix original) is so damn good. It takes place in the either the mid to late 70’s. The first season is out now, it has 10 episodes.	0
Brides often say they want their bridesmaids to be able to wear their dress again. Have any of you ever actually worn a bridesmaid dress a second time?	Yeah. In another bride’s wedding. The brides didn’t know each other and happened to pick out the same dresses so I killed two birds with one dress. Other than that... lol no	I was a groomslady and wore a black dress. I removed the “sparkly” part and now wear it to funerals. It’s floor length and really nice, but I can’t see myself wearing it anywhere else.	1
Why did you regret rejecting that girl?	I don't regret it. She turned out to be even crazier than initially thought. She went off the deep end. Got a bunch of tattoos. Constantly changing hair color and now has a kid. I dodged a crazy bullet.	She went on to date an abusive drunk who physically beat her. I never wanted to date her, but I wish her life had played out differently.	0
Guys who are with a woman who comes from a wealthier background, how has it impacted your relationship?	Dated quite a few rich girls. One thing that has always struck me is that the family relationship is way different. Their dads are almost always these overworked heroes that they worship. Which, coming from a lower middle class background, I'll never understand. I've dated a few that wanted me to be like their dads, and a few that were glad I'm the opposite. The other thing is that the money never really matters, but it does. They've had way more opportunities and can always walk away from obligations if they want to. The price for this is that there are usually stings attached to the family money and most of them hate but accept. So it changes the dynamic because you have to be cool with the conditions that come with the money. If you aren't, changing that dynamic is next to impossible.	I love it. Am British with a posh accent from a family that was once wealthy and poor now. Marrying my wife was essentially getting our house bought for us, now approx £500000+ and never having to worry about the bumps in life.	1
What "type" of girls (or guys) do you typically attract? Are these girls (or guys) the "type" you find yourself attracted to?	Spooky gals. The number of ghosts, spirits, psychics, demonic posessions, tongues-speakers, and shamans (shawomans?) I've encountered in my past ~9 years of relationships is way too damn high.	I attract stereotypical neckbeards because of my nerdy interests and black dudes because, for a white girl, I apparently have a bit of a booty and I'm also in the minority on my side of town. I'm attracted to atheletic, socialized nerds. I want someone who will run a 5K with me one weekend and go to comic/anime convention with me the next. Also, at 5'9", I am one of those evil women who like men taller than me.	1
What's the worst gift an SO got you that you pretended to love?	He got me Wendy's for Valentine's dinner. Actually, now that I think about it, he didn't actually buy it for me, he just* drove us there.	A super tacky Coach coach ring...one with all the Cs on it in a thick band. They had so many cute things that year...I also got one of his mother's old Burberry head bands. I hate Burberry and detest headbands.	1
Stealing this from AskWomen; What are the 5 best, and 5 worst things about dating you?	Best: I'm very cuddly. I can cook and enjoy doing it for someone else. I'm not bad at the whole sex thing. I'm laid back. I'm not going to cheat on you. Worst: I work stupid hours. I drink too much sometimes. I'm not exactly rich. I get distracted by dogs. I fall, fast.	Best: 1. I'm fairly good looking and workout. 2. I rarely get mad and have a cool head almost at all times. 3. I like to think I'm funny and sarcastic. If you can banter you have my immediate attention. 4. I'm fairly open sexually though I do have a strict no outside parties or pegging rule. Otherwise game on. 5. I'm adventurous and a natural extrovert. Worst: 1. I can breakup with you fairly easily if certain issues or problems arise. 2. I can be stubborn. 3. If you play games I will play games back and mine I can assure you are better than yours. 4. I'm a bit of a sarcastic asshole. 5. I'm fairly blunt.	1
How would you feel if a woman asked for an STI test on the second date?	At first it would be weird. Then I would imagine reasons why she would ask that and conclude that she would like to fuck. Which leads to me agreeing to take a test if she does the same. Let's go do the tests together why not?	I would move on; out of all of the women I've been with, no one has asked for one. I'm just honest with them and tell them the truth as they are with me. Asking for a test is not the norm in today's culture and it would inconvenience me more to have it done than not.	1
(Young) Japanese Men of Reddit, Why do So Few of You Date? What Factors Are Keeping You Out Of Long Term Relationships?	Not Japanese and not male but thought it'd be cool to add. The Japanese language apparently doesn't have a phrase for "I love you". The phrase they use is more like a "I really, really like you."	I'm japanese, born in Japan, raised and currently living in Canada. I never really got this meme of so few of Japanese youth dating. Its moreso they aren't getting married and starting families. All of my japanese friends (~18 yrs old) have been in at least one to two relationships, and I'm currently in a relationship. Seems like japanese people are especially reserved around new people or outsiders to their group and take time to warm up to them. Especially japanese girls. They're like the polar opposite of western girls who are instant best friends literally minutes after they just meet. It could also being the culture that promotes obsession about whatever interests you, be it work, school, hobbies or whatever that end up leaving no time for anything else like a relationship.	0
What are some things that are sexually biased that people don't talk about?	The Smurfette Principle is something that shows up in a lot of shows and movies. Basically, if there's a group of characters, they all have their "thing"-- someone's the smart one, someone's the funny one, etc. The lone female character is the girl one. The boys are individuals, and the girl is just not a boy.	Women have more earth-shattering orgasms and it's fucking not fair. It's not fair fucking either. What do we want, female orgasms, when do we want them Now!	1
What is an insecurity that you only have because somebody else pointed it out to you?	I used to only shave my shins, with the rationale that most people can't really see/don't notice the hair on your knees and thighs because it's thinner. Then my friend "helpfully" point out that I'd forgotten to shave my thighs. Now I'm always anxious about it. Oh and my mom pointing out my mustache was super awesome.	I eat *really* fast and everyone thinks it's something worth teasing me about. I don't do it on purpose, it's just the way eat. Leave me alone, please.	0
Women who have had plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons, what did you get done and why? How did it impact your life after? Do you regret anything?	When I was about 10, I had my ears surgically pinned back. It was my mother's decision, I didn't really have a say, but she hated how they stuck out (she later had my youngest sister have the procedure as well). It hasn't really impacted my life at all, and I think it's because I was so young, and too young to even have a complex about my ears. But I often wonder if I had never had the procedure when I did if I would have grown to be insecure about my ears later.	I got 8 moles removed about 2 months ago (I am a super moley person). I chose ones that either stuck out loads or were weird looking or a combo of both. Even though one turned into a keloid scar I'm happy I got it done, the one on my forehead was nicknamed 'mount Everest' by an imaginative boy at school. And I love to run my fingers over where they used to be and just feel flat skin, except the keloid scar but I'm using bio oil and it's still smaller than it was.	0
Aside from the gates of Hell opening, how does your period affect you?	It seems that about two or three days into my period, I start feeling really really really sick, way worse than any stomach bug I've ever had. I have no idea why this happens. It started happening very suddenly a bit over a year ago. Birth control is the only thing that keeps it at bay.	I get RIDICULOUSLY horny the day before/of and will do literally nothing but masturbate all day between bathroom breaks and if food is brought to me in bed. During the three days I have it I maintain a bit of that horniness to a lesser degree and have mild cramps. I also experience emotions 2fold which I find annoying.	0
Men, have you ever had a woman accuse you of being sexist or anti feminist and what caused it?	I was talking to my mom and sister. We got on the topic of children. I personally don't want to have children, but if I did have a son, I had a name for him. My mom asked me if I had a name if I had a daughter, I said no. She called me a sexist pig that was no better than my father. I love talking to mom.	Feminists are very vocal online, so popular message boards and media sites feel dense with SJW's. Most women I know don't call themselves feminists. But I've never actually encountered these adamant feminists in real life. I think it's because they know that without their safe space filters and echo chambers, they'll get torn apart by the logic of reality Also, I never went to college, so that probably spared me from them.	1
What are your toxic traits?	I make funny jokes and I'm pretty witty with puns n stuff. I argue with myself so I'm pretty amusing after all aren't I?	I don't forget *anything*, and I can't let the past die. I'm actively working on remembering that sometimes the past is the past and to focus on what's in front of me right now.	0
guys who are afraid to get into a relationships ? what makes you afraid ?	I wouldn't say I'm afraid. Fatigued, perhaps. Relationships these days are just too difficult. You can't count on anything to be predictable or sure. The standards are constantly being redefined and the relationships lines of do/don't are always moving, when everything is under scrutiny for offense or relationship power dynamics. I'm just tired of trying to prove myself as a decent and stable person who wants to be a good companion with equal give and take when that's just not good enough anymore.	Some **psycho bitch** who appears normal, however threatens to bruise herself and call the police reporting I did it to her (we all know who the police and court would believe). Or even better, she's mad at you and falsely accuses you of rape. Even if you are found innocent in court, the mere allegation would have destroyed your professional reputation (especially if you are a medical doctor, lawyer, or professor) and subject you to public scrutiny from your friends, family and local news. Relationships are unsafe legally for men.	1
Where is it okay to ask out a woman, other than the bar?	if youre average looking and with good style and grooming. anywhere really. but this takes practice and lots of confidence. on top of this ,if youre also a naturally introverted guy like me, then its going to be difficult. feel free to pm me if interested to talk more about this.	Anywhere but context matters. For instance, striking up a conversation with someone on the street and at the end of the conversation asking if she’d want to meet up for coffee is different than yelling “will you go out with me” to a woman that’s walking by. It’s just a matter of paying attention to the context. If someone’s appears busy going about their day, interrupting them with the intention of asking them out may not work out too well. If someone’s at place where people go to socialize, you’re probably okay striking up a conversation with them and then seeing how things go	0
How to tell my girlfriend I'm worried about her getting fat in the future without coming off as an arse?	> She'd run and used to be on various volleyball teams. Unfortunately due to work and a shitton of stress, those activities had to be put aside Also, she's now in a relationship, she can let herself go.	You can just say that you're worried about her health because all she eats is fast food. Fat or not, that kind of diet is just not good for you. If you make it about her getting fat and unattractive to you, that's what makes you an asshole. But at the end of the day, you can't force her to change. If she doesn't want to work out and doesn't want to eat better food, well, that's her decision.	0
What dates have you guys gone on where it started off really good, but then had an unexpected turn for the worse?	Went on a second date after a stellar first date. Go to an Italian restaurant great food. The whole time since the first date she's asking when she can meet my dogs because they are so cute. After a great meal I ask if she wants to come back to my place to meet the dogs. She says "yes"; oh boy here we go this date is only getting better. We get to my place; she instantly starts sneezing and coughing. Turns out she's allergic to dogs. Drive her home never hear from her again.	About 5-4 years ago I went on a date with a girl that knew my ex and we bonded a bit trashing her and then went bowling. Everything was great until we went to an eatnpark afterwards. We got into the topic of religion. Well. I believe when you die, you are dead. And she is a hardcore Christian girl. Needless to say I offended her a bit with my beliefs.	1
My wife told me she's no longer in love with me and is considering divorce, what should I do?	Love is a choice. She hasn't fallen out of love; she has decided that she no longer wants to show love to you. That's pretty crappy of her. I don't subscribe to the idea that we fall in and out of love. Love is an action, not a passive emotion. We don't need to feel love for someone before we show love for someone. Right now she has a choice of whether or not to love you and she's choosing not to. It sucks. Then she's hiding behind the excuse of "not feeling like it". There's a chance there is something deeper going on. I'd encourage you to take what you can out of marriage counselling and use it moving forward in other relationships. You can't make her stay. This is unfortunate and I'm sad to here this. :(	Went through something pretty similar although without children. One day out of nowhere Wife tells me she doesn't love me anymore and hadn't for months. She checked out emotionally and when she only agreed to reluctantly work on it, it only lasted a week. She only did it in the first place to feel less guilty about leaving. Kind of like "Well, I tried!" I feel for you, man. This sucks. It will get worse before it gets better. Don't try to rationalize it as none of it will make sense. She's been thinking about this for months and has already justified her actions and is probably just humoring you. Start planning for a divorce right now and focus on your children. Again, I'm really sorry. Best of luck to you.	0
Any guy heard of "the grapefruit technique"?	I cannot begin to describe how quickly i would lose my erection if a girl sounded like that when giving me head.	First you going to cut of ONE side of the navel. You take that side off then you take it to the other side and then you .... do the same thing. SO why not just say "cut the navels off"	1
[Serious + sensitive] What would you do if you knew your unborn child was going to have a disability?	Abort. Life is hard enough being a normal functioning person, bringing someone into this world with a clear disadvantage is just cruel to the kid, and not fair to yourself	Whatever you do, don't abort the baby. Have you considered the possibility that the doctors could've made a mistake? Before I was born, the doctors sat down my parents and talked about the very high probability that I would be born with down syndrome and proposed aborting me. Well today, I am a straight A college student. Just think about that.	1
Men browing this sub, what are you hoping to learn or what have you learned by hanging out here?	I've learned that women are so critical about every facet of the man's role in the relationship yet don't give men any hint to the fact they're being judged on every micro behaviour against some invisible scorecard of how men should behave. It's like women see men as some type of perceived level of how a man should be, then are constantly scoring them against that model in their mind. Down to quite intense levels of scrutiny that the men have no idea that they're even being judged against a list of qualities that the women has in her mind that she wants from him. &#x200B; That isn't a criticism, merely an observation on how different we are in our approach towards living with a potential partner.	Wasn’t hoping to learn one specific thing. Was just painfully aware that there was A LOT I didn’t know, so I joined hoping I could get some much needed perspective, a chance at seeing the picture from the other side...	0
What's the latest movie that made you go "holy shit!"?	Just got done watching The Prestige a little while ago. That movie is a devastating mind fuck (in the best way possible). YOU DON'T KNOW?!	I started reading this post because I wanted to collect some new movies to watch... Not new movies and spoilers on recently released movies. Thanks.	1
What's your "right person wrong timing" story?	My last Ex. Graduated with her Bachlor's trying to get her career started and I was just barely re-starting community college. We had a lot in common and had good chemistry so we dated. 9 months later she got a temp job in another state. Tried to make long distance work, but she didn't wanna do it anymore. I don't hate her, but man moving on has been difficult.	My current boyfriend. We met through a mutual friend freshman year and really liked each other but never got to hang out since he lived a couple cities over. we always kept in touch but finally started seeing each other romantically senior year but since it took him and hour or more to ride his bike to my house and because we both became too busy, we slowly stopped seeing each other. I was heart broken, id always loved him to death so 6 months later, as soon as i got my car, the first thing i did was drive to him. It took over 4 years for us to end up together but worth the wait. We live together now but i remember all the nights we stayed up all night on the phone and how i'm really lucky to wake up next to him every day.	1
Do you ever feel like you're not "allowed" to talk negatively about feminism/women in general?	Wow, really? "I'm not allowed to express negativity towards people *without those people attacking my opinion*" That's amazing. Why on Earth would you *expect* people to "allow" you to talk negatively about them? *Of course* they're going to be bothered by it; of course they're going to tell you that you're an asshole and that you can fuck right off. Don't tell me you wouldn't do the exact same thing.	Even as a woman I feel like I can't state my own opinion if it goes against women or feminism. People get super offended when I state that I am not a feminist nor do I want to be. I think the feminist movement needs to be updated to the equalatarian movement and focus on all of the inequality in our society, not just mostly women's inequalities.	0
Women of reddit, have you ever had an ex commit suicide after break up, either shortly after or years later? If so how did you feel about it?	All please let people share their stories and assume they are giving the details they want, rather than pressing them on what if's. Thanks.

What are some dating/relationship issues you see guys worrying about in films and on TV that aren’t worth worrying about in reality?	Uhm, isn't that like *most* such "issues" in films & TV? I mean really, it's generally there for the entertainment value ... not reality (and "reality" TV is anything but), and generally not a documentary. Sure, there are *some* exceptions, ... but they're that - exceptions - not the rule. Heck, I'm sure there must be *some* examples, but I can't quickly think of, off-hand, any dating/relationship issue of some guy in a film or on TV that would actually be worth worrying about in reality.	1. The whole meeting the parents freak out, I get being nervous but the movies make it seem hilariously doomed. 2. The demanding promotion, there shouldn’t really be any issues with this, do these couples not talk about what they’re trying to do with their careers? 3. The hot ex- boyfriend you run into at a bar while out with her, there’s a reason he’s an ex. 4. The first time he cooks her dinner, there’s always a fire or something. 5. How things get serious all of a sudden. In my experience it’s usually a gradual thing and not a surprise to either party. You’re just plodding along taking the logical next step. 6. The proposal. If you’re that serious about each other the M word comes up a lot. You would normally know where she stands on it. If you don’t then you shouldn’t propose. Edit: your/you’re	0
As someone who is not interested in casual sex at all, how do I avoid going on dates with guys who just want casual sex?	Sex is an important part of a relationship, not something naughty and dirty that only souless degenerates engage in. I'm a relationship-minded person, but I wouldn't continue to date somebody who I didn't sleep with on the first or second date. To answer your question, you can't, really. Saying "I prefer to wait until we're a couple" is coming on a bit too strong, and uncomfortably old fashioned, but your choices boil down to that or risk wasting your time.	If you don't want to participate in the hookup culture, if a guy asks you out you need to tell him you would like to meet up for a lunch date or meet up at a coffee shop for dessert and coffee during the day. Then communicate with him. You don't have to say you aren't interested in casual sex, but it is fairly easy to let someone know that you are relationship minded so then he has the opportunity to ask you on a more "formal" date if you seem compatible.	0
Ladies who lift weights, whats the best/worst thing about it?	Best thing: Feel strong and powerful. Seeing muscle definition. Eating more and not being underweight anymore. Worst thing: Sports and normal bras just seem to be getting tighter and I need to buy new ones often. Clothes that used to fit don't anymore. Also, hamstring doms are the worst.	Worst: Pelvic Organ Prolapse. Ladies, if you have had a vaginal birth, be aware that not all exercises that were designed for men are appropriate for women.	1
I keep hearing all those birth control horror stories. Does anyone actually have a good experience with going on the pill?	Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects. Sex drive is terrific, no depression (even though I'm a risk group), no weight gain. And while I believe each and everyone who suffered side effects from the pill, I also feel like it's just very trendy right now to condemn it. But for so many women it's the best form of contraception, otherwise there wouldn't be so many using it.	Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects.

When I drive a girl home after a good date, I drive just a little slower than normal to spend a little more time with her. What little things like this do you do on your dates?	This is the complete opposite of me. I want the date to be over with so I can go home and relax in my solitude.	I usually start a long conversation about 3/4ths of the way home that way we usually end up parked outside her home just talking.	0
We hear a lot about attractive women frustrated that a lot of her male friends are just trying to get in her pants - attractive men, do you have the same problem with your female friends &amp; how much do you hate it?	I can't agree I'm attractive, but I get a fair amount of attention and female friends who want to sleep with me but it never severely bothers me nor do I hate it. Women seem to be more subtle about expressing it either way and I never put myself in situations where I'm alone with them. Only irritates me a slight bit since I'm more of a super-longterm relationship kind of guy and dislike the idea of one night stands.	No, because women never initiate. They just sort of awkwardly hover nearby waiting for you to make the first move. That's easy enough to ignore.	1
At what point did you feel like an adult? Started seeing yourself as a woman rather than a girl?	I was sixteen. My aunt had just died, my mom was suicidal, my sister was having a really hard time in school, my dad was getting arrested (not that we even lived with him), and my grandma was just starting to show the signs of senility. I became the head of my house then. And all I could think about my life was that it was all very rude.	I'm 23, not yet. which is funny because I moved out when I was 15, got my first job while studying when I was 17. Have worked and moved further and further away from my parents and family. Had a long term relationship for 4 years that crashed and burned. Now I live in another country with what I'm pretty sure is the love of my life and yet sometimes when I call my mum to complain about bills or budgeting she just goed "Isn't it nice to feel like a grown up?". Pfth, I still feel like a 16 year old just faking it. I don't think I'll ever start feeling like a woman.	0
What is something that many other women do that you can't really relate to or understand?	High heels (over 3") as work wardrobe. How do you not end up with aching feet and legs every day?	1) wearing too much clothing. I don't mean wear a bikini all day, but I can't wear more than a layer or two without being uncomfortable. 2) wearing excessive amounts of jewelry. This probably goes with #1, I just don't like wearing lots of clothes. 3) makeup and hair routines. Why lose multiples of hours of sleep just to look like everyone else? AND it costs oodles of money. NO. THANK. YOU. Edit: Funny that some seem so offended by what I said, I was answering a question and interacting positively to those I spoke to in the thread. If you don't like something move on, right? So why the downvotes?	1
Do you feel like most women are better looking when dressed?	I appreciate girls who put a lot of time I to their clothes and makeup, but I'll *always* opt for waking up next to someone without makeup or clothes.	In the southern USA, yes. There are so many fatties and so much loose skin and stretch marks on former fatties, and they look much better with clothes on.	1
Guys, what is your SO flaw that someone outside your relationship would see as a red flag?	I've lost friendships over this one. Before I do anything, I check in with him. Not in a permission kind of way, but in a "hey I want to do this with X, can we afford to/is that cool?" Because sometimes he had something planned for us that night, or he had a hard day and needs me around to help him decompress or whatever reason. And in the beginning of our relationship we were dirt poor and sometimes we couldn't afford to do stuff. Apparently this makes him abusive and controlling. But he checks in with me before he does anything too. I think it's just relationship common courtesy but whatevs.	Well my girlfriend is Mexican, so there are a bunch of backwards Americans right now that would call that a red flag. Luckily we live in Canada.	1
What do you think makes a woman "high" or "low" maintenance?	I hate high maintenance. The finer points being "low"...... ...not spending an hour getting ready to go out. ...if your outside at an event and it starts to rain, she doesnt complain about her hair getting wet, ruining her makeup, or running to hide in the car. ...being able to think for herself, and figure out her own life without handholding. ...not holding herself to stupid standards, like needing the newest purse, or only wearing certain brands.	It's about demands and personality traits that inconvenience/impact you. A low maintenance person will not inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. A high maintenance person will make it a point to inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. The world revolves around high maintenance people in their mind and IT BETTER REVOLVE AROUND THEM IN YOUR MIND TOO OR ELSE! Pretend your SO is a vegetarian. A high maintenance SO will insist that you cannot have meat in the house nor eat meat in front of her nor be near her if you smell of it. A low maintenance SO will do none of that and will even go to a steakhouse with you so long as they have vegetarian selections.	0
What new things did you learn about your SO or your relationship after moving in together?	I found out mine is a hardcore snuggler in his sleep. I mean, ***hard core***. Like, arms and legs wrap around me like vines. It isn't a bad thing, most of the time, it was just unexpected He also found out that my socks can end up literally anywhere. For whatever reason I can't control them	I haven't officially moved in with my boyfriend just yet. That's happening next week! 😄 but I've basically been living with him the past two months. I haven't really learned anything new since I started going to his house after work instead of my own apartment and my dog is now living at his house . . . Eh, turns out he really enjoys my pup and is so sweet. He bought her treats and is treating her new tricks. I wasn't expecting that. Besides that, nothing else was new.	1
Men who currently date, or have dated a black girl, have you ever had problems from black men?	Lots of black women get angry at black men who date outside their race. The main two groups of people who have the highest percentage not in a relationship are black women and Asian men. So when a black guy, especially one with his life together goes outside of their race it's seen as being a race traitor.	Whitey here, been married to a black woman for 4 years. I can count the number of times she's been approached by a black man in front of me on one hand, and even fewer times did they mention my ethnicity. She's taller than me, that gets mentioned more often than our races. BTW White man/Black woman couples have the lowest divorce rate of any mixed ethnicity combo.	0
Men who are frequently rejected by women: how do you stay confident? What helps you continue to approach other women after you've been rejected over and over again?	Take honest stock of what you actually have to offer. If it's good, then keep going. If not, work on improving yourself. And understand that dating isn't a war zone. It's an audition. Just because you're not right for the part doesn't mean you're bad. Edward Norton is a hell of an actor, but you wouldn't cast him as the lead in a Martin Luther King Jr. biopic.	Only approach women who are out of your league and you expect rejection from. **NEVER** approach women who are beneath you and risk rejection from them. Think about it. If you apply for a job as CEO of a major corporation and get rejected, who cares? It's what was expected. But when you apply for a job working the front line at the local car wash and get rejected, that hurts! How fucking awful are you that the goddamn carwash won't even hire you?	1
What is something you don't realistically expect your partner to do, but would greatly appreciate if he did that for you?	I'm not in a relationship, but when I am I love and always secretly wish to be surprised by flowers.	It's shallow, but I really like presents. Even something small. I think it's so sweet when you mention something once and a person remembers and gets it for you. I keep a list in my phone to do this for other people, just because I like being the king of presents.	1
How bad does IUD insertion actually hurt?	It was very uncomfortable for 2-3 minutes, then I had a day of period-like cramping which was relieved by Advil.	My GF just got her second one (after her first one fell out after a few weeks - luckily she noticed). Hate to tell you, but she described it as the worst pain she ever had...	1
What podcasts are you listening to?	Ignorant philosophy Joe rogan Adam Corolla & dr drew show Bill burr Ari Shaffir skeptic tank The bone zone podcast Ted hour Stuff you should know	- Death, Sex & Money - Freakonomics Radio - Hello Internet - Lets Make Mistakes Together - On Being - Rooster Teeth Podcast - Stuff You Should Know - The Art of Charm - The Co-optional Poscast - Think Again - Waking Up with Sam Harris I also used to listen to - Cortex - TED Radio Hour - The Patch	0
Why don't men get as much of a thrill over fictional romances as women do? Men fall in love too, so why don't they enjoy a good love story? And if you do, what are your favorites (TV, books, movies)?	It's boring as fuck, and reading/watching hundreds of pages/episodes is way too much work to bust a nut. Watching porn is alot easier and more entertaining	Aren't a lot of cheesy "guy" movies fulfillments of what you're asking? Guy gets the girl after intense trials of his abilities of the subject of the movie. Off the top of my head, diehard, dodgeball, shrek, etc. I can't think of any movies off the top of my head where guys are the object of pursuit from women other than movies that are strictly aimed towards "strong females." I could just be drawing a blank here.	0
Men of Reddit, what is it like to have a dick and balls?	>Any struggles Random boners happen. Mostly when you can't use 'em. >benefits No menstruation. *It's also like a built in water gun. Destroying a urinal cake is as satisfying as the other side of the pillow. >inside jokes If I laid my dick on your keyboard it'd go all the way from A to Z.	At the very least having male genitalia makes it more difficult to get sex. So many more hurdles to go through just for a hookup. A guy has to have game, a semblance of looks and can still be shut out depending on the whims of the woman in question.	1
Men who are honest/have little to no filter in real life, how often does it get you into conflict?	I used to be like this, but a comment I read on reddit a few years ago changed me completely. It said something akin to "You aren't honest if you only say what you're thinking when it's negative. If you think someone looks good, or is doing well, but keep your mouth shut, but you'll comment if they look bad or do something poorly, you're just an asshole".	Constantly. I'm brutally honest and crass. And I can't just let things go. I almost always have to give my two cents on things. Even if I figure out I'm wrong, I keep going. I'm trying to get better about it, but it's a struggle.	1
Ladies, what are some common misconceptions you had before having had sex for the first time that were proven to be untrue?	Definitely changes depending on the guy, but also depends on their mindset. If I'm horny, sometimes my D is ready for round two in like 5-10 minutes. Sometimes, I'm tired and he doesn't want to play. It's sad because you can't force a dick to be hard :/	I assumed semen would just be absorbed by the vagina (like lotion on skin?), rather than sit there and be at the mercy of gravity.	0
What's the funniest thing your pet has ever done?	My two cats regularly stage WWE style cage matches in the bathtub. But the ginger one is often startled by various things like his own tail or the sudden appearance of a kitchen chair that has been in the same position for at least a week, starts to run, forgets where he is in the house and slams headlong into a wall. Then wanders off, sits down and licks his tail like 'I totally meant to do that.'	One of my chickens got stuck in a gate. She thought she could fit through the bars but she was too phat and it was hilariously sad because somehow her wings wrapped around the bars and I was afraid she'd get injured if she exerted herself too much. She could only look at me and her friends with no expression because chickens can't smile or cry. I got her out really carefully and she was fine though.	1
For those of us that never really had nice things, how did you get rid of that feeling of “waiting for the other shoe to drop” when you actually had something nice?	It was a slow, gradual process. When I was a kid I ate gubba'mint cheese and powdered milk. Mom made almost no money (and I think she was bad at personal finance). It took years, some ups and downs, but I got to the point where I realized I saved up for vacations and purchases ahead of time. I have six different whoops/emergency funds. I am going to pay my house off early. I made a great salary. Now and then I'll still find myself doing poor people stuff, tho. Cobbling a ghetto dinner together out of random shit in the fridge because I've mentally calculated the price per meal ... or refusing to buy coffee at home because it's free at work, etc.	The thing is the other shoe is always going to drop. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. You need to just take the moment to appreciate things while they're good and not worry about the things that are bad until they happen. Some planning for misfortune is a good thing, but always worrying about it is not. Nothing stays perfect forever. Trying to exercise control over everything never actually works. Just try to appreciate it when things work out because it's temporary. The problems will show up on their own concentrate your efforts on making the good things happen.	0
What is your guilty pleasure type?	[Claire Underwood](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/85/67/81856743838e17a33d56888df885eb5a.jpg) from House of Cards. She's a psychopath as is her husband and she's like twice my age but good god I find her so freaking sexy. She's also classy as fuck and I pretty much want her entire wardrobe.	There is no type of person I am attracted to that I couldn't bring home to see my parents. Men or women; so long as they're not abusing me, my parents don't care.	1
What's the most awkward conversation you've had with your parents?	My mum decided to tell me about her menstrual cycle throughout her life and then how manapause effected her. Awkies	My mother once asked me to get her weed because she wanted to try it. I didn't smoke weed though. So many awkward questions in my mind that day.	0
Stoic men of reddit, what is something we ladies should know about dating the strong silent type?	Nothin irritates me more than when I go somewhere to sit and have a drink and be with my own thoughts and someone starts with the "you need to smile more! Why are you so quiet!?"	It's an appearance. Strong silent types may or may not stay strong and silent if you actually like talk to them.	1
What is your opinion of Trigger Warnings?	The politically correct side of me thinks that a trigger warning is easy to do and shouldn't be a big deal. But the other side of me thinks that a vast majority of people abuse it, and it casts a bad light on actual PTSD sufferers. Case in point: TW food, TW diet, TW spiders. I mean I don't like moths, but seeing a moth isn't going to ruin my entire day. I think, especially with teenagers, there is a certain vogue surrounding being damaged, and unnecessary trigger warnings allow people to win the Damaged Olympics.	I think it's hilarious how the people who get so offended by them are the ones who are all "if you can't handle it don't go on the internet!!!!1!!!1 2edgy4u".	1
What love story, whether real or fictional, seemed romantic to you at one time but now just seems creepy and/or wrong?	Pretty much every romantic plot line in every teen drama, ever. Kids, you're 15/16 years old. This insane co-dependant lunacy you have going on is good for neither of you. I know it seems, like, SO ROMANTIC but it's not. It's usually kind of obsessive/creepy/manipulative/straight up abusive.	I don't personally agree with this, but a lot of people are outraged about what they consider the rapey nature of the premise for "Passengers". Personally, I liked it and thought it was a solid love story...in the end.	1
How many of you have a female best friend and how has it affected your relationships?	Yup, she's my go-to confidant for a lot of the stuff that happens to me, and we share a lot of common interests. And nope, never fooled around. She's a friend first, basically just one of the guys, not to mention I'm really close to her husband too. I've only been in one real relationship while we've been close. And that girlfriend didn't seem to care at all.	I do. My girlfriend has a problem with it in that she's very flirty, touch/handsy, and doesn't know her well. Edit: just saw your little note. We have in the past. Girlfriend doesn't know the extent, but the way she touches me is enough to not sit well with her.	1
What's the most ridiculous or laughable insult you've ever received?	Three weeks ago I was called looseleaf by a guy. I stood there, perplexed. Finally I asked him what the hell that was suppose to mean. He said, "Because you are white, you know, loose-leaf paper is white." I just died laughing 😂😂😂	Some guy called me a cunt. I'd read the book as a teen (the book by the title of Cunt), plus am not American, so the term has never been offensive to me (and thanks to the book, I know it used to be a word of respect). Up to that point things were getting very heated - as soon as he said that I started genuinely laughing, said thank you and have a good night, and walked away in a good mood while he was left flabbergasted.	1
What do y'all think of girls wearing chokers?	Hipster sluts who tend to pose as feminists on Tumblr tend to wear them alot. Be prepared for some bomb head and a headache.	Not to be trusted. They take them off and they go from super babe goth chick status to wrinkly old crone with a dusty vagina.	0
Just found out my wife is pregnant, now what?	Hey op, I’m not married or have a kid but thinking linearly here’s what I recommend: 1. Check your insurance and gets to see who fits where and what’ll be better to be under to give birth; also check ups and that coverage 2. Schedule appointments/check ups 3. Ask for materials at these checkups on how to prepare Edit: thanks u/silent_boy for this, but for 1., make sure the doctors that see your baby are in your network and not just the hospital; u/Ghostinthesky has a good point on free ultrasounds and recommends checking for some local services to begin this process of searching for care and knowledge on raising kids!	Paternity test. If it is yours, say goodbye to all your hopes and dreams. Don't worry, you will rationalize it as the best thing that ever happened to you. You will be too busy to see how much happier your childless and single friends are, so you never have any reason to question it.	1
Men, what is your go-to when you're feeling depressed?	Meditation and breathing. I still contemplate things as deeply as possible, but remaining grounded in the moment is so much more important to me now. Asking "why" and trying to deconstruct what's making me unhappy can be an endless endeavor if I let it, so staying in the moment via mindfulness turned out to be paramount to letting go of those things and allowing myself to be truly happy.	Do more stuff that scares the shit out of you. Fear is just natural response. Don't shy away from it. Next to that Depression is just your body telling you: "Dude you're supposed to do other things with your life." Conclusion... what you're supposed to do is in that area where you experience fear.	1
Men who bullied gay kids in school...why did you do it?	C'mon guys/gals, don't downvote commenters simply because someone did something in the past. That's not "getting even", that's just being petty.	C'mon guys/gals, don't downvote commenters simply because someone did something in the past. That's not "getting even", that's just being petty.	0
X-post from /r/askmen - What trait did one of your exes have that is now a dealbreaker for future relationships?	Refusing to hold my hand in public. It wasn't because he didn't like PDA. It was because he didn't want people to know we were together.	"Well the wage gap" If the next words aren't "is made up" Bye bye. Actually any of that sort of feminist rhetoric can go away.	1
How often do you get asked out in real life?	It’s sad that the majority of answers are never. But, never. Guys just don’t seem interested in the “date” anymore. It’s sad really.	Actually asked out, like "Can I take you to dinner?" is rare. "Do you wanna hang out sometime?" is less rare but not *often.* Trying to actively hook up with me that night happens *all* the time. Who said romance is dead?	0
Are there women out there who truly believe that victims of rape should be denied the ability to have an abortion? If so, why?	1) religion 2) caring more about your tax rate then the rights of your fellow man edit- try as you may, but downvoting me isn't going to make Romney win Ohio. FACED!	A life is a life even if it is spawned from a terrible deed it should not be punished for that. /end The type of person op is looking for. That view is rarely seen on reddit so I thought I would help you out. =p *fixed a word.	0
Men who were skinny then became muscular and bigger. How would you say your life changed socially after you made your gains?	I've become more muscular, but it only is visible by my actions. I don't *look* strong, but people forget muscle is dense. Since I don't look muscular, everyone still thinks me as just thin.	Socially, I get made fun of for having muscles in a sarcastic way. As far as dating, I am more attractive, but I'm still the same pussy I was when I was skinny. So overall, not really much has changed.?	0
Men who have had the "I have a boyfriend" line pulled on you when you weren't remotely interested in the girl, how'd it go?	"is anybody using this stool?" "I have a boyfriend!!" "Is he using this stool? I'd like to sit with my wife"	Me: "Hi, you are really cute and I'd love to get to know you" Her: "Aww you're so sweet but I have a boyfriend" Me: "Lucky guy! Enjoy each other".	1
Do you ever feel like society swears men don’t have emotions and only women do?How has this effected you?	To be fair, women’s emotions are invalidated constantly. How many times have you seen a woman be called crazy or hysterical?	It does seem that the only two acceptable emotions for a man are happiness and anger. And nobody wants to be around someone who’s angry. I personally deal with this; I’ve held my emotions in for so long, it seems anger is the only one I’m comfortable expressing, so everything that’s not happiness comes out as anger.	0
Parents of Reddit, in what ways has your child(ren) reminded you of yourself when you were their age?	My son is clever but not smart. He lies when it's easy for him to do so and gets him out of work. He listens only when he wants to. He's pulling a ME and he just started school. He's going to be devious, lazy, and quick witted and probably get on the nerves of more than few teachers.	My mum says that her mum used to say "you have an answer to everything" and my mother never knew what she meant by it until I started coming out with answers to everything	0
How well suited would you be to life as a vampire?	I fucking love garlic. Can I consume my human blood while I'm an animal? Morally I would have trouble killing another human being, but I wouldn't mind sneaking into a blood bank or something and having my 25% there. Humans usually die if they lose around 2L of blood, so my 25% would only be 500mL which is only stealing one bag a week. I know blood supply is short, but I guess it's better than actually killing someone. Besides the garlic love and the killing part, I think I'd manage okay.	I have really bad seasonal depression, so I would be the mopiest, emotional vampire ever. Think twilight but so much whinier. Can I take vitamin D supplements as a vampire?	1
What is your favorite way your SO shows you they love you, without saying "I love you"?	He asked me whether I wanted a piece of mango out his fruit shaker. I love mango so yes, obviously! I ate it and he said: "that was also the only piece of mango." I went kind of sad, "you should've said so" to which he replied "no, because then you wouldn't have taken it. But I also can't help saying it's the last piece because your reaction is so funny." He loves me. Big time. I mean, he not only gives me food, but even his only piece of something. On top of that, he knows me extremely well and loves to joke around with me. He also bought me a nutella crepe as a surprise once and only took one small bite himself on his way over to me. He's a keeper. <3 I mean... he's a guy and he gives me his food!	Gently cuddling with me and making out with me. My most cherished example is when she came over to my apartment when I was sick and stayed all weekend, taking care of me until I got better; all I did was to reply to a text saying I couldn't go out as I was not feeling well, and she showed up without me asking for help. This happened 7 months into our relationship; neither of my previous two gf's did anything like this in the combined 3.5 years of dating them.	0
What is the most disgusting thing you've seen on Reddit?	Mostly abject sexual degeneracy: theredpill, people claiming sex with underage people/animals/children/family members is morally ambiguous, some girl who had slept with over 100 men, and some guy who as a fetish got his balls chopped off. I don't know what it is about gross sexual stuff/attitudes that I hate so much but I really do	That guy who defended pedophilia and bragged about raping a 9 year old. Edit: And the ones about Carl H.	0

Why are/were you not ready for a relationship?	I really value my alone time but i’m also clingy. I basically want the other person to fit into my life according to my very specific schedule. I know that’s dumb and unreasonable, so until i figure that out i’d rather be single.	They're just a pain in the ass. You sacrifice your freedom and happiness for the obligation of caring about some jerk and the pressure of their/their families expectations. Who has time for that shit? Particularly since there's plenty of other women my age who are totally down to just bang it out every once in a while with zero pressure for it to be anything beyond that. I'll think about doing a relationship again once I'm in my 30s, and I start meeting women who have been beaten down by the realities of the world enough that their expectations of how much effort I'm willing to put in aren't completely unrealistic.	1
To all the lazy people of AskWomen, what's your favorite easy recipe?	I take a shovel (or spade) and dig several 2'x2' holes in my backyard near the junk pile. Gently sift through the holes with you hands and pick out worms, grubs, and insects. Put them in your pocket, and give them a good whack so they stop their squirming. Then fill the holes with some junk (this isn't necessary but you might as well do something productive) and bury it. Now you have plenty of food in your pocket to munch on throughout the day and your yards got less junk in it.	i do a lot of egg-in-a-hole-s. take a small glass (juice glasses are perfect, but who has juice glasses anymore? shot glasses are just barely too small. champagne flutes often work nicely), "cut" (press) a hole through the bread. spray a pan, heat it up, put the bread in, crack an egg in the middle, add pepper, cook one side. spray what is currently the top, and flip it over. let it cook, add a dash of salt, eat.	0
Pets in bed? Gross or wonderful and the right way to live?	Gross. Maybe it's because I was raised in the country and cats always stayed with the other farm animals, and the dogs in the barn or the wash room, but I think it's just fundimentally wrong to let your pet into your bed. I've softened with the years and I can tolerate pets inside the living room, bath and kitchen, but not in the bedroom, I feel it's filthy and destroys all pegging order in the family. But again, that's just me and undoubtedly has to do with me being raised in an environment where pets serve a purpose beyond companionship.	i have no problem with pets on the bed as long as they don't compromise my comfort. when the dog starts taking up too much space or kicks me while he's dreaming or whatever, he gets the boot.	0
Have you found girls can be pretty laid back about condoms?	I'm always worried in the back of my head about the chicks who say "oh go ahead, no need to use a condom". Unless I know and trust you I'd prefer condom. For me it's about 50%.	My boyfriend was more eager to drop condoms than I was. I've consistently been on the pill for years now and getting pregnant still worries me. I want to possibly get an IUD but I'm worried about potential side effects.	1
What are the best ways to get rid of facial hair like mustaches and peach fuzz?	I get my upper lip hair and eyebrows threaded by a very good-looking Turkish man and swear by it. The first time is quite painful but it gets better after that, your eyebrows will never look sharper and the hair grows in more finely than before.	Anyone have any options for A toddler? She has some hair on her upper lip that is a bit more prominent than I'd like because if medication she is on. Not gonna start waxing but wondering if there is something I can do	1
Do any of you ladies have a job that you enjoy so much, you actually look forward to going to work every day? If you really enjoy your job, what do you do?	I don't look forward to going to work every day. I'm tired a lot, and my job is high stress. But I *love* my job. I love the people I work with, and I love the intellectual challenges of daily activity.	I work at NASA and I train astronauts on biological experimentation techniques which they'll eventually use when they're on the ISS. Yay science! I love my job.	0
What's something people say to make you feel better, but it only makes things worse?	Going out and meeting people or doing social things. Yeah just what I need, more vampires sucking the happy out of what little happy I have at the moment.	plenty of fish in the sea or something of the like after a break up....I don't want another fish. I had the fish I wanted.	0
Guys, how do you feel when a girl approach you and asks you out?	Excuse me? A woman approaching a man? What is this kind of unicorn and where can I find her? I would love it if a woman approached me, just once, ever. But maybe I am ugly :(	If you like the guy, do it. Too many guys would love to be asked by a woman bc many others complain they have to do all the job and read the signals. So, yeah. Go for it.	0
Does it occur to you that many men seem to be terrified of living ordinary, average but comfortable lives? If so, why do you think that is?	I am not terrified of an ordinary, average life.... I am terrified of how quickly it can be taken away from me. &#x200B; Wife Divorces me Co-worker makes an accusation falsely accused &#x200B; Being male in today's world of "you are guilty until proven innocent" if you are male. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;	For me, at least, I think it’s kinda comforting having a normal life. This is also coming from someone who truly loves the people around him. I think that’s what makes it worth it? Like yeah, I wake up and sit at a desk like everybody else, but I have a normal functioning body, a good place to live, a great family and girlfriend. Shit man I like this. Now if I had an overly stressful job, or depression, or a bad family then yeah. I can see how that would suck. But I never found something in my life that made me want to throw it all away and chase that one thing. I’m comfortable and love the people around me, and idk I think that’s a life worth living	0
Guys who have high sex drive but your SO has a low drive, how is it like?	It sucks. One of you will have to make changes. You'll either have to accept fewer sexual encounters or she'll have to try to do more. That is if you stay together.	It will always be up to the higher sex drive partner to "shift it down". You can't make your partner increase her sex drive without it becoming pretty rapey - it's just who they are as a person. Can you be satisfied in a relationship that gives you (considerably?) less sex than you want? Your call to make. My answer would be *nope*. I would end up cheating on her, which is even shittier for both of us.	1
Women with a SO whose culture is vastly different from yours: what were some of your cultural learning curves?	I'm American, he's German. Maybe not a vast cultural difference between us, but from my personal experience, German directness is not a stereotype. If I were thin-skinned we'd have some real problems. Example: One time we were Skyping and he asked me if I had lost weight. I responded, "No, why do you ask?" Him: "Oh, your double chin doesn't look as prominent as it usually does." THANKS BABE	I am a french Canadian from Alberta and he is a Quebecois (they don't refer to themselves as Canadians most of the time so ya). Although we speak the same language, the cultures are VASTLY different. He doesn't see a need to celebrate Canada Day or Thanksgiving. He's much more open with his sexuality and comfortable with PDA's and touching my butt in public....where I grew in a conservative province where those things just aren't done in public! His family is very open in general about things where mine are more reserved. So ya, same background from way before but somewhere along the way the culture changed. I'm more "anglocized" than he is.	1
What's the best NSFW compliment you've ever received?	The first time I went down on my girlfriend her immediate reaction was a genuinely surprised "Oh!" followed by "why are you so good at this?" It felt good.	An older female coworker (she was like 20 years my senior) had a habit of slapping my ass playfully. I like to think it was because she liked my backside.	1
What made you lose physical attraction to a woman?	* Smashing the homies/Lovin the crew or whatever else they call it these days If she's banged any of my friends it's like EEEUGGGGUUGH! * Belly overhang. Hiding them with spanx upsets me. The bikini area is a triangle. If my eyes are on the same plane as her belly button and I can't see the top of that triangle, it's a turn off. You don't have to calculate my hypotenuse. I don't want to have to calculate yours * Turning me down for sex and not initiating after. Rejection fucking hurts.	I was in a relationship with her, it had been a long term relationship. She was unfaithful while I was visiting my family abroad, a trip she refused to join me on. I couldn't look at her again, the thought of the other guy in her just turned my stomach.	0
What was your favorite date that wasn't just getting food with your SO?	We did some trespassing to take photos of run-down buildings. When dusk fell, we watched hundreds of bats fly out of an old barn. It was our second date and still my favorite one.	not sure how "significant" my "SO" is, but he is the guy i've been dating all summer. the best date so far: middle of the day during the week. he left work early (i work from home), brought my favorite food over for lunch (chipotle burrito bowls) then helped me set up my media cabinet from cb2 that had just been delivered. i swooned! the simplest date ever, but it meant a lot to me.	1
What is something you and your SO do that might be considered unique?	My husband reads me bedtime stories sometimes. I tend to stay up till 2am or so when left to my own devices but the reading time heps settle me down a bit. Also he does voices and it's amazing. Right now we're working our way through some of the Discworld books. He's on a work trip right now and still calls each night to read to me, and it's the best.	My hubby and I say “I lima bean you” because I made a ceramic bowl in a heart shape and he asked if it was a lima bean. I even bought him a lima bean with a cute face on it for his bday one year, and painted him a thing that said “I (a picture of two lima beans hugging) you” for Xmas.	1
What's the meanest thing you've done without realizing to someone you liked?	There was a boy that I was really flirty with at school. I was kind of a "late bloomer" in terms of dating compared to my peers, I had bad self esteem and was kind of in disbelief that someone would like me. He asked me on a date and I not even told him no even though I was crushing on him hard, I thought he was making fun of me and I told him no fucking way ew gross fuck the fuck off. And then kicked him in the shins on his way out. Ok no, not the shins part, but that was probably what it felt like. I didn't realize until years later that he was probably genuinely asking and I felt horrible. I hope he's doing alright.	I asked the woman I was dating at the time to marry me over text message. We'd only been together 7 months, so I thought she'd know I was kidding. However, we'd known each other for ten years and already lived together (we were roommates first, maintained separate rooms because I snore), and she thought given all that I wasn't kidding. She said yes and sent me a ;) - I thought she was playing along - and by the next time I got a chance to actually talk to her that evening, she'd already told her parents, etc. Whoops.	1
Guys with objectively attractive partners, what are the downsides of dating someone objectively beautiful?	Even if you’re not the jealous type, men constantly hitting on your partner gets old. Also, as was said earlier, a lot of those girls have little to no personality.	I have to wonder what she saw in me. I’m the most average person and for some reason she actually likes being with me. Others have questioned it as well, like “how the hell did he land her of all people?”	0
Was there a time when you had a feeling, thought you were crazy, and turned out to be right?	Once I felt like a man had followed me onto the subway. I tried to brush away the feelings, sure I was just acting paranoid. When we pulled up to a station a couple stops ahead of mine I pretended to get off just as we pulled up to it. He followed me to the door, so I hopped off the train for a split second and then jumped back on after he had exited. I saw him staring at me as the train pulled away. There's a chance it was nothing, but the look on his face after the door closed was seriously unnerving. I think I might have avoided something very bad that day.	I have had this feeling that the new boyfriend a friend just introduced to me is going to cheat on her 3 times now. (3 different friends, 3 different men / occasions.) And I have always been right. It's weird. And I never know what to do when I have that gut feeling.	1
What are some outdated customs that don’t make sense anymore, but people still follow them simply out of tradition?	Eating meat. Except for people with rare health conditions, you can be completely healthy without eating meat, and it is particularly easy in developed countries where so many foods are available. The environmental destruction caused by meat and animal production causes is beyond belief. But everyone still eats it because that's what they have always done.	this may be just where I live, but most people here are lukewarm Catholics who only baptize their kids out of tradition and so that they will be able to attend Catholic schools which are known to be stricter and more homogenous.	0
What attitude of men you hate the most and why?	Men who act like all women possess the worst qualities of the woman they just broke up with/divorced. I see this in some of the strange reactions I get to things I write. If I say something about crying, then some guy will come along and say something like, "Yeah, but you don't want to see your husband crying," because his last girlfriend was emotional, but didn't allow him to be. Similarly, I see this in the type of men who say divorcing was the best thing they ever did and they'll forever be single. Not every woman is like their ex, but they're so angry they project that out into the world.	Maybe this isn’t considered an “attitude” but for me it’s when a guy knows you’re mad or upset but COMPLETELY disregards the actual reason you are upset and tries to make it into something else. I once saw a meme that summed it up perfectly. It said something like “a guy goes to chick fil-a with his ex girlfriend and when you get mad he goes “how you gonna be mad at me for eating chicken?”And ignores the fact that it’s because he went with his ex girlfriend. I’ve had that shit happen to me so many times. Like they will know I’m mad about X but then try saying why are you mad about Y? It’s infuriating.	0
What's your biggest life struggle right now?	Trying to get a job so my parents don't kick me out. I'm 17 like damn guys. You could have warned me first. I thought I didn't have to work but apparently they've been holding it against me for a while. Wish people could just talk about what's bothering them.	A sense of lostness and lack of direction. Dwindling mental health. And the intense fear that sooner or later i’ll just stay asleep forever or grow bitter. I’m really scared	0
Have you ever rejected someone for what seems like a petty reason but it's something that's really important to you?	I was driving a dude to lunch and as soon as he got in he started changing all my preset radio stations and adjusting the bass and treble. I asked him to stop and he just laughed and kept going. Never again.	I couldn't date a guy once because he was just TOO happy and easy going. One time I cancelled our date because I had to work and he was just TOO accepting. "Oh yeah that's fine, I totally understand, it happens to all of us, it's completely okay, we can reschedule.. and he went on and on" I mean, stuff comes up and plans change, and it's good to be acceptingand flexible, but don't ROLL OVER. It's okay to be a little dissapointed and tell me that. I just couldn't date him.	1
How was your experience with Tinder/Tinder pro?	I see no reason for Pro, even though I am a professional Tinderer. So far it's been great. I've probably met up with over 200+ women from Tinder in the last 3 years. It's great for me because I travel for work, so it makes meeting women in strange cities exceptionally easy. I still do plenty of Tindering, but I've shifted most of my attention to Bumble which is Tinder, but with less trash on it.	Do the free version. Pro just adds more swipes and like an undo option. The free one still gives plenty for you to work with.	0
Have you ever received any backlash for dating someone considered "superior" to you (looks, class, race, personality, etc)? If so, what happened?	I've been married for almost 12 years, and I still often get "THAT's your husband??" when I introduce him to people. Ok yeah, he's a little better looking than me, but I'm not a troll, jeez. Not exciting, but that's pretty much it. Mostly I just make jokes about it.	I don't go after people who are far more attractive than me. If a super pretty girl asked me on a date sincerely I would say no.	1
Have you ever had a good intuition or gut feeling that ended up coming true?	I had a feeling something was wrong in my relationship. Been together for a really long time. Intimacy was lacking, making love had become routine, was sporadic...if at all. Compliments and little gestures of affection had dissapeared. He was protective of his phone...spending more time in the office "working" . I decided to snoop. The password on his computer was changed. WTF? I tried his work laptop, same thing. I tried his phone, same thing. All my bells were going off. I had a computer expert come in and forensically search the computer, it didn't him long to crack the password. I discovered porn, terabytes of it. He was spending up to 9 hours a day surfing the shit. No wonder he kept hand cream on his desk. And the fucking tissues...said his allergies were always bothering him. I learned about porn addiction fast. Thank\-god I listened to my intuition.	I have a happy one! I was 20, in college, and had just started dating a new guy after getting out of a long-term, not very healthy relationship. I was really only looking for a fling, but for some reason I could clearly visualize raising children with this guy. Since marriage and kids were not even on my radar at this point, my response to this was pretty much “what the hell, brain?” Fifteen years later, I’m married to him and we’re raising two kids together. Apparently my brain knew what the hell it was talking about.	0
Do you guys have a bed frame?	It makes me wonder what the rest of your place looks like. It also makes me wonder what your life is like. You probably need to expand your Horizons. There is more to life than what your routine is currently. Learn to appreciate furniture, cooking, camping, something else...before it passes you by. You might want these things later in life and realize the time has gone. You are 26, you're older than you think. Good luck, and change up your stuff.	Trashy is a little much but it is an incomplete setup. It screams bachelor but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.	0
do you have any male friends you would date if they asked?	That's how my husband and I got together. We were very good friends and just always had that spark. Finally got together and it's been wonderful ever since.	No. I don't befriend men I'm interested in. If I'm single, I ask them out, if they're interested we date, if they're not they say "no" and I do not seek a friendship with them. If I'm in a relationship I keep them as only acquaintances, I don't accept invites to things from them and only hang out in group contexts where they are brought along by mutual friends.	1
How much does a girl's friends affect your decision to date her?	female friends I could care less about. Its when a chick has too many dude friends I get turned off.	I don't particularly mind unless they have a friend who really sticks their nose in. I was on track to date this girl but her mate was all "this is my girl" and always checking up on us and shit. Dipped out of that one pretty quick.	0
Guys who enjoy being single: Do you get lonely? What do you like best about being single? What do you dislike the most about it?	What I like most about being single is that I only have to live up to my own expectations and I never do anything I don´t want to do. I look at males I know and the things they do with their girlfriends and I would hate to have to do them. A) Going out to dinner B) Going to the cinema C) Going shopping with her D) Spending time with her family E) Having to pretend to give a shit about her coworkers and what they get up to, nobody cares and if they do tell them and not me. etc etc etc	Sometimes i do get lonely but it's never strong enough to make me think "I wish i had someone". I love living alone, doing what i want, not having to compromise, choosing what or where i eat, when, i love waking up alone, going to sleep alone, i'm just a loner. I really wonder how the fuck i will manage to live with someone in the future. The uncool things are the occasionnal loneliness, the lack of sharing and the lack of human heat.	0
What hobbies in a guy are a total turn-off?	This thread has been locked because apparently people can't read a thread about deal breakers/turn offs without being personally offended that someone wouldn't date them.

Will your life be affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed? How?	Hey folks. I get that the Affordable Care Act is an American law. However, it has enough of an effect on the healthcare industry, which stretches beyond the US borders, that its repeal could easily effect more than Americans. For example, a Canadian or Mexican healthcare worker that sees "health tourism." Due to that, the question stands. Thank you.	Hey folks. I get that the Affordable Care Act is an American law.

What's a product for women you wish existed?	**ITT**: products that do exist; but people just didn't know that they existed, didn't look for them, or couldn't find them. There aught to be a subreddit dedicated to such products full of links to where they can be purchased. Maybe there already is. I wouldn't know. Didn't look.	A device that just sucks your period out of your body. I would love to have it over in a minute	0
Guys that get the feeling that a girl isn't interested, but hasn't gotten a direct response where she says so, what's your approach? Did you ever get a confirmation?	>didn't offer to reschedule. I read that as, "Not interested. Move on." If she was interested AND at able/willing to initiate (both requirements for me), she'd have offered an alternate time or option. Or even invited you to ask after X date. So, either she's uninterested, or expecting you to do all the planning and pursuing. Either way, dude, pass.	Bite the bullet, ask directly. The grey area is the worst, and it's not like asking her is going to reduce her opinion of you. Either she is and was willing, and you succeed, or she isn't and you move on to others. Don't let ambiguity disqualify yourself but equally do not waste time hoping to charm someone who isn't reciprocating.	1
What was your worst "nice guy" experience like?	Was a nice guy, got her out of credit card debt, saved her from an abusive relationship from her family, helped her finance her last year of school fees, all the while she was telling me that when she loved me and was ready to commit to a relationship when she got out of this bullcrap mess. At the end of it, she ghosted me, i sent her 4 angry msgs scolding her for using me and to go fuck herself. 2 months later found myself on a collegehumor post on being “that edgy nice guy”. Thanks life i seen it all now	I had a guy who tried to follow me to Europe and told all our friends we were in a relationship when we weren't. I told him repeatedly that we were never going to be in such a relationship, but it took him almost three years for it to finally sink in. I knew he finally heard what I was saying when I got a nearly incoherent stream of drunken texts from him saying that he's a great guy because he never raped me while I was drunk but also threatening to come over right then to rape me to show me that he's a "real man."	0
What are some Nice Guy™ anthem songs?	Would "Blurred Lines" be a good fit here? The whole concept of 'man knows best' is interwoven through the whole song.	The What Makes You Beautiful song by One Direction popped into my head. "Don't need make-up, to cover up, being the way you are is enough." "You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful." There isn't much more to the lyrics, but this song rubbed me the wrong way. What if I know I'm beautiful? Does that make me ugly?	0
Just watched the Friends episode where Chandler “moves” to Yemen to avoid dating Janice. What’s the most extreme thing you’ve done to avoid an admirer?	I don't have one, probably because that's a childish game to play instead of just communicating your needs like an adult. What I tell women is "I had a great time tonight, and I would like to see you again in the future. Don't be worried if I don't text you tomorrow because I'm really independent, and I really enjoy my own company. Message me when you get home so I know you've made it home okay."	Convinced this girl i was gay. Wasn't so hard as i got my friend to hold my hand in front of her for about a week. She was a wack job	0
What was your most recent deep conversation with your SO about? Did you feel better after?	We talked about our baby timeline last night, but it wasn't super deep. I'm so excited about it. The last deep one we had about us was last week, after an argument that lasted too long and at the end we realized we agreed with each other. We essentially argued for nothing, but that happens to us sometimes. We took a step back to explore why we talk "around" each other sometimes, and why we get so defensive that we miss what the other is *actually* saying in the moment.	Having a child. I thought I felt better, but really we just go in circles. For some context, we’re both fence sitters. I thought we were leaning towards having one, but now I think we’re leaning against. We’ve been talking about this for a year. I just want to pick a side and be done with the conversation. Edit - words	0
I see a lot of posts about bad/creepy interactions with guys. What are your positive/good interactions with them?	One time I was carrying a package into the post office and there were two sets of doors. 4 different guys held the door open for me coming in and out!!! I never even had to touch the door! I felt like such a woman.	Most of my interactions with men are positive and respectful. I have several lovely male coworkers, a lot of my close friends are guys, my neighbors are wonderful, most of my contact with men I do not already know - polite and pleasant. At least 95% of my interactions with men are nice, or at the minimum neutral. For me, it is just that the smaller number of unpleasant encounters stand out more for both their relative rarity and negative impact.	0
Female here. What's the best way to offer to pay on the first date?	I'd say just be able to cover some of the bill it the guy comes up short on cash. Most of us (me included) are too proud to let our S/O pay for their meal because we feel like we have failed to provide. Obviously we don't want you to run up a $200 bill so a guy may ask you to pay your end if the deal. But If you really want to pay the bill just ask before you order your food so He will have a heads up.	Alright so reading your message of a story I'm not going to say anything based off of people's personality bc I honestly have no idea what happened. However if you offer to pay, consider that you have done your part in being a self sufficient adult because you COULD pay for yourself and you have offered to do so. If your offer is declined, say thank you and indulge in the other's kindness. Sure it feels nice to help pay the bill but keep in mind it also makes your date feel nice when they are able to pay for you.	0
Men of reddit who’ve dated or are currently dating a disabled partner (blind, deaf, physically handicapped, etc.) what is it like and how did you start dating?	I used to date a girl in a wheelchair. She was funny, and it was great, we met when we got in a car wreck and I broke her spine.	Not a crazy disability but I dated a girl with a glass eye - she had an infection of some sort as a child and had to have one eye removed. She had some minor difficulties but managed to learn how to drive and all that just fine. She had the best sense of humor about it though. Back in the early 2000’s before emojis we just sent smiley faces like :) and ;) and so on. However she always just used one dot like .) and ,)	0
Tall dudes (&gt;6'0), what are advantages short dudes have that they don't realize?	I'm about the same size as you and I don't have any of the problems you're describing. Neither do any of my 6'-ish weightlifter friends. Though I don't do gymnastics. You need to buy better fitting clothes.	They fit in most modern cars without their heads being on the roof or having to practically lay down to see out the windshield.	0
Men, how much sharing of your sex life by your SO with their friends would upset you?	I have to admit that I get really irritated at women that share intimate details about me with their friends. I just don't understand it as I would personally never share any kind of information about the "bedroom activities". I'm also a very private person, so it might be mostly that. Plus there are some things about me that I feel very insecure about, so the less the lady I'm seeing shares, the better. In my understanding women do this more than men and I personally never understood why. Maybe some of the ladies here could explain why they feel the need to share those intimate details about their sex life with their friends?	Here's what she's sharing: anything that isn't overly embarrassing to her. She's probably sharing just about everything else which is worth mentioning and there's nothing you can really do about it.	1
What baby names do you despise?	Young moms you see on Maury that give their babies names they made up that people probably will have trouble pronouncing. It seems unfair for the kid. My name is normal and I had enough trouble getting teachers to say it right. My roommate's white sister did this with her biracial children. Her youngest is Xiamarah (if I'm spelling it right).	I dislike anything that seems like a fun name for the parent but will be awful or impractical for the kid when they're an adult. Like, Apple is a cute nickname and a cute name for a baby. But, that kid is eventually going to grow up and have to introduce herself as Apple. "Hi, I'm Apple Paltrow" just sounds ridiculous to me. I think too many parents want their kids' names to reflect how cool/quirky/unique *the parent* is and don't think about the fact that a name is usually a lifetime commitment and the kid is a separate person. "My daughter Apple" sounds like a thing a really interesting parent would say. "I'm Apple" doesn't sound like a thing a really interesting person would say.	0
To those with SOs that work long hours and come home tired regularly: what can they do to reassure you they love you?	My bf heats water for my tea when he gets up before me, always comes in to wake me up/say goodbye (depending on my plans for the day) and lastly ALWAYS cuddles me for a couple of minutes when he gets home so we can talk about the day and such	So let me get this straight: The person who works long hard hours and comes home tired is the one responsible for the other persons lack of self-esteem?	1
What would you consider a "green flag" in a relationship?	Something frustrating/annoying/bad happens and she doesn't complain or go to pieces, and lets it go without letting it ruin the day.	ITT: People not understanding the question. "Flags" are not features that have a value of their own, they're indicators of possible presence of features with negative or positive value. In this case, I'd say: Undivorced parents Having a reasonable number (2-4) of close female friends. Pursuit of "caregiving" careers (teacher, doctor, vet, nurse, pedagogue etc.) Limited social media presence Lack of tattoos Involvement in a charity, especially a kind that doesn't yield maximum bang for your buck in terms of bragging rights	1
What skill unrelated to your profession would you want to learn or improve at?	Can we get the mods to just stop adding tags to posts here? Being a mod is supposed to be about supporting the community and the information flow, not soap boxing about your own personal opinions. Yes this is a good question. How is it helpful to the community to have that as a tag on this post?	I would like to learn how to work on cars and motorbikes. Anything mechanical actually. I have a boring ass desk job... Edit: guys thanks so much for the advice, some real good stuff in there and I'll definitely start a project now. Better buy some tools! 👊	0
Why does/doesn't a girl calling you "daddy" bother you?	Dominance. Any guy that claims not to like it is either lying or likes pegging. Edit: please downvote more. I added one.	How often does this happen IRL? I have never encountered it but it seems to come up in conversations on reddit a whole lot. Not sure I would mind, it's pretty naughty.	0
When did you have your first kiss?	It was on my first real date which was a month before my 27th birthday. Edited to include: *LATE BLOOMERS, YOU ARE NOT ALONE*	I was like 19? Turns out kissing is really gross, I'm a bit of a germaphobe, and I never want to do it again 🤷‍♀️	1
Women past child-bearing age: If you never got married or had children when that is what you really wanted, how do you find satisfaction within your life?	I have kids and and find the wording of this question, implying a lack of satisfaction with a woman's life sans motherhood, to be offensive. I do hope that you didn't mean it that way. But even having kids, I find implying that my life's satisfaction revolves around them to be an incredibly limiting and one dimensional idea of me as a human.	ITT: Women upset with the wording. What if she said: Women who really wanted marriage and children but couldn't (for whatever reason), how did you fill that void? It's not that great of wording I guess, but I don't think she's trying to offend you all.	0
You're the main character of the last film you watched--Can you tell me about your story without revealing the movie title?	I grew up on a small farm, and became the first of my kind to be police in the big city. I had to really fight to get respect, and I made some silly rookie mistakes that were blown out of proportion which lead to me quitting the force and going back home, which made my parents happy. I ended up going back to work the case with a petty criminal friend of mine and ended up unwinding the racist conspiracy and became an integral member of the force.	i'm a studious girl who doesn't know how to lighten up, and my boyfriend left me for a beauty pageant winner. now i have to show him and everyone that i can actually be just as good as those types of girls, and i'll stop at nothing to show them all.	1
This morning I heard a guy catcall a woman on a bicycle. He was driving his employer's van. His behaviour disgusts me; should I contact his employer? Or just let this go?	Let it go. It's not your problem and I don't really know what the employer should do. That's just my opinion, it's one of those annoyances that happen.	If you decide to make the call and need to describe what happened, the whistle was probably a "wolf whistle." Just so you're not stuck trying to imitate the whistle at some supervisor who takes the call. :)	0
People who screwed up a relationship with a good partner, what's your story and what would you have changed?	I tried to turn her into a stronger person than she is. She has mental issues and I'm learning about Dom/sub life. It isn't just in the bedroom. It's every part of a couples life. The Dom makes important choices for the sub. Not a controlling asshole, which I don't want to be, but love based. The Dom gets fulfillment. Which I did. I think like a parent does whats best for a child. I tried to make her independent. She is not. She even commented once that she needs someone, like me to tell her things. I miss her.	My first "normal" relationship. She lifted me up. Raised my self esteem. So much that I began to get interest from other women. I broke up with her to pursue others... She met someone else pretty quickly, got pregnant, married, etc, as did I, but I shouldn't have hurt her like I did.	0
Has anyone taken '23 and me' or other DNA ancestry test? How accurate was it and what did you find out that surprised you?	My older half brother (given up for adoption) was able to get in contact with us because he took the Ancestry.com one. It somehow matched him with my great aunt who figured out who he was and put him in contact with my dad. It was a pretty cool day when (with permission) he and his family turned up on my parents' doorstep	23andme’s business model is taking your dna and selling it to anyone who wants access to it. Think about the implications. The profit is not from finding out ancestry it’ll come later when they have one of the most important information databases in the world. when you sign up for their services, inside the fine print you sign away all your rights to your dna and give them the right to sell it to third parties	1
What TV show (past or present) do you think is extremely underappreciated? What makes it so good in your opinion?	A lot of people on the internet like Pushing Daisies, but nobody who I talk to in reality has heard of it, even fans of Hannibal (same creator). It's a show about a piemaker who can raise the dead by touching them and kill them again with another touch. If he lets them live, someone else dies. He uses this power to solve crimes. For such a morbid premise, it's a really upbeat show. And visually stunning.	The Mindy Project. I know people mostly know about it, but it is perennially underrated. It is the only show that can make me laugh out loud. Every character- Mindy, Jeremy, Morgan, Peter, Jodi- is hilarious. If you haven't watched it yet, I *highly* recommend you start. Edit: My guilty pleasure is Young & Hungry. I'm embarrassed to admit that I watch it, but it's just such a feel-good show!	1
Men who explore abandoned buildings and other locations. What’s the craziest/scariest thing you’ve stumbled upon?	Some homeless dwellings. Few times when the "owner" was there (mostly very friendly when showed respect). Weird dolls and graffiti in an abandoned Asylum, but it was a popular spot so we expected other visitors to put them there. Nothing that scary or crazy. Cities are actually very safe unless you get shot. Which is still rare.	Came across some gang members in an abandoned warehouse. They had fire in their eyes and their words were very clear. They're out to get me, I knew i should leave I can but I didn't want to be a boy I wanted to be a man. I wanted to stay alive, better do what i can. I wanted to show them that I was'n't really scared but I was playing with my life it wasn't a game of truth or dare, but I wanted to be bad.	1
Where were you at the beginning of the decade, and where are you now?	At the beginning of the decade, I was a high school junior and turned 17 about two and a half weeks in. I am now a college graduate, with a BA in political science and currently in the process of applying for grad school online. I still live at home and don't have a job yet, but I'm OK with that. I don't want to spread myself any thinner than I have to at this moment in my life.	I was 10 living in my parent's house without a job Now I'm 20 living in my parent's house without a job	0
I'm 22 years old. If you were 22 again, what would you do differently?	Take that hot girl with the sparkle eyes who was just that chill and marry her, so I could dominate her daily while we were still young, and force her hips to squirt out the children our bodies were designed to be parenting at that age. Staying up all night sucks when you get to your mid-thirties, not to mention the increased risk of genetic deformity. Money is over-rated, items and "friends" are overrated. Do it like your grandparents and their grandparents and their grandparents, like your body was created to do. Have them early, and often, and tell "the world" to shove their judgement up their empty heads. They got plenty of space in the empty bank in their chests.	"take college seriously and do not drop out" *7 upvotes* "take college less seriously and improve my social life" *7 upvotes* hmmm	0
I'm a Big Sister! Trying to find fun things to do with my Little, a 13 year old girl - any suggestions?	Is she girly? Are you? Cool girl stuff I totally would have wanted to learn at 13: * How to sew a dress * How to do a bunch of different braids * How to make those cool friendship bracelets with the beads and shit * How to apply makeup (cos maaaaakeovers & selfies!) * Various nail art techniques (dots, stripes, pictures, textures)	Could you cook a fun, healthy meal together? I don't know what your little's family's situation is but my mom mentors a high school student and they often go out for lunch—when they started and the student picked the location it would always be fast food places because that's what she was used to, but my mom's taken her to some more adventurous, healthy restaurants that the girl has really enjoyed. Cooking something could be an "activity" version of that maybe, and I feel like 13 is probably a good age for it.	0
What are the actual steps that happen between meeting someone and having casual sex?	Don't talk to her like a friend from the beggining be charming Funny confident tease tease her If you want sex you have to portray that in yourself Think how girls make themselves look sexy You have to do the male version of that You attract what you put out always If you want sex make it obvious you don't want anything else If you want it to be casual then you can't let emotions feelings life troubles get into your head you have to be confident trustworthy etc Make yourself into a guy girls want to bang	> what's the "one-thing-led-to-another" part? Both parties send signals, one of them escalates things with physical contact like touching a hand or leg and then, if the other party doesn't reject that offer, moves on to kissing and eventually foreplay. Sometimes things can be kind of blurry even after all that in which case I'll ask how far she wants to take things. I'd assume that movies and pop culture tend to skip these steps because showing an hour of flirting, making out and touching would be boring.	0
Previous owners of lusciously long hair: what has been the reaction to your *very* short haircuts?	When I was dating my ex, I had a short bob. He saw some old pictures of me with waist-long hair and hinted that he'd like me to grow it out... and I hinted that he could go fuck himself. A few days later his mom said "I was surprised when we met, because my son usually prefers girls with long hair". I replied "well, he can go date one of them, then" and that was the end of it.	I went from long, luxurious curls to a 1/4" buzz cut. Women were generally surprised, but liked it. Men were overwhelmingly *angry*. "Are you a lesbian now?" "*Someone's* got issues." "Your boyfriend let you do that?" "What, are you some kind of angry feminist or something?" One asshole grabbed my arm and checked for track marks. My SO is the one who made sure my shaves were even all over, and I kept the same job I've had forever, so no impact there aside from the drug test.	0
I'm having a hard time finding a job. What did you do when you had a hard time finding a job?	Oof. Yeah, I've been there. My last job I got after sending out 155 applications. My current job I got after sending out 63. Nothing pissed me off more than people with jobs telling me to hang in there because I'd find something, but now that I'm on the other side, there's nothing else *to* say. Job hunting sucks balls, there's no getting around it. But no one, except for dead people, is jobless forever.	From my experience, being picky lowers your chance of getting a job. It's not about preference. So long as you can pay your bills with the job, you gucci	1
All right now, how often do you wash not-every-time items?	I am so foul that I don't even have a schedule. Just whenever I look at it and think, "Man, when's the last time this was WASHED?" And then I wash it. Towels and sheets get done the most out of your list. I never wash shoes. I need to be more on my bra washing game, it's kind of ridiculous.	I'll start. Towels once every week, sometimes two. Sheets about once a month. Pillows, I never wash mine but my husband's needs to be fluffed a couple times a week. I have never washed shoes unless they've been puked on. I wash my bras when they get especially dirty, usually every month or two. Almost never wash bathrobes, but we don't usually wear them much. Almost never wash other blankets unless there are visible stains. I live with my husband.	1
What is something you want in a relationship that is politically incorrect to say that you want?	Holy shit this thread is awful. It's just Reddit circlejerking against political correctness and getting mad about things not being politically correct when in reality no one gives a shit.	I just want to date someone who is mentally healthy. Almost every girl I've dated has complained constantly about her crippling anxiety/body dysmorphia/depression, etc. I understand that everyone has their own demons to wrestle and I feel bad for saying it. I really would enjoy the company of someone who is stable and consistent though.	0
Have you ever fooled around or had sex with a guy friend? How did you relationship change?	I had this guy chase me all through high school. We became pretty inseparable and although I knew he probably had feelings I kinda ignored them and put him in the friend zone. However, even after high school he still clung on. After my first serious breakup, I decided to throw him a bone for all his years of faithfulness. I also knew it would be the kiss of death for our friendship. The sex was really good and it was exactly what I needed, a "friend" to help me move on from a really bad breakup, but he finally moved on too. I just think as a woman you should always be in charge and aware of the sexual environment. Like I totally KNEW once I gave him what he wanted for years, it'd be easy to get rid of him. Kinda fucked up, but I'm cold like that.	My current SO was my guy friend i fooled around with. We decided to be FWB, then "exclusive" FWB then said fuck it let's just get together.	0
What preconceptions did you have about men which you later learnt weren't true?	The first time I saw a penis in real life (my current boyfriend) I had no idea what a "grower" was, or that they even existed. So my reaction in my head went from "It's not that big but that's ok" to "OH OK NEVERMIND".	1. That a guy could want a marriage more than I do! (my current situation right now). I used to think all of them didn't want to settle down, be a bachelor forever, etc. 2. That ALL of them grow overwhelming chest/back/leg/butt hair after a certain age (not the case at all) 3. That they're terrible cooks, excluding "professional chefs" of course... see above. Probably reinforced by my local culture, where men don't really cook at all. 4. That a man could be into shoes/fashion more than any woman I know (that's my brother) 5. That they are all more assertive/less introverted than me. However, all the guys I've liked were far more shy than I am!	1
What is the best most mind blowing comment that girl made towards you that made your think more of yourself?	When I was going through a divorce, my ex's brother's wife came over to me at a family function, "You're such a good man, she didn't deserve you." I said thank you and just as I was about to walk away, she goes, "Your kids are very lucky, I should've married you". I was taken aback a bit, I was speechless. Needless to say, that was about 10 yrs ago and now they're going through a divorce.	Ex gf to other ex gf in my car "did you guys have amazing sex, because we did" saw other ex gf fb msgs, and she describes to her friend "spore2012 is amaaaaaazing in bed". So i got that going for me, which is nice.	1
Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? How common are compliments about your appearance, fished or otherwise?	I get compliments about my hair all the time...... mostly from elderly women, never girls my age (I'm 22). I never fish for compliments, as I'm very self-deprecating.	> Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? Not counting girlfriend compliments: Last Thursday, from a business associate. > How common are compliments about your appearance? Much more common than Reddit or AskMen would have you believe.	1
What have you learned from AskMen this year?	A lot of you overthink how to talk to women. A lot of you overthink how to talk to people in general. It's not fucking hard, and the fact that you think it's hard to the point where you go into an online forum and ask for advice makes me question where the world will be in 20-40 years. Logically, this means a lot of you are anti-social loners, which is pretty sad but also makes me feel better about myself, considering I don't lack social skills with people and women.	That a lot of women really really want to ask that one guy out and absolutely would if only they had some balls. Truly, they try so hard despite their disability.	0
Do you feel comfortable giving ''instructions'' to a guy when he performs oral sex to you?	Yes, it's important to me, and yes, I communicate with my partner when I have sex because I'm an adult and that's what adults do.	Like, the very first time? No, I usually just feel him out to see how he does it. After that, assuming he didn't get me off the first time? Absolutely.	0
What should every man experience by the time he is 30?	Travel alone once. It can seem daunting and lonely, but my solo trip to Thailand was so amazing. Even traveling with 1 other person, you have to take in account what they want to do, what they want to eat, but alone? You do whatever the fuck you want. Wanna stuff your face with local cuisine and then get a massage and pass the fuck out? Do it. Someone tells you about this cool island with little monkeys and crazy night parties? Go. Nothing holds you back except yourself. Also, meeting people at Hostels is so much fun, I never really felt lonely.	* Having sex with a married woman * Moving somewhere with no safety net, no one to bail you out if you don't make that place home * Getting shot and surviving * Challenging the way things are at a job you could afford to lose, especially if you challenging that thing makes the company more efficient. * Live in a loft in a nice city, and throw a big party when you move out. * Travel cross country on a rode trip, or a greyhound (once is enough if you choose the greyhound route) * Travel alone, and don't plan anything before hand I'm sure I have more but these are just things from personal experience that will change and shape you, hopefully you learn the right lessons from all of them.	1
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO, for reasons that were out of their control?	The first part of the relationship was great. He's hilarious, spontaneous, smart, and fun. But once we had dated for a few months I realized he didn't know how to relax. In our relationship or just in life. He didn't know how to hang out. If he came over, I had to be "on" the whole time, entertaining him. If I didn't have a plan for the day or just wanted to chill, he would suddenly remember all the things on his to-do list, start making excuses, and leave. He was great at parties, but the lack of one-on-one time made me feel really distanced from him. So my brain started reassessing and my attraction took a nose dive. I still think he's an amazing person though. We just weren't great for each other.	What are some examples of reasons out of their control? (Just want to make sure I am understanding the question as intended)	1
what’s the cutest thing your girlfriend or wife does that the world should know about?

What’s one thing you’ve learned about men that has saved you a lot of stress ?	Because a lot of people seem to be confused: **This is not an advice thread.** (This is not an advice subreddit.) The users here are answering /u/uh-bye-bye's question with their personal experiences. There is no need for you to respond to their comments to tell them that they're wrong (invalidation) or to tell them how your personal experience is the opposite of theirs (derailing).

How common is it to have sex on the third date?	Depends on where you live. Here in Norway its pretty common to have sex first, then go on a date if you like each other.	I think people have sex by the third date; it provides a decent baseline. If she isn't going to have sex with you by date three, you can probably assume that she isn't that interested in you and is stringing you along for free food and attention. It provides a more solid line to cut someone off by. Similarly, if men cannot commit to three dates even for sex, then he is probably not that interested in a real relationship. Again, a useful thing to measure by.	1
Ladies of Reddit, what's a douchey thing that guys do but we don't realize we are doing it?	Singing 'girly' karaoke songs as a joke. It's not funny when women sing songs written by men and it's sexist and "douchey" to think it's funny in reverse. "So I put my hands up they're playing my song"	Complimenting me by putting down other women. Especially if it's by putting down *all other women*. Dude I can guarantee that I am not the ONLY woman who [anything].	0
How to tell a close mate that bringing his girlfriend to every guy's event is starting to piss off the group just a little?	In my experience, after the “ guys only “ conversation, you will just start seeing less and less of him. He will drift away from the group to hang with his girl. It happens in every group of guys.	Hey, bud. I'm telling you straight as a friend should: Look around. No one else is bringing a date to these get-togethers. If you can't come solo, don't show up. It's "Guys' Night". You're pissing off the entire group.	1
What embarrassing thing did you do and hope no one will ever find out?	I tell people I got into martial arts and boxing because when I was 11 I was beat up by two 16 year old kids. Great sob story, yadda yadda. I leave out the fact that I literally pissed my pants during that incident and the sheer embarrassment of wetting myself has driven me all these years.	A few years ago I was working as an architect on an 80 year old local state monument and accidentally gave George Washington crossed eyes due to a screw up in the schematics. I had been working late and I was on the verge of finishing the design, or upkeep to be specific, and emailed them before double checking them. Unfortunately, my boss caught on and was furious but tried to contain her rage before she pulled me into her office and, with the fury of God she yells, "In nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table!"	1
Ladies who checkout r/askmen. How do you feel about most of the posts about guys being insecure?	It validated what I learned far too late in life and helped me treat the men in my life with more care. I honestly didn't really know anything about the "fragile male ego" until almost my 30s and instead held onto this concept of the John Wayne type of man. (Perhaps influenced by a father who loves me deeply but in that John Wayne type of way.) So I am thankful for the insight, because it has inspired me to take better care of the men in my life, to offer non-judgmental space, to compliment them often and sincerely and to be a better friend. So I am grateful.	It's kind of refreshing to see that everyone has insecurities. I was really close to my brother growing up so my perception of men didn't change too much; I already knew they have insecurities just like everyone else.	0
What do you truly regret from your 20s?	I am only 21 and I already regret not going out and party while I'm still young. But honestly I can't really be bothered. Still regret it though.	Not standing up to people/being neutral. If I felt someone was being mean, and I didn't say anything except rolling my eyes. If I saw someone in a sticky situation at a bar and didn't intervene bc "none of my business". Every time Ice stood back and done nothing I regret it. I'd rather look mental and stand up for what I believe is right, than to let things slide.	0
What's your more creative date ideas?	Last time I went on a first date with a girl, we went to the natural history museum of my city. It seemed like a good idea because there's plenty of things to look at (and to talk about) and since it's a museum, you can't talk out loud so you have to get close to each other. The date went really well and I plan to go back next time I have a date. Of course, it all depends on you both, some would find it really boring.	I honestly dont even know how to meet interesting women at my own age so I have no idea about proper dates either. 28 single, and at this rate I will die alone.	1
"Easy A" or "Mean Girls"?	I've never seen Easy A but I feel like I'm the only person in the world that doesn't love Mean Girls. I mean, it was cute and all but...meh.	How is this even a question? Mean Girls is the only correct answer. Easy A is funny but it's no Mean Girls.	0
What's that one super embarrassing thing you did that keeps you up at 1am cringing about it years later?	I was a new boss and had to fire an employee for the first time. She packed her bag, cleaned out her desk and I followed her to the door. And I said ... "See you later". It was just a habit. The way she looked at me ... I still cringe so hard thinking about it.	I won best dressed at prom.. I said thank you all for voting for me because I was so shocked that my class did that and I was very unpopular then and spoke to no one and the "late chick" during my school days. Edit: I would like to make it clear that I was an awkward teenager and didn't expect this and didn't know what to say and I had said it as though I'm the prettiest girl in the world because I do not know what to say at that moment. I still cringe at this moment.	1
Has a gay guy ever been sexist towards you? And how?	I worked with a guy that said many fatphobic things (like literally saying fat people are bad people) and that gay men cannot sexually harass women because they are gay. He said he could go up to a woman and grope her and it would not count as sexual harassment. I was told to accept his comments because “it’s different in the gay community.”	Yes! I went to a gay bar for my 27th birthday because it's something I've always wanted to do. Had the time of my life! Went to the bar to order a drink and a gay guy came right beside me, spoke to the bartender, and said "oh I've got her drink! She'll have a sex on a beach! Did I guess that right?!" NO! Not every girl enjoys cocktails...I just wanted a beer. To me, this was pretty sexist. He did apologize and gave me a hug, so it wasn't a big deal. But that's the only time I can think of.	1
[NSFW] What are the best and worst one-night stands you've ever been had?	Best: PCB Spring Break 2007. I was a sophomore, I went with my frat, we were packed in like 10 guys per condo. Met a girl who had a family beach house there, and was staying with her friends. We fucked all the time, did a lot of drugs and had a fucking blast. MTV was there and blew the fucking roof of the place with some sick concerts/big acts. Worst: We both got nearly simultaneous diarrhea from eating some tainted icepops from some ice cream vendor cart. She only one bathroom so I used the toilet while she used the shower. This went on for what seemed like an hour until I could shower the filth off, roll home and spend the next few days mainlining gatorade and saltines.	Met a girl at an Abercrombie party for employees. My cousin was the manager. 5mins after meeting and complementing her thing, we went in the bathroom and preceeded to get it on! Quickest one night stand ever. I hate that moment because 99.9% if the time it's not that easy. I also think it depends on where you are looking. I live in LA. The social game rules here are far different than anywhere else.	1
What is a white lie that blew up on you?	Was staying at my MIL's house. Took her clothes out of the dryer to do my own laundry and put them back in when I was done. She later asked me if I did laundry and I said no. She called me out because the settings on the wash were different than what she usually uses. Said she felt "lied to" and now makes it very obvious that she no longer trusts or likes me. I never thought I'd be the SO that a MIL hated.... but I made it.... because I lied about doing laundry.	I often tell people I don't have a smart phone if they ask me to download an app or use navigation on my phone or something. This happened at a work conference and my manager got irritated when he saw me using my phone later, after I told him "I don't have a smartphone" as a reason I didn't download the conference app. Yes, I do have a smart phone. Unfortunately, it's a Windows phone, and most apps don't even bother making a Windows OS version of their app, so I can't use them. But explaining that to people is a pain in the ass so it's easier to just say I don't have a smart phone.	0
How's your new relationship working out, guys?	It's okay. We get along really well. She's not nearly as good looking as past gfs however. I'm hoping it's not a problem later...	Not sure if this counts as new. Me and my high school sweetheart got back together back in April after not seeing each other for almost 4 years but we dated all of high school. It's absolutely amazing. I was head over heels in love with her and never got over her. We both didn't date anyone in college because we both loved each other too much. It's so nice to be in her life and everything feels right again.	0
What's your favorite psychological theory or phenomenon?	The greater the inequality in laws toward women and the less women are allowed to participate in public life, the worse the male collective behaves internationally: everyone suffers. This is both psychological and anthropological.	I can't really explain why but object permanence (or a baby's lack thereof) always makes me giggle. I just picture a baby playing peekaboo going "oh my god mom no!"	0
If YOU could choose how you were going to be proposed to, how would you want it to happen?	No slow buildup. I don't get those proposals that are just an entire fun day that ends with a proposal. Everytime someone shares one of those stories, they're playing coy and pretending they didnt know it was coming... but it's totally obvious that it was happen. Had a friend and her boyfriend both tell me the date they were going to get engaged, later that weekend when she's sharing the story, she's trying to make it sound like a surprise, but it obviously wasn't. Ideally, I'd like a "y'know we're going to marry each other, right?" "oh yeah, of course." *pulls ring out* "wanna make it official?" OR something superficially horrible to happen, like falling in mud, before the proposal.	On top of a mountain, hiking. Or after a thunderstorm in the middle of the grasslands. It sounds specific but we have been in that situation before and it was incredibly romantic. It's my favorite photo of us :)	0
Is it irrational that this annoys me?	I would find it very disrespectful. My guy friends know that if I bring along one of my girl friends, they can flirt, exchange numbers, plan followup events, but they do not take that girl home. It's obvious that hooking up would cause an awkward situation for me and my friends respect that. Maybe you should talk to the guys and set up some rules? That's what I had to do. It's been working amazingly ever since; however, I'm also very picky about what girls I take out with me.	Your male and female friends are adults and they can do what they like. If they want to hook up or do anything then you don't really have a say in it. That being said it is annoying as fuck when you have friends who put you in the middle of their relationship and pump you for information, or involve you in their casual hook-up drama.	0
What do you eat for breakfast that keeps you feeling full until lunchtime?	I eat a steak, maybe yogurt and maybe veggies as well as coffee. It keeps me full till breakfast the next day. I also only eat once a day	Breakfast burritos made and frozen ahead of time. Pop in the microwave for 2 mins and I can scarf it down in no time. Made with scrambled eggs, salsa and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. Then a giant cup of coffee when I get to work.	0
Redditors who just ended a long term relationship, and redditors who just got into one after a long period of singleness, what was the most striking change for you?	Ended a 8 year relationship half a year ago. The thing that hit me the hardest is the lack of that someone you'd talk to and just hang around with when you get home after work. Coming home to an empty home after so much time together is really... odd. Still not used to it.	My boyfriend of 6 months (not long term at all, but it was still significant) and I broke up almost 3 months ago. I think the hardest part was not hearing his voice anymore. Like clockwork, everyday when he'd get out of work he'd call me. We'd talk about our day while he was walking home from work, and those 20 minutes became the highlight of my day. Even if we didn't talk about anything in particular, it was nice having that little routine. I also recently got into the genre of music he loved, and it's hard not being about to text him about a cool song I heard.	1
If your wife was going away for the weekend, and you had the house to yourself for three days what would you do?	Play video games and eat rubbish for 2 days. Then regret not tidying up after myself so on the final day panic tidy the house.	Nothing different, because my live-in-girlfriend doesn't control my fucking life. If your girlfriend or wife DOES control your life, you need to get your fucking balls back and remind her that relationships are two-way, not all about her.	1
What are the most ridiculous "negs" you've received from guys trying to sleep with you?	"I don't really like redheads. I'll make an exception for you, though, because I like your boobs well enough to overlook your red hair." Noped right out of there.	"You seem great, I can't figure out why no one has taken you off the market yet" Uhh that's because I *am* great and I haven't found anyone worthy of "taking me off the market" yet.	1
Men of Reddit - How often do you receive compliments from your SO/women in general? And what might those compliments be? Does this affect you in any way?	My wife and I have been together for 11-ish years. Last night she said I was hilarious, and it's the first time I can remember her genuinely complimenting me in a long, long time. It made me feel better than I'd care to admit.	I get being cute a lot, I like it for sure, but I want to be the hot guy! Cute is for puppies :P	1
What is your favorite physical attribute?	My hair. It's naturally three toned. It's thick and silky and lustrous. It sucks in the summer, but no one ever said being fabulous is easy.	The fact that such forces as gravity, inertia, and friction act upon me. Life would be rather difficult if they didn't.	1
What is the creepiest "I stalked your Facebook" story you've heard?	I went to a concert alone and spent the evening sitting at a table by myself. Didn't speak to a soul. Went home to a Facebook message (from a stranger) along the lines of "I saw you at the show tonight." NOPE.	In college MySpace was a thing. Huge. So all the students were on MySpace and I think I had a lot of ransoms added. One day a guy messaged me that he saw me in the school restaurant area. Turns out his apt wasn’t too far from mine too (same complex)	1
What's your worst experience after becoming emotionally invested in someone you thought felt the same way for you?	I told a girlfriend what I'd been through and opened up to her after a month of her pestering me to "open up." This was c. 2016 when it was 'trendy' to have guys suddenly spill open all their feelings of sunshine and rainbows. I finally let her know I'd been struggling with anxiety at my new job and how worried I was about the huge gamble we'd taken moving so far from where we'd graduated. "I think less of you for that" were the first words out of her mouth. I dumped her on the spot, and that has been difficult to get over.	ITT: The pussyfication of men in the 21st century. Not a jab at the men here, but these stories (as I have plenty of my own) are a real bad consequence of what we have been spoonfed by Disney, feminism and cultural marxists. If you can't see it, then you are fooling yourself. Men are weak because we lack strong examples, masculinity has been demonized and termed " toxic ". These stories are all natural consequences of men trying to tame their masculinity and turning into little girls in the process. We are turning into penis having little girls and it's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.	1
What are your bad online dating stories?	One time a guy told me the next day that he has a wife and two kids but they're only together for the kids and both date separate people. Yeah okay. Also, he gave me a didgeridoo that he carved, on our first and only date.	Finally met her after talking for forever. Made out on the first date. Smashed on the second and third. Really got down on the fourth. Called things off by the fourth month because she seemed to only be interested in non-monogamy. Yea, that's about all i got. Really fucking fell for this woman. Have a real hard time getting over it.	1
How many of you got shafted on father's day?	Sounds like the mother in the house made her expectations clear. Did you also make your expectations clear? Did you state that you expected breakfast in bed? Or did you just kinda shrug and go "I don't care" and then get pissy when people treated it as something you didn't care about?	At my work, on mother's day weekend they sent out a nice email, bought us pizza both days and gave a flower to each mother on shift for mothers day. This weekend there was no email, no pizza, nothing at all. I thought that was pretty fucked up.	0
Ladies, do any of you suffer from Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder, for lack of a better term? Does sunny weather depress you?	Thought you might appreciate [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnjZNJyDc7NZiZG/giphy.gif) :) I am just like you. Sunny weather gets me angry, depressed and I feel super worthless. Yesterday was the perfect day in my city: cold, dark and rainy all day. It felt amazing. Today the sun is out and it's so hot. I am definitely looking forward to autumn and winter.	I wouldn't say I get depressed, but the summer is extremely hard on me. My lupus is worsened by sunlight and heat so I tend to spend the summer indoors more. I also go through a lot more flare ups during the summer, and most of my hospitalizations happen in the summer months. I would much prefer it stay fall/winter all year.	1
Women who have become pregnant while on birth control, what is your experience?	I got pregnant on the pill. Tri-Sprintec. Took it every day but not at the same time everyday so maybe that's where I messed up? Anyways I have the most amazing little girl I could ever ask for! Now I have the Mirena! Much better for me.	Oh my god why did I read this thread. I'm now convinced I'm pregnant and I haven't had sex in at least three months	0
Women, what sexual act are you too embarassed/shy or weirded out by to ask your ao to try out and why?	Everyone, this thread is about sexual acts commenters are too embarrassed/shy to ask for, not how their answers aren't that big of a deal because doing it personally turns you on.	Everyone, this thread is about sexual acts commenters are too embarrassed/shy to ask for, not how their answers aren't that big of a deal because doing it personally turns you on.	0
What is the riskiest wank you've ever had?	Jerking off inside a filthy port-a-potty, in Balad, Iraq, to an AAFES catalog, in 130 degree heat, during a mortar attack. I was a horny, sex deprived 19 year-old and thought my scrotum was going to explode if I didn't bust a nut. Mission accomplished.	On a public transit light rail train. I was late and there were only a few people on it, but I had it all out of my pants. Young me was a mix of ballsy and really stupid.	1
What's your last minute Halloween costume?	Not for all audiences: Poke holes in a trash bag an wear it like a shirt, then tie a piece of garden hose around your waist. You're a hose bag.	Take a page out of the office and cut out 3 circles of black construction paper and attach to yourself and say you are "3 hole punched such and such".	0
How did you manage to screw up a date you were on?	I paid with a gift certificate. This was before the more acceptable gift cards that look like credit cards. I didn’t tell her but I got the gift certificate by complaining about my service on a previous visit. Maybe this girl just didn’t like me but I attributed it to the gift certificate. She was cute too and had big boobs.	Asked a girl on date and we went to the boat show that was in town. We're looking at this huge yacht and she went down the ladder first. I went down the ladder after her and slipped on a rung. I kicked her right in the jaw and knocked her out. Medics came and got her. Never talked to her again.	0
What was your "wow, I really don't give a fuck anymore" moment?	Mine is going to be boring, because this is reddit, and reddit is flooded with trans women, but when I realized I could never fit cis-norms and said, eh, whatevs. Not that this fixes physical dysphorias, it doesn't, but it certainly makes going out the door easier when I don't care if you know I'm trans or not. And honestly, I've come to like (love?) being trans because as a gender pariah, I have the freedom of a pariah. I'm damned either way, so I might as well choose my personal happiness 100% then - not a freedom many have in life.	I watch a lot of movies (>3 a month). Before I used to make plans to see them with people. It was such a fucking hassle and people kept showing up late but its a big fucking deal for a 2-2.5 hour movie. So i stopped asking people and started going to movies by myself. One of the weirdest best decisions i ever made. Super liberating, i enjoy myself more, i can go anytime and get on with my day.	0
I hear a lot about women who never have experienced an orgasm during sex. Are there any men out there with the same issue?	I think you just need the right girl and to feel relaxed. Find one who can have vaginal orgasms fairly easily. She'll be well lubrucated and the fact that she's very obviously getting hers will boost majorly your confidence.	Happened to me the first 4 or 5 times me and my ex had sex. Fun for a while because I could just go until she finished. Eventually the more comfortable I became with her and our sex life I started finishing consistently	0
Who gave you the best blowjob(s) of your life, and what was the secret of their technique?	I'm lucky enough to say it's the woman I'm currently dating. I don't know the specifics of what she does, but I would say one thing that really helps is she eased my guilt of just receiving pleasure by making it clear she's there because she wants to be/enjoys doing it.	I don’t know if this counts, but for me it was a slut off of Tinder that was into really rough sex and wanted to be hurt. She would take the roughest oral sex I could give. Like rougher than you see on porn sites. I can tell you, It is something worth having.	1
Do you think it's possible to be in a room full of food and through sheer force of will and self-control not eat anything until you die?	I think some people may be able to pull it off, probably through intense meditation or some other method, but I don't think I or the average person could resist once actual starvation kicks in.	Absolutely not. Free will is only affects the rational part of your mind, and when push comes to shove thats actually a rather small and weak part.	1
How do I get past not caring about my wife’s day?	Maybe you’re just too young son so let an old hand introduce you to this magical skit from Chris Rock who drops knowledge on us about how to deal with “how was your day?”. [How was your day](https://youtu.be/HQaLYD6E9Wk)	Fake it, my wife has this thing where if she has had a horrible day, she just gets home and blows me. So I am interested till I hear positivity. If it's bad though she will be all "Can I talk to you", and go to bedroom or close bathroom door and start grabbing at my pants while saying "that bitch Tina called off again and somehow is still employed". I was very disappointed in Tina's firing	1
AW, has an ex ever reached out to you years later? How did it go? What is your relationship like currently?	My ex reached out to me and we've been back together going on 7 years and 3years marriage. We've been off and on for about 19 years but still going strong and in love 😍. Marriage, relationships are hard you have every type of everything coming y'all's way especially when it's strong 💪🏼. Sometimes I feel like wow 😳 really, and then I feel like yes we're going to be alright. It's a lot of patience and dedication and the main thing loyalty. We couldn't of done it without our grand creator God ☺️	It was an amicable breakup and we now email catch up every few months, but I haven't seen him since. We invested a lot of time in one another so it's nice to learn how the other is turning out. We dated about 8 years ago and he reached out around the 5 year mark. I once reached out though, in a moment of guilt and stress, to an ex in attempt to apologize for everything that happened (at that time 4yrs in the past.). Was blocked instantly, 100% deserved.	0
What thing, serious or not, you don’t really like in your SO, but look past it because you love them?	*His unwillingness to see a doctor when he is sick.* Seriously, I don't get it and it's obviously bad for his health	His grandfather is a trump supporter and is VERY rascist, both my boyfriend and i are mexican and african. He also kills animals and has fur coats His father is a "hunter" and is very violent. On friday he grabbed my partners throat and threatened to kill him with me sitting there, ive never been more scared for my life But my actual partner is almost perfect, the only thing i dont like is his views on abortion (like he even deserves an opinion, he doesnt have a uterus;he wouldnt ever get one) and him eating meat.	1
Women of AskMen, has browsing this sub changed any of your views?	Yeah, I really liked being friends with men but I didn't realize just how much vitriol there was towards the female gender. Now I'm much more hesitant about these things.	Yes. Well maybe not changed views but it's nice to learn some things. Even if they are sad things, like how scared men are of being nice or chatty with an unknown child, even if it's at a playground, for fear of being seen as a predator. I'm sorry that happens.	0
Men that decided to be single, why?	I stayed single for a few years after getting divorced. Honestly it was nice to be able to do whatever I felt like doing. Friends going out? I'm there. Wings and beer for dinner? Hell yeah. Work til 7? Ain't nobody complaining but me. House a mess? Only if I'm the one who made it. Play video games all weekend? Sure. Eventually I started dating someone who fits in really well to the stuff I already like to do and decided to marry her.	So I am excluding all the fwb, short terms and casuals since while they were an absolute a blast they are not relevant. Just relationships pursed as long terms: First long term: Ended in loss of attraction and was heading into dead bedroom so I pulled the plug. Next one: Dating was amazing but she was OCD to a pretty extreme level and I absolutely could not handle living with someone like that so I called it. Next one: She was an extreme extrovert and heavy partier and I am pretty introverted, we were mismatched and struggling because of it by the end so she called it. Last one: Both of us work higher end professional careers, she got posted overseas and I didn't want to give up my career so we mutually called it. Otherwise I suspect we would have worked out indefinitely. Current one: Steady as she goes.	1

Those who need them, do you prefer to wear contacts or glasses? why?	I wear contacts for many of the reasons mentioned already but one weird perk is that my eyes don't water when I'm chopping onions with contacts in.	Glasses. I can't stand putting stuff in my eyes, and I've been paranoid about then not being able to get them \*out\* or getting infections.. The worst thing that can happen with my glasses is I smear something greasy on them or have to adjust if watching TV lying down (I keep an old pair as my emergecy spares as my eyesight is pretty bad)	1
What "normal thing" today (relating to women) will look shockingly regressive in 2050?	Lack of adequate parental leave in a lot of countries (...the US). The expectation that mothers should take a very small amount of unpaid time off then just get back to work. Also the fact that mothers are seen as the primary caregiver of children by default always, because of being female - that mothers get time off because they're expected to be the primary caregiver but fathers do not.	“Non verbal cues”. No one should be expected to read your mind when you don’t verbalize your thoughts. That’s complete insanity	1
Guys, what do you think of girls who gently tell you upfront that they like you, would that be considered too forward or do men actually prefer this method?	It's fine, absolutely no reason you can't be honest with him about your feelings. No one's going to be offended by something like that.	>Should I tell him that I like him or let it progress naturally? Meaning "sit passively like a good woman and do nothing unless he takes it on himself." Feel free to be a little more proactive than that.	1
Women in age gap relationships, how has your relationship progressed over the years?	It never worked out for me if we were in different life stages when it began. My husband is 7 years older than me, but we met when we were 28 and 35 and in the same life stages/meeting as equals which has worked out great for us.	I am 20 and my boyfriend is 30. Our relationship seems like a dream sometimes because of how great it is! He is so kind and loving, I love the shit out of him. We communicate really well which is hard to find it feels like and we both are happiest just snuggled up next to each other doing nothing. He tells me that he would've never guessed that I was so young because apparently I don't act it which is an important aspect I suppose.	1
Have you ever been forbidden or discouraged from doing something because "girls don't [fill in the blank]"?	*Women don't shoot themselves.* Only a woman who had so completely lost any sense of self, gone absolutely crazy, would just a gun to take her own life because *A woman wouldn't leave such a mess for someone to find.* She was suffering from life-shattering delusions, and her gender didn't change how she felt. **Suicide is suicide, no matter the gender of the person.**	When I was eight I really wanted to grow a beard. A big Santa beard! I told my mom about my aspirations, and she told me I couldn't since I was a girl. I was devastated, and thought she meant that I wasn't allowed to, not that I physically was unable. That's all I have. My mom and dad were pretty accepting and thought my brothers and I should learn things equally.	0
How would you deal with a girlfriend's intrusive male friend?	There's a good chance he's into your girlfriend. When I got engaged to my now-wife, one of her guy friends that very obviously harbored a long-time crush on her tried to convince her to postpone the wedding. In my case it was just kind of hilarious/sad, but in this case it seems to be fucking with your psyche a bit. Definitely worth a conversation with her, just keep your tone very non-accusatory and tell her how you feel.	I live my life by a simple rule, at least when it comes to things like this: If I've asked you to stop doing something three time and you keep doing it, I'm going to hit you hard enough that you stop doing it.	1
Stardew Valley players! What's your farm like? Who did you romance? What are you working on?	I made a orchard where I produce fuckton of fruit wines of various types. I also have a few animals of various types, including a void chicken!	OK, so I had never heard of Stardew Valley before this thread but looking through the comments, it sounded an awful lot like Harvest Moon which is one of my favorite games ever. I just looked it up and I think I'm in love again! Not that I need more convincing, but would anyone care to tell me what they like best about the game? If you've played Harvest Moon, what are some commonalities/differences? Also, can I only play it on the computer?	0
Have you ever met or dated someone that you thought was nearly perfect except for one (or a few things) that became a deal breaker?	Yup. She was pretty much everything I wanted... extremely attractive, seriously intelligent, funny as all get out, introspective... We dated for months and were really smitten with each other and the sex was great. We were having a discussion about gender issues one night when she revealed to me that she firmly believed in bullshit "patriarchy" theory and how easy men have it. After all of my life's struggles I just could not abide someone thinking that I had it easy because I'm white and have a cock.	Yep. She was hot, intelligent, had the same sense of humour and made it clear she was very attracted to me. The problem was that she was seeing about three other dudes at the same time, one of which was her ex, ending in her going radio silent. Welcome to online dating.	0
Speaking of Disney films, who do you think is the true villain in Beauty and the Beast?	I think Gaston gets a bad wrap. His only character flaw is that he's arrogant. That hardly makes you evil. Sure, he's old fashioned when it comes to gender roles but many women are as well. He's pretty much the only person in the town who likes Belle and even though he has bimbos throwing themselves at him, he like the girl with brains. When he hears that she was held captive by a monster he goes to get rid of it. He goes through dark scary woods and into a cursed castle to fight a monster who kidnaps innocent people. Put Gaston in green and it's basically Legend of Zelda.	The sorceress. Who changes an 11 year old, and _every member of their entire household_ to punish them because an 11 year old bratty prince didn't let her in when it was cold out. For that matter, if maybe he was really supposed to be older, why punish _his servants_ when this happened? No wonder he got resentful and LESS trusting of people over time, look at the crap that was done to him and everyone who worked for him.	0
Can friends "just" cuddle?	Well, if you were in a committed relationship would you feel OK with your partner "just" cuddling with someone else? Personally I wouldn't.	I ain't trying to cuddle, I'm trying to fuck. The fuck would I waste my time with that shit if I don't get to bust my nut at the end.	1
When was the last time you were legitimately scared of a man?	When I realized the guy with blown up ears and an 8 pack was my next opponent. My fear was well founded as he effortlessly took me down and mauled my half guard for 5 long minutes before the clock ran out.	I was raped a few weeks ago in my own home. Been pretty on edge about the guy coming back. Anyway, my brother came by to visit one morning and let himself in. He had texted me to say he was coming over but I slept through the texts. I woke up because he said something from the kitchen and I didn't recognize his voice. All I heard was a man in my house and I was scared shitless for a second until he said something else and I realized it was him.	0
What is a mistake you see dads make with their daughters that you think they overlook?	One thing my dad did was he would try to make good points but frame them like jokes. Like when I was a teen (and I thought I was super cool) I tried wearing a lot of black, and he'd say "you going to a funeral?" Or I'd wear something tight and he'd tell me to "stop stealing clothes from six year olds." When I wore too much makeup on my eyes he'd ask "who punched you?" When I was being an angsty teen that of course just made me mad, but now I realize he just didn't want me dressing like such a little punk.	Not everything has to be a life lesson. I literally got a lecture this weekend about keeping your head cool in a crisis because I had to borrow a torque screwdriver to repair my oven after it caught a greasefire from a leaky springform pan. Mind you, I dumped a bag of flour on it, put it out, and then set out to disassembling and cleaning once it cooled, but I still got a "It's important to remember where your head is at" for about two hours. I just wanted a screwdriver head that I didn't own.	0
How much are we really fooling you with our makeup/figure flattering clothes/push up bras etc?	Some people look way different without makeup. A little bit to enhance the facial features, eyelashes, eyes, etc is fine. But if you're a whole new person with makeup, that's false advertising. Push-up bras are straight up false advertising. No way around that one. Hiding a not flat stomach isn't false advertising, that's just showing off your better features while not necessarily showing your not-so-great features.	Most people tend to be more critical of their own imperfections than anyone else is, and as a result they try to hide them in the early part of a relationship. But if you get to the point that you feel enough of a connection to this person and you're willing to show them your imperfections, it's very likely that they're not going to mind them.	0
What makes a girl crazy or clingy?	Best advice I ever took (as a lady): If a guy doesn't seem interested, walk away. People who do not give you their time are not worth yours.	Do not call or text me (unless it's legitimately important): - In the middle of the night - When you know I'm at work - More than thrice daily - When you know I'm otherwise occupied Also, "crazy" or "clingy" is definitely achieved when you insist on contacting me after a break-up or have unreasonable illusions about every woman I speak with.	1
When did you realize you were dating an idiot?	This is finally a thread to which I have the perfect story. Keep in mind this girl was a relatively new driver, maybe a month in. I dated her in high school. She asked me while driving us somewhere how to roll down the windows in the car. About fourty five minutes later she said she needed to get gas and asked how to do it. I broke up with her that night. Edit: apparently it's normal to grow up around cars and not know how to operate the windows. Additionally it is totally normal that after thirty days or more into driving a car every day, a smart human still hasn't learned to work the gas tank or the BUTTON to roll a window down.	Not me, but the poor sod in the row in front of me at the cinema. After our showing of Inglorious Basterds, the girlfriend was getting out of her seat and said to her assumed boyfriend - “It’s amazing that that’s how Hitler actually died like” To which the boyfriend, sort of sadly, replied, - “Babe... we’ve talked about the TV thing” Leading me to believe that this is a running problem.	0
What's going on in your life that you feel like you can't talk to anyone about?	My ED is back. I feel like I'm in control of it but I know it's slowly taking over my life from the edges in. My mom is in denial about me having an ED, I don't want to put it on my best friend, and I don't want to tell my therapist because she'll make me talk about it and nag about stopping. This all started because I gained 30ish lbs after leaving an emotionally abusive relationship in August, which I'm still reeling from. Ugh.	I don't feel like I have much to live for at the moment. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I know that's how it'd come off if I told someone. I just don't think I'd care much if I found out I was dying or something.	0
Let's not be serious for a second here: If you were in an RPG, what class would you be and why?	Y'all need to roll the dice and roleplay whatever dimwitted combination of improbable you happen to get. *Stop worrying; there are no winners, there are no losers. This ain't a game dear, this is a role play game. Woman up and roll the dice* -Me, a couple of hours ago	Reading through this thread is great and fun and fine and all until I realize, "Shit...this is why I can't find any tanks."	0
That eternally single friend of yours - what's keeping you from setting them up?	He is a fairly abusive person. He can't see it in himself and doesn't want to go to therapy to resolve his problems. He's unhappy being single which only multiplies his underlying issues while ensuring no woman would come within a hundred feet of him romantically.	Playing match maker is a huge cultural taboo here. If someone wants to find love they have to do it alone and on their own.	1
Dual-income no kids: what’s life like for you?	We both have good careers. Our only debt is her car however we're renting the house. We can stay out late or make last minute plans whenever we want. We take a short vacation every 2 or 3 months. It does feel kind of odd now that most of our peers have children. Sometimes I forget that my friends can't always close out the bar anymore.	Single-income two kids isn't all that bad either. Life is good when you live within your means, no matter what your situation.	1
Have you witnessed or been a part of a random act of kindness or pay it forward type of situation and what was the experience?	I was at a Bernie Sanders rally a few months ago. It was super crowded and the media/tripods/cameras were obstructing a lot of views, but I could still see him. I heard an older couple next to me complaining they couldn't see him, so I offered to switch places with them so they could get a look. Reluctantly, they agreed. After about 10 minutes, they switched places with another person who couldn't see, who switched places with another person. It was pretty cool. edit: spelling	A guys credit card was refused when he was trying to pay for his car tags. He came up $0.75 short on cash. I gave him a dollar. Can't tell you how many times I've given gasoline to strangers to get the to town after they run out in front of my house. I always refuse to take money, telling them to pay it forward.	1
What do you wish you knew before living on-campus in college?	If you live in a co-ed dorm, you have to be just as worried about getting groped, flashed, etc as you do on the street. Carry something that can be used as a weapon as real weapons, including pepper spray, aren't allowed. Flashlights, umbrellas, and textbooks can work in a pinch.	This sounds bad, but if you share a room, do not be overly accommodating when working out your roommate agreement. If you know you'll feel uncomfortable with others sleeping in the room, let it be known. Anything like that, don't try too hard to be cool. Also, talk about problems as soon as they arise, rather than waiting until it's a huge issue. If you like peace, considering living in the quiet dorm. Of course, you can always go out to parties, but quiet dorms tend to be chill and focused on studies. Going to college is a huge adjustment. Living away from home is a huge adjustment. Many people struggle. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, whether it's your family, on campus services, or friends.	0
Who do you have a crush on at the moment?	A quiet guy I went to university with. He texts me randomly and we’ve met up (very) few times. He’s made it clear that he wants to get to know me but I’m not sure if it’s because he wants to be just friends. I might relocate for a new job so that would definitely stop our minimal relationship from growing. The struggles of being a shy person liking a shy person.	I have a crush on my SO, but also on other people: A coworker at my last job tops the list, and I’m 100% certain it’s a mutual crush. We’re friends though, and though the mutual attraction is unspoken, we know where we stand. Our friendship goes through cycles of being hot and cold, so it’s for the best that I don’t see him on a daily basis anymore. Right now I have a fascination with my new coworker. It’s not a full out crush in the old school sense of blushing and butterflies, but he’s the one I’m always seeking out first and spending afternoon coffee breaks with. When the shininess wears off, I’m pretty sure this is a friendship crush.	1
Ladies in interracial relationships, have you gotten any backlash from family/society in general?	I'm a white woman married to an Arab man. Don't even get me started. "Does he make you cover up/cook/stay at home? Does his family accept you? So are you... muslim...? Are you allowed to do X?" My husband is an atheist. If my dad had still been alive he would have given me no end of shit for it. He was mega racist. Thankfully since he's dead that is not an issue and all my other family don't see it as an issue to bring up in the first place.	White guy here, but married to an Asian woman. Been together 20 years and I can honestly say it has never even been mentioned, much less been an issue.	1
Why is dating so complicated in America?	In Norway we tend to have sex first and then try and find out if maybe we want to spend time in the vicinity of eachother in a normal setting.	From an American perspective, I find it weird that Europeans tend to be "together" after a week of knowing each other. I prefer the American way of going to dinner a couple of times before you decide if you want to be exclusive.	1
Is lusting for other women (wanting to bone them) while you’re in a loving monogamous relationship ok, or normal and why?	Matthew 5:28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Do you want her to do you like that? Luke 6:31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.	Looking and finding other people attractive is normal. But after that, it gets very grey. Imagine the roles are reversed and you are witnessing your wife lusting after her male coworker, checking him out, imagining what sex with him is like, getting the adrenaline rush from flirtations, etc. It would probably bum you out to realize that a lot of her time was spent daydreaming about other dudes’ dicks. Just make sure you aren’t allocating a huge chunk of your time to fantasizing about other people and that you are still finding ways to engage with your actual partner.	0
What's the littlest thing someone has said that's upset you, because it showed how little they actually know you?	When someone says X pair of shoes are too expensive. O-o Maybe for you but nor for me. Plus, I have soft-sensitive feet and invest in quality & comfortable footwear. I don't wear cheap shoes that will f'ck up my feet. Prefer to invest in high quality shoes than have dozens of low quality shoes that are crap. I know countless women in their 20's & 30's who have f'cked up feet for wearing cheap low quality shoes, with bunions, hammer toes, sores, etc., They have to have surgery while I have feet that are presentable and good to go! :))	"Where can you get the best crab cakes in town?" "Mom, I don't know. I'm allergic to shellfish." Every. Visit.	0
What notion about yourself would you like to dispell?	Let’s dispel once and for all with this fiction that I don’t know what I'm doing. I know exactly what I'm doing.	I'm not sexist because I act in a manner to which women respond well; and am subsequently successful with them. I didn't make the rules.	1
What can an ugly woman do to be seen as worthy of love?	"I do try to be upbeat and cheerful but the loneliness eats away at me" OP, hang in there. You're doing all the right things like putting yourself out there. Opportunity will come at random points in your life; the more you meet new people the more chances you get of meeting that special someone who wants to share the rest of their life with you.	Be willing to be with a man who's just as ugly. If you don't like that option then you either need to absolutely luck the fuck out or get less ugly yourself.	1
How do you feel about tending to your parents when they become old and need care?	I won't do it. I wouldn't want my kids to care for me, either. That's would be selfish and entitled of me to assume it of them. I can't anyway. I'd rather pay someone to do it.	Honestly, I worry about it a lot. I'm an only child, I'm barely scraping by financially, my parents have no money, and they don't care for their health as well as they could. I'll absolutely help care for them in whatever capacity they need but I'm worried I won't be able to.	0
In your opinion, when does a boy become a man?	When he is swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon, with all the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon.	When he stops asking childish questions like, "when does a boy become a man?". If you have to ask, you're not one.	1
My parents dropped the bomb yesterday.. they're separating. Men of AskMen who have been in this situation, how have you coped and helped you family cope?	Idolizing your parents marriage is easy, but keep in mind, they wouldn't be separating if they were happy. Just treat your dad the same as you would always have, and if you notice him struggling emotionally, lend a hand.	I was the same age as you. Realise that this is **their** shit to work through, that there is nothing you can do about it, that they are still your parents and they still love you and you can still love them, that you are still a family even though you might not be together, and try to not let them force you into siding with one or the other. You're an adult, they're adults. They can confide in you, but don't let their opinion of each other affect your opinion of them. Basically, treat it like the break-up of two very close friends, neither of whom you can side with over the other, and let them handle it. If they try to be childish with each other, remind them to be fucking adults and deal with it as such rather than drag you in.	0
What day do you consider to be the worst in your entire life?	The day I snooped through my ex wife's phone and found out that she was cheating on me with her crossfit friend. Then confronting her about it and her telling me that she loves him.	An amalgamation of multiple days in Alaska. My memory of my time there is a bit screwy so I don't necessarily know what bad shit happened on different days.	1
Lads, which of your jokes are you still riding the high from years later?	Sort of the opposite, someone made a joke to me so good that it stabbed my very soul. Someone once told me that I could make love to a cheerio and not break it. Still hurts.	In high school, I had an art class where I sat at a table with this girl named Alexis. It was only us two at the table, so we had the whole class period to flirt with each other. She asked if I had a girlfriend. I answered "no". She said "Oh, so do you just have hoes?" I responded, "Something like that." "What's one of your hoes' names?" "Alexis." EDIT: Nothing spectacular happened. She just smiled and we talked about something else.	1
Ladies, what are the things that your SO does that you think is cute but others would find weird?	He laughs in his sleep. He's really easy to sleep next to, doesn't snore, doesn't fidget. But he has this creepy, maniacal chuckle that only comes out while he's sleeping.	He sings and claps and makes weird noises all the time. He'll just start making up a song about something and doing a weird dance with little to no provocation. He does this usually at least once in the morning when I'm getting ready for work.	1
What's the weirdest thing a girl has done thinking it was sexy?	When ever my wife drinks more than a couple beers she starts to tell anyone who will listen about the size of my cock. She goes on and on. This has happened with neighbors, family members , her friends. When I ask her to please stop she just says "if you have it flaunt it". She seems to really enjoy it because she gets really wild in bed afterwards. However it makes me really uncomfertable. Yes, I have asked her to stop many times and she always says she will and she apologizes. Then it just happens again.	Buddies GF claimed she put all the veggies he had in the fridge in her vagina. So he could taste her when she wasn't around. That was just the tip of her crazy as we found out later.	0
Why do you think that "there are no girls on the internet" is a thing?	Due to the subject matter, this thread will be watched closely. Read the rules before posting, and don't be an ass. Edit: Alright. Too many people don't know how to read the rules. Enough has been said and we're just seeing variations on the same rule-breaking themes. This post has been locked.

Has your boss ever told you to wear makeup?	Nope and I very rarely wear any to work (only if for a big meeting/interview where I'm dressed up in a suit instead of my usual business casual.) If anyone ever told me to wear makeup, I would be very upset. Unless wearing makeup becomes the norm for both genders and is thus expected of everyone at my place of work, it is unfair to focus on women as needing to take the extra time out of their day to put on makeup to conform to a societal sense of beauty.	I don't know. Work performance isn't the only thing that matters in a professional environment. Dressing and looking professional are also a part of the job. A bare face isn't necessarily unprofessional, but if you put two women next to each other dressed the exact same way, the one wearing makeup would look more professional.	1
Would you want to know if your SO made a one night mistake and made out with someone else on a night out? Why or why not?	I'd want to know, purely because secrets usually come out eventually and it's better finding out now than in 2 years time	Lol you got dumped because you whored it up one night, didn't you? My answer: You better take it to your grave because I'm leaving you if you tell me.	1
Women who love themselves and have high confidence, how do you do it ?	I used to hate myself and have very low self-esteem, but I have just realized that... well I am conventionally attractive, I am smart, I am successful for my age and on track to be more so, I am loved by the people who matter to me... How could I not feel good about myself when I realize there is nothing to feel bad about? Sure I still have my small hang-ups like wanting a flatter belly or whatever, but I know that it doesn't affect my ability to love and be loved...so eh?	I like to think of myself as my best friend. I'm the only one who will always be there for me. I would never say a negative thing to my friend and therefore won't say a negative thing to myself. Sometimes you have your down days, but as a few others have said, you actively say "no" to those comments.	0
What scene from your life, whether wonderful and beautiful or utterly painful, do you often replay in your head?	My fiance coming inside from having a smoke. She stated she was dizzy and the fell to the ground seizing. She went brain dead and died a week later. The experience wakes me up most nights.	This was a fairly recent moment, about a little more than two weeks ago. I had just met up with a girl I met back in August. After having In and Out and a lengthy conversation, with an intense make out session, I drove her back to the place she was staying at. While I was driving and she was in the back seat stroking my hair and holding my hand, the song from The Weeknd and Daft Punk 'I Feel it Comin' was playing. The MJ vibe and the lyrics to the song spoke to us, and to the intimate moment we had. Just gotta wait at least a few more weeks to see where things go for us.	1
What do you think about women who are taller than you?	I've got no problem with a woman being taller. But in *almost all* circumstances a women will prefer a taller man. When you go online what is the NUMBER ONE thing a girl asks for on her dating profile... a *taller* man. Not a man with hair, not a man that doesn't smoke, not an intelligent man. A *taller* man. So this question is completely academic. Better go ask the girls "what do you think about men that are shorter than you".	Not even a negative for me, but often a dealbreaker for them. My girlfriend is four inches taller than I, and I was half-expecting it to be an issue for her. After a while, I just bought in that she wasn't bothered and didn't secretly prefer a taller man and that's that. It's fun. I'm a leg and ass man anyway.	0
What complaint about men are you absolutely sick of hearing?	I have a bunch but I guess I'll stick to this one, since it directly pertains to me: The idea that older men who seek out younger women (18+ obviously) are gross. As long as everyone is consenting, those people can fuck off and mind their own business.	That men aren't empathetic. What a bleak outlook on half of humanity to say that they don't have something that is universal to human expirience.	0
What's your view on your SO having an opposite gender best friend?	Depends about that guy. There is so many factors that its hard to judge. If he would be better looking than me, smarter, richer etc, then Houston we have a problem. I am not really tolerant person.	I have a question in addition to this one - does it matter how long they have been best friends? I have a male best friend but we've been friends since 7 years old, so it's not like he became my friend in order to get me into bed.	0
How long would you date a girl before asking her to be your girlfriend?	What I want to figure out. Is why you call it dating if you aren't bf and gf? Because at that point that's not dating. That's called being friends.	Depends where you are I'm guessing. I'm here in Ireland, and after the first date, if it goes well, you'll find yourself just spending days with them and then you realize you're totally in a relationship. Of course I may be speaking from minority, I truly don't know, but from what I've seen, the whole multiple dates to judge a person thing, seems to be a US setup.	0
Men of reddi, how did getting in shape change your life?	Pros: I look better, I'm happier with myself, people are nicer to me (not just girls) and I just feel better in general. Con: I can't eat as many brownies as I would like	You're in dangerous waters bro, some extremely healthy and active 500pound person is gonna flip out that you don't have to get in shape to change your life.	1
What is the most offensive thing you've ever said?	The one I feel the worst about was probably because it wasn't intended unlike most of the offensive comments I make. I was in the middle of a high school class, and one of the dorkier girls (you know the ones big coke bottle glasses, always reminding the teacher about homework, but not actually that smart) was wearing a t-shirt supporting ice hockey. Trying to be nice since everyone else gave her a hard time, I tapped her on the shoulder and said "do you play or just watch?" I realized I fucked up when I saw the look on her face and my buddies started laughing. She storms off in a huff and I dumbfoundedly try to figure out where I fucked up when I see it was a shirt supporting special olympics hockey. 15 years later I still feel bad about it.	I would call your remark "black humor" or "gallows humor". The disturbing thing is quite a number of people in Asia actually believe this about animals, and do in fact torture them before consuming them.	1
How intensely do you feel emotions? Am I "insensitive"?	Not sure how "normal" it is, but I'm the exact same way. My parents will ask me how I feel when X is happening, or if I'm excited for X in the near future. I always tell them that I don't experience excitement the same way they do. Aunt dies, sister goes to a new country, meet my half-sister for the first time in my life. All are important events, and I recognize them as such, but they just don't register much of an emotional response from me.	I think emotions are pretty important so you're missing out on something if you don't have them. Because men are discouraged from showing emotion I'm always a bit skeptical when a fellow dude says they can't feel emotion. Maybe they can but they've learned to turn it way down/ off, I think. Edit-- why am I down voted?	1
In what non-abusive ways did your parents cause long term damage?	My dad cheated on my mom.. but instead of trying to work on the marriage and moving forward since he did stay for the family.. my mom beat it in to me to this day all men cheat all men are bad.. .i found out later she never had sex with my dad .. ever! No wonder he cheated... and stayed for 36 years! Now I trust knowone.. and can not get truly close to anyone.	They didn't say "I love you" much to me or my older sister, or even between themselves. A few years ago they made an effort to say it more and the first time it happened I sincerely thought one of them was deathly ill since it was so unusual. They also weren't big on physical affection or praise in general. It can be very hard for me to acknowledge when others do positive things, but I can focus with laser precision on negative things. They aren't great at standing up for me or my sister either. One side of our family is just a bunch of old fashioned, spoiled assholes and it was always "you should be the bigger person" even when I was a literal child. Edit: I'm so bummed that so many people relate to this. Group hug, y'all 🤗	0
Guys who waited until mariage to start having sex because of their girlfriend, how long did you wait and was it worth it?	Something I'd add is if you're jerking off a ton and watching porn, are you really waiting? At that point you'd be doing more harm than good in my opinion. Harm to your brain chemistry. A mans desire for a woman should be almost unbearable. Don't jerk off for a while and see what I mean.	As long as you're with someone who's going to be emotionally available, positive, and empathetic, you'll discover pretty quickly that losing your virginity is just not a big deal. It's silly to have sex just to be able to say you did, but if you're with someone you really care about and trust, it's silly to wait if you want to do it. Use a fuckin condom.	0
I've noticed women act differently when I tell them my real name. What are your thoughts on men with feminine names?	My partner and I both have unisex names that are frequently mistaken for belonging to the opposite gender. Confusion abounds, and it is beautiful.	If you were Korean or something, I wouldn't even think twice about it. But I can't say I've ever heard that name used for men in other nationalities besides Asian. Otherwise, it might strike me as odd for a split second and then I would proceed to give no craps. I've known dudes named "Shannon" and I find that a lot more feminine than Kim.	1
Women of Reddit, have you experienced more slut-shaming or virgin/prude-shaming? How has each affected you differently?	Probably prude shaming, I wasn't a virgin when I started real "adult" dating but I also wasn't interested in hookups or casual sex, nor was I interested in celibacy before marriage or someone deeply religious. I caught a lot of shit from guys who didn't understand that there's a middle ground. They usually decided to make fun of me for it, usually while we were making out. Because THAT'S what's gonna make me wanna have sex. Very little slut shaming sticks out in my mind other than an incident where an Evangelical woman told me I was probably going to get raped for wearing a tight t shirt.	I'm a prude, I've only had one sexual partner. Even so everyone takes the time to call me a slut or whore, especially my mom. This has made me believe I am a slut but over the years I've learned that it's not true. If I'd had been prude shamed I don't think I would have felt as bad about it because I'd see my body as still clean and pure. I wouldn't be able to take anyone seriously and I wouldn't want to deal with anyone who dislikes the fact that I take care of my body.	1
I see it all the time on r/askmen but are there girls out there who have been completely oblivious to signs of interests from guys?	Definitely. But when I look back on it now, I think it's often been with Nice Guys™. You know, the ones who do their best to ingratiate themselves to you *just as friends*, and eventually get pissed off with you when you don't fall into their arms once you've magically realised that they've been *there for you all this time* while other guys are just assholes. The problem is that they intentionally presented themselves as 'just a friend' to me. The point when I realised they were interested was usually when they eventually got pissed off that I wasn't dating them yet.	It's not so much that I'm oblivious, but I don't trust that men are actually interested in me unless they both directly say they are AND act in a way that makes their interest obvious. I have a little bit of an ugly duckling complex, and even though I think that objectively I'm not bad-looking and I'm a fun person to be around, I'm pretty insecure about guys putting me in either the just friends or just sex buddies category because I'm not pretty enough or interesting enough to hold their interest long-term. Which means that unless a man outright says "I want to date you" and then plans a date, I assume he's just interested in friendship or casual sex.	0
Have you ever wanted to take a break from life? Like take a break from it all and do nothing? Like go live with a friend that no one knows about and just be a bum for a year or 2?	My dream is to have a hippie summer, packing myself, my fiance, and some friends into a bus and riding across the country, doing drugs and doing gigs/bartering for money, food, and goods.	I will do that this year. Have been planning it for a while. In a few months I will move to a village on a tropical island and do nothing for eight to ten months.	0
What does your girlfriend do to initiate sex?	Kiss on him, grab his cock, and tell him how badly you want it inside you. Not that hard tbh	She began to fellate me at 5am and said she wanted some. I couldn't at the time cuz I was way too tired so she went out on the patio for a dip in the tub instead.	1
Ladies of Reddit who’ve cut off your (ex) best friend, what happened and how long did it take you to get over it?	She slept with my ex boyfriend when I wasn't over him and I cut both out of my life. I can say hi now and hold a small talk conversation when running into either one.	Wasn't my best friend but she was definitely very close to me. It took about 8 hours of her holding me hostage in her house, saying that I had been drugging her water, food, tapping her phone, that I was a clone and she was going to abduct my son and find the real me, for me to cut her off. It took me about a week to get over it, and now I don't miss her at all. The week that it took me to get over her was more fear of her coming and breaking into my house in the middle of the night.	0
What's your most awkward accidental penis touch story?	A girl in my gym class was going for the ball in volleyball as I was going for it. She slammed my dick hard enough I almost blacked out. Felt worse than when I got stabbed ( which was also an accident).	Gay thread where OP tries to humble brag about a huge Johnson that everyone just can’t help but grab. First story did not happen, second is embellished at best	1
My father cheated on my mother with a much younger woman so how do I explain to my brothers?	> Heck, can't understand why my father would do such a thing... Key issue right there. Yet, you plan to explain it to your brothers. Sounds like you're not the right person to do this.	I do hope your entire family completely cuts off all contact with him. Cheaters do not deserve the affection produced by their children. I do hope you and your brothers begin to resent him. His everlasting punishment for his deeds will be never being allowed to talk to his own children. I can't think of a worse pain than to be excommunicated by your own kid.	1
My girlfriend just said "I'm obsessed with your face" what are some of the weirdest compliments you've received?	"I really like the way your hair is dark in the middle" My 8 year old nephew reminding me that I needed to do my roots.	That i have nice calves. I have no tattoos and thats where i wanted to put my first tattoo partially because of the compliment. But she doesn't want me to get one there. Women are baffling.	1
Why do so many men hate high waisted jeans on women?	It takes a very specific body type to look good in them, and that body type would look so much better in almost anything else.	*a wild feminist appears* What if I told you not everything women do has to be met with men's approval? I like high waisted styles and I'ma keep doing me. Edit: Waiting for all the downvotes, but I regret nothing.	1
Do any men actually find heels attractive?	I think heels make women walk funny, and in general are not sexy. Exception: Heels, long long legs with really short skirt, patterned mesh stockings or really long sox. And a simple sleeveless loose top, revealing the midriff. No bra. dancing equals sexy	Yes, I think they can make a girl look more attractive. But it's not very attractive if you can barely walk when you're wearing them.	0
What things have you been asked for from a partner/FWB that were hard no's? How did they react?	Wanted me to sell my eggs, solely for our financial gain. He didn't have a job, was in college paid for by his rich dad. His dad was smart enough to have him on a comfortable but meager allowance for essentials. I worked parttime as a grocery store cashier, still in high school. We were pretty young (me 18, him nearly 21), but I was still deeply offended that he'd ask this of me before even trying to get a job. He was disappointed. Tried to coax me into it for a while. Needless to say.. we're not together anymore. I upgraded my self esteem and standards for s.o's accordingly.	The very concept of FWB is a hard no for me. Waste my time because I'm not *quite* hot enough for you to be with only me and you want to see if someone better comes along? GTFO with that noise, I'd rather just be single in that case than risking my safety, dignity and self esteem to be someone's walking fleshlight. I've been told FWB doesn't really mean that (so maybe I'm off base here), and maybe it's because I've been in a relationship for a long time, but to me, it's stringing someone along and it's basically telling someone "You're hot enough for me to get hard to, but not hot enough for me to actually want to date, so I'm going to waste away your fertile years while I try and find my Giselle." No freaking way.	1
How much attention should you expect from your girlfriend in a group setting?	I hate this too OP. There's a quote from downtown abbey I'll botch but it goes like "I know I'm not the most impressive man but I want to marry a women who thinks I am." Be with someone who is crazy about you. Not someone who is willing to be with you but lukewarm when it gets down to it.	Talk to her. I personally am ok with her giving me the least attention because I get a ton of attention from her anyways and it's nice to know she has friends besides me.	0
What is it about your current SO that makes them so different than others you’ve been involved with?	We share the same height even though I am not short, she is much more socially extrovert and outgoing than me (has 700 facebook friends while I have 70) and mildly socially dominates me (without arrangement or consent, ordering me not to watch porn sometimes or we won't have sex). I wouldn't say she is a mother figure to me but more like I am very very young so my rich parents paid professional female tutor for me to help me through life.	My past girlfriends, no offense to them, have been kinda dumb. It was always frustrating as hell when they would get mad at me over some little thing and there was no rationalizing with them. My current SO on the other hand is really intelligent. It's amazing what she can come up with. She always has insightful opinions on things. We get along great because we can both voice our thoughts well. It feels like more of a partnership than some sort of competition. She's pretty great.	0
Women who have taken a guy's virginity, Could you tell and did they tell you?	I took my husband's virginity. He told me before hand. He had some issues at first getting too nervous to perform, but we worked through his issues together. The only reason I could tell was that he had some issues staying hard in the beginning, but, once we got going, I couldn't tell he was a virgin at all! Gentlemen out there, don't be afraid to be honest with a girl about your virginity. If she is bothered by you being a virgin, then she isn't worth giving your V-card to.	My boyfriend and I took each other's virginities and we both knew the other was a virgin. It was cute because he was very nervous and had a hard time getting it up and it just made it worse when I screamed in pain when he tried to get in (I told him to go slow! xD). Then when he did get in he kinda humped but didn't really know to go in and out, and then he lost it again within a couple minutes. We had the courage to try again later that day and it was a lot better. It may not have been the best first time but I thought it was really adorable that he had no idea what to do and it was really special because I got to share it with the person I am going to spend my life with.	1

Ladies of color, what's been harder to deal with throughout your life: racism or sexism?	Both equally, but I actually found that when I was heavier THAT was actually way worse, if that makes a difference at all. I've had my fair share of anti-Hispanic racism and sexism for being a woman, but nothing ever really compared to what I got for being overweight when I was overweight.	Sexism because I'm female in a male dominated career I suppose and I don't look tough even though I am. I'm white though so I suppose that's why I haven't ever really experienced racism and as I am an atheist being 'technically jewish' never really comes up, and when it does there has been some insults. However neither has ever gotten to me, racism and sexism is a part of life for me and I just laugh it off (or punch the person and then laugh it off) Why take it seriously?	1
Anyone got a breast lift? Was it worth it?	If you want breast lift *with* implants, I take it as your breasts are not too large. If you have average-sized or slightly big breasts and they're on the saggy side, you can actually lift them up with some exercises. While I haven't seen an example myself, a personal trainer had said you can ever make your breasts appear one cup size bigger by gaining some muscles on the chest area.	I personally do not, but have a close friend who has. Her situation was similar to your own. Young, no kids, yet already deflated breasts. She got a lift with implants and absolutely loved them. No sensation loss in nipples. She said she would definitely do it again. Best of luck!	0
How long were your SO and you together before you stole their favorite hoodie?	My husband hates hoodies, so I've never seen him wear one. I'd be creeped out if he did. Of the guys I've dated who wear hoodies, I've never borrowed or stolen one. I can handle being around guys, but hoodies seem to soak up the smell of their deodorant or body spray and saturate to smell of choking me if I try to wear it. I'm really sensitive to smells and can't handle strong ones for long periods of time, so hoodies are safe from me.	I offered my SO a sacrificial hoodie on our second date, so she wouldn't steal my actual favorite hoodie. So far, my countermeasures have worked	0
What are your lesser-known tips for improving your appearance?	Say you have to be out the door at 7. AM, PM, doesn't matter. I can get dressed in 10 minutes if I'm being slow. However, if I get dressed at 6:50, I usually end up making mistakes, not looking over myself more carefully. Get ready at least 30 minutes before going out.	Keeping your body fat % relatively low. Studies show that women are most attracted to men around 10% body fat, as it signals a strong immune system.	1
What up with guys loving their head and beard being scratched?	depends my head is covered in tumours so when a girl tries to scratch my head she usually comes away with bloody fingers. but generally its considered pleasent.	basically, every man is touch-starved from a very early age. it's a cultural problem and its known to be a contributing factor to a lot of health problems. ladies, touch your man more, he needs it.	0
How would you feel about a woman wanting to masturbate before sex?	Sounds like a reasonable request. Throw it at the bedroom wall, and see if it sticks. If it was me, I'd enjoy watching her get herself off. Alternatively, take the time to teach him how to get you off via masturbation. When the woman cums first, it takes a lot of performance pressure off the guy to not cum too early. A lot more time enjoying the sensations and alot less time thinking of baseball stats.	I don’t think that I would want to sleep with someone who couldn’t orgasm with their partner(s). I’d probably pass.	1
What's something women do that's essentially shooting themselves in the foot when trying to meet guys?	Not show signs of interest. A conversation can be just that; a platonic conversation. To actually show interest and make the guy know you are into him is another point.	Being overly interested in me. Sorry, there was someone else at the table too. At least try to act like we were there as three people not 2 + 1. Did I even look like I was interested? You're nice enough, but no.	1
What's something non-sexual you only do in private?	Say random things, like nonsensical statements. Singing completely off key, that too usually not real songs just shit from my mind. Crying but not sobbing like a bitch or the emotional tears in the eyes but this weird half sob that I do to just get a feeling out of my system. Stank face and fist pump when something good happens.	Sometimes when I am really really down, I watch that 3 minute end of the one Simpsons episode where Homer went back to his hated job as Marge qas pregnant with Maggie, and he was punished with the demotivational plaque (Don't forget, you're here forever) and he later used Maggies pictures to cover it in a way that it reads Do it for her. And cry for 10 minutes. Then the world is a better place.	0
I've noticed that a lot of women women prefer reading/imagining their porn over watching it. Why do you think this is? And why do you think there such a strong preference among men towards visual porn?	I think women get more into how a guy makes them feel and men are more about how the chick looks.	A lot of visual porn is not made for women, the majority of it actually is not made for women. It's made with the goal of getting guys off and often isn't appealing because it comes across as fake, or the actors are unattractive, or the close ups are showing body parts that I'm not aroused by.	0
Female protagonists in video games: Are there any games out there that you think do an fantastic job portraying a girl/woman in the drivers seat of a story?	Sorry, the way you phrased this question made me feel like I should be answering "Oh hi. This is Lara Croft. And personally, I think that the only problem with video games is how many ancient works of architectural beauty are left unexploded and unplundered."	Maybe this is a cheat since it's an RPG, but I think the Dragon Age games are AWESOME to play as a female character. The romance options/storylines (gay and straight) are MUCH better when you play as a woman. Same goes for the Mass Effect series. Plus the FemShep voice acting is way better than the male voice acting IMO. Life is Strange and Horizon Zero Dawn are also great.	0
How much is normal to ask about your girlfriends ex?	I think asking a SO how long they dated an ex and why they broke up is valid. Other than that, it can get into insecurity territory and do more harm than good.	is this normal behaviour? Hey you know what I don't like? When women force me to conform to an arbitrary standard of normalacy in their heads hey is it normal behaviour to not watch tv? To prefer talking on the phone to texting? To ask lots of questions about the universe? Guess what there is no normal fuck your normal to answer your question, why wouldnt the guy want to know about someone else you dated? that way he can avoid his pitfalls and play to his strengths tldr: you are dumb	1
In your current/previous relationships, what have you taken for granted?	With my first boyfriend I took how fun he was for granted, he was a blast and always wanted to do stuff. After a few slug-people I found another fun one to date though.	I had a partner for 6 years who never lied to me. He wouldn't even give in to subtle white lies. Honesty in the purest form was incredibly important to him. And since I've had relationships with other human beings who lie, even though it's mostly small insignificant lies, I've realized just how much I took for granted that kind of security and ability to trust spoken words. My most recent ex, as terrible as he was for me, was very receptive to relationship tactics I learned in therapy. Things like sitting him down just to tell him how he's made me feel good lately or specific things he does that make me happy or frustrate me, etc. My current partner is just not into that at all, and I really took for granted having someone who willingly embraced that robotic approach to emotions.	0
What kind of date would you prefer to be taken out on if a girl asked you out?	"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach" Just talking over dinner sounds like a great first date	Take me to the zoo or aquarium. I am totally a geek when it comes to animals. It's a lot of walking and talking, so we get to know each other. And if the conversation putters out, welp, we're at the zoo and penguins are hilarious.	0
What is something you'd like to say to a friend/ coworker/ relative/ partner, but can't for whatever reason? What is the reason you cannot?	Forget your boyfriend, he doesn't love you like I do and come back home because you're the only one that puts up with me and I miss you. I can't say that because she's my best friend and she's happy where she is. I don't exactly want to spoil things for her.	Honestly, sometimes I just want to gush to my friends about how much I love them and think they're amazing people who deserve all the best in life and I want them to be so happy. But I get self-conscious and I think that could easily be awkward for everyone so I keep it to myself.	0
Women who have decided not to have a dog, what made you decide that?	I like that this this post quoted > [Women who have decided not to have children, what made you decide that?](https://redd.it/4n4n0h) Some people have dogs as an alternative to having kids.	- I don't want the additional expenses that come with dog ownership - I don't want to pick up poop - I don't want to go for a walk everyday	0
How many things from porn have you tried in real life? Did you crash and burn or was it better than expected?	Bounced my dick on an ex's cheek once cause I saw it in porn. She just kind of looked at me and I just looked at her and said "I don't know what I thought that was gonna do." I guess it worked out because we had a good laugh about it. Another ex wanted to see what all the hype about oily tits was about so we tried it out. It looked ridiculous, but they felt amazing. She rubbed them on my dick and we found out that was a move for when she was ready for me to finish. That one came from watching porn and I would say it was a success.	Porn is real life too, those are real people really fucking. I don't really see a distinction between porn and real life. I think I've tried pretty much everything that looked hot to me in porn, with some exceptions that I'm just not strong enough to do (fucking someone while also carrying them, lifting them up with one hand, etc) With some partners it went more or less the same as it was in the porn, with other partners not. Everyone has different limitations, people with fewer physical and psychological limitations can pretty much do it exactly like it is in porn if they so choose.	1
[Feedback!] People who've asked AskMen for advice: How did we do? How did it go?	Ugh, it was awful. I wanted advice on how to bring up the subject of a late period with someone I wasn't serious with, and all the comments were "teeheehee, your problem now cunt" edit: You'll see some people questioning me and downvoting in the children of this comment. That's what I mean by "the sentiment".	I was finally coaxed into trying boxer briefs. Solved all my issues with running and other workouts. Thanks guys! Edti: Oh, and also I got a tip about sterilizing my razor with alcohol before I shave. It has reduced my bumps noticeably.	0
How do you deal with body insecurities e.g. belly fat when getting intimate with your SO?	If they didn't like what they saw, they wouldn't be interested in getting intimate. Plain and simple. If you feel like you're not sure, you can communicate to them "hey, I'm kinda insecure about x part of me." Chances are they'll have words of comfort. Believe them! Remember they have free will and they choose to get intimate with you as much as you choose to with them. Think about it from their POV. You're probably not analyzing their body during this time, so why would they be scrutinizing yours during this time? You're in a heated moment and chances are they're not looking/paying attention to that and/or they just consider it part of the whole sexy you.	Obligatory not a woman. So, as a lurker, here's my two cents. Relationships are about communicating. If there's something about you that you're insecure about, and you're with someone you love, poor at least want to build a relationship with.. You need to communicate these things. If your SO cares about you, then they'll help reassure you that your internal holdups are your own, and they don't share your view. It'll not only help bring you closer, or weed out the unworthy, but also help you heal from your insecurities. Though, this isn't first date material, so YMMV 🤷‍♂️	1
Do any guys find it hard to cum from a blowjob?	First off, if they act like it's a chore or if they are doing me a favor then there's no way I'm coming. Also, a problem for me is that I last a good 10+ minutes and most women are too lazy to give head that long. If they have skills I can come faster, but they usually aren't very good at it. I will offer instruction if she's open to it, but some women are just better at this than others.	I do but only because there's not enough pressure from her mouth when she's not using her hand, once she gets the hand action in there then I'm good to go. I don't get a lot of them so my biggest problem aside from that is getting out of my own head.	0
Ladies, how many of you struggle to "get off" also, any tips???	Wear a pair of fitted panties, preferably cotton. Then rub your clit through them after drinking a glass of water. You'll feel the sensitive area where your clit is. Then rub it in up and down or whatever direction you want. Do it a bit fast but don't put a lot of pressure, just use medium pressure. See if it works for you. It did for me	It is fairly rare that I orgasm during partnered sex. It was years before I could cum at all, honestly, years in which I found masturbation boring. I was sexually active, I enjoyed sex, but orgasm wasn't something I'd experienced. Somewhere in my mid 30, that changed for whatever reason. I don't know if it was a shift in hormones or a growing comfort with sexual fantasy or something else, but orgasm became possible, if still not easy.	0
Women who have been cheated on in previous relationships, how do you keep the anxiety of it happening in your new relationships away?	That if someone is shitty enough and they want to cheat, they're going to do it. It doesn't matter how good of a partner or how worried I am, or whether I try to prevent it, and at this point in my life that's not something I want to waste my energy on. I shouldn't have to police my partner's behavior to keep them from cheating on me or making me suspicious that they might, and if I did, they wouldn't be right for me anyways.	Since my ex I now use 'plates'(i.e. fuck buddies). I no longer care if any of those 'plates' cheat. Because it's an open relationship.	1
Is it rude to tell Indian co-worker that he smells very bad? He's a cool dude but it's soooo bad! How do I convey it delicately?	What does being Indian have to do with how he smells? I'm not being antagonistic -- I want to know if you're specifically concerned about his reaction because of cultural differences.	You don't. You go to hr and have them do it. It's not your job, and most jobs have grooming standards.	0
Men, how long did it take you to get over your ex? How did you do it? How long were you guys together?	Depends on the ex. Longest was like 3 weeks. Normal is two/three days, or whatever is closest to the weekend. What do you mean how? I stopped caring and slept with other people. Never had a relationship longer than 4 months.	It honestly took a couple of years. We were together for 4 years and I had already bought the ring. I just focused on bettering myself mainly. Learned a bunch of weird interesting hobbies/skills such as: lock picking, fencing, ballroom dancing, tae kwon do, racket ball etc... Really buckled down in school, studied hard improved my grade and got accepted into a great postgrad professional school. Got involved in clubs. Worked out. Volunteered. And I slowly started to realize hey. I'm an interesting guy who has a lot going for him. And each day I hurt less and less then one day I woke up and didn't hurt anymore. Soon after that I met my current girlfriend who is an amazing woman.	0
Women who have had abortions, how did you feel afterwards about the man who got you pregnant?	We're engaged (and got engaged afterwards), so obviously it didn't change much about our relationship. He was extremely supportive and very hard on himself about it all. I don't blame him at all, and if anything, he definitely showed me he can be relied on in a crisis. It made us closer if anything.	I have had 2. The first guy I resented definitely, but not because of that. He was just generally a bad person and no way could I ever have a baby with him, he was abusive. The second one, I do resent him, but it's really not his fault. I never told him anything about it, so my resentment is totally unfounded. Just a product of my own emotions, I guess.	1
Seeing your first pair of breasts in real life, how good was it?	If I'm gonna be truly honest. Seeing them is nice. But the coolest thing I did was touch one. I like to look at a nice pair. But mostly I just wanna lay my head on her chest and just breathe. If its all good, I might just relax and take a quick 20 min nap.	I was like 12 and this girl was flashing another dude. Her tittys were very tubular and pointed in opposite directions. I've seen many many tits in my life and those are still the worst pair I have ever seen.	1
What are your gym annoyances/pet peeves?	Not gym, but I've recently taken up just jogging around my neighborhood early in the morning. I do this specifically because I want to greatly minimize the chance that someone will actually see me running. So my greatest annoyance is running into the guy who just HAS to walk his dogs at 5:30 in the morning. Not to sound arrogant but I can't help but feel like he's watching my ass as I jog past. Ugh.	When the machine I'm using starts making really loud squeaky noises. Most people have headphones in, but occasionally someone doesn't, and then I feel bad :(	0
What is a hobby your girlfriend/wife has that you think is really cool?	to all of you idiots who think it's funny to post things like "my girlfriend is the hide and seek champion" or "invisibility, my girl has been good at it since i met her", just know that you're breaking [this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bu6qdq/mod_post_selfpitying_validation_comments_will/) and you've contributed to me closing in on the single-day ban record and for that i thank you. also get better jokes, you're not funny.	to all of you idiots who think it's funny to post things like "my girlfriend is the hide and seek champion" or "invisibility, my girl has been good at it since i met her", just know that you're breaking [this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bu6qdq/mod_post_selfpitying_validation_comments_will/) and you've contributed to me closing in on the single-day ban record and for that i thank you. also get better jokes, you're not funny.	1
What thing you added to your morning schedule that helped you a lot?	Making my bed. I won’t let myself leave my room in the morning without doing it. Then if everything goes to shit throughout the day, ill still have a nice already made bed to come lay in.	An earlier bed time. "But," you may start, eagar to point out the flaw in my statement,"d3jake, you devilishly clever man, that's a decision made *before* your morning routine. Tis a silly mistake, and therefore out enjoy men." Here's why. I had low ambition to get out of bed earlier and get more accomplished before work. I made an effort to go to bed earlier, and found I had time and energy in the morning to make a decent breakfast, pack a good lunch, and get out the door early. It all tracked back to getting to bed earlier.	1
When did you realize your friend group kinda sucked?	When almost all of them left my birthday party early. I later found out that they went to get pizza and see a movie and had planned it while still at my house.	When I asked them to hang out and they all either ignored the question or said no. After this happened ten times in a row over a period of several months, I just gave up.	0
When have you run into an Ex and thought "I won." or "I dodged a bullet."?	She was dressed in the most sleaziest uncoordinated outfit I have ever seen. Fashion is the first thing I judge, so I felt better about myself after I saw her (her eyebrows were popping though).	My college bf had an issue with drinking too much and peeing the bed. "A phase!", I told myself. Recently (ten years later), I hung out with him and some old great friends at a wedding. He got wasted, passed out on the couch of my hotel room, got up in the middle of the night, peed in my luggage and denied the whole thing. At least he has graduated to the corner.	0
Online Daters of r/AskWomen, what are some of your favorite icebreaker lines that you've received?	The only 'line' that I enjoyed was one guy who messaged me saying 'does it ever bother you that lobsters are immortal?' It definitely started a conversation about harnessing lobster genes to create a team of immortal super mutants. It ended up not going anywhere for other reasons. Otherwise my now fiancé messaged me asking who my favorite Sailor Moon character was. It was from my profile and wasn't the usual barrage of 'hi sexy' crap.	Ask about the latest Netflix original series or the latest pop culture event. For example, if he thinks Trump won the debate, you know to look elsewhere.	1
Guys of Reddit: Do you honestly look at females and think they are hot, even when you have a girlfriend?	It's human nature to check people out. It's nearly impossible to stop that, relationship or not. It's disrespectful for people to blatantly check others out in front of their SO and just not care what they think. But being attracted to what you're naturally attracted to doesn't equate to "he's gonna cheat." Don't worry so much.	I want the whiteknight mods of this sub to sotp putting these fucking ridiculous tags on every post that triggers them cause its not worded PC or whatever.	1
Women who have dated guys you knew were great for you but you didn't feel that romantically attracted to them, how did dating them turn out for you?	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities as we do not allow posts that limit responses to those from majority demographics. Everyone else, please feel free to respond based on the gender of partners you prefer.	I'm currently in this situation. Dammit, he's a great guy. He's smart and handsome and well travelled and likes all the same things I do...and I've just got nothing, no excitement to see him, no attraction. We've only been seeing each other for about a month and I keep hoping I'll suddenly get butterflies for him. Reading this thread is making me think I should just break it off now. Drat. :(	0
What is the quickest that a first date has gone bad?	I went on a date with a girl my friends tried to set me up with, she insisted on going to Denny's at 2am and I fucking love Denny's at 2am so I agreed. what I didn't know was that she planned it at this time so she could go out drinking and show up shitfaced. she told the waitress to hurry up so we could leave and she could "get fucked". she ended up going under the table at one point and when I'm embarrassedly like *please stop I'm so embarrassed everyone's looking I could die right here* she proceeded to scream that she's just looking for my panties. also she drove there herself and took up like 4 parking spots.	The second thing out of his mouth was: "U2 is my favourite band. I've seen them in concert 12 times" Nothing wrong with that, but they are not even close to my favourite.	1
How did you meet the girl you're dating and how did it start off?	I was born with her and I loved her ever since. It's the most loyal right hand you'll ever see.	We both worked at the same movie theater, but at different times. I had a party, and one of my friends brought her with. She started coming over all the time (we had a lot of parties). She was just a great friend. I started offering my bed for her to sleep in so she wouldn't drive home drunk, completely platonic. That went on for about a month, and then it gradually turned into a relationship. That was 9 years ago, we've been married for 6 1/2. We're getting divorced, but we have 2 awesome kids to show for it. Edit: Thanks for all of the kind things everyone has said. Didn't think this comment would get much attention at all, but the positive re-enforcement has been helpful. This community can be really great some times.	0
Posted something similar on AskWomen: Guys, what is an attractive trait in women that is undervalued by them, and what is an unattractive trait that is overvalued?	for me at least, punctuality (no idea if it's *actually* undervalued or not) is really attractive to me. I'm a dude who tries to run like clockwork. If I say I'm going to or told to be somewhere at X time, you better understand that I'm probably going to be early. If we're planning to leave somewhere at a certain time, we're leaving as close to that time as we can. If a girl is always late then I find it a little rude and somewhat inconsiderate. Maybe I'm a little too wound up, but I like being efficient and in my mind, it makes things run smoother.	Undervalued: Being skinny Overvalued: Fashion accessories Seriously, though, fat makes a girl drop off the dating radar. Lurking fat people can upvote "being skinny" all they like, but it won't change my preferences.	1
Women of color, is there anything popular TV shows or movies do to appeal to you that really annoys you?	I am loving the HBO series Insecure as F&@k. I started watching it out of boredom, but I was instantly hooked. I'm not the show's demographic (43 yr old white woman), but I love it.	I'm not a big fan of throwing the token "ethnic" person into the show who is super 2D. And worse, when they try to show either exaggerated versions of them in either direction (either they're the super stereotypical version of that ethnicity or they're the polar opposite like so unbelievably "white" it's too much). Is that what you were asking for?	0
How do you feel about Tennessee's new law that will criminalize women depending on their pregnancy outcomes?	My nephew was born 6 weeks early addicted to heroin and pain pills. She never faced jail time. He was taken away and given to her parents by the state. He was then given right back to her. My cousin finally got custody when he was 3. He couldn't walk and could not say more than one or two words. He had sores from being in a dirty diaper for so long that he spent three days in the hospital. If a mother uses illegal drugs while pregnant, I think they deserve years in prison. Anyone defending these people have probably never experienced what this shit is really like.	I think this is a symptom of the American Justice system trying to codify everything. We seem to treat making a law for something as the best solution, which is definitely not the case. It's the easiest to enforce, but ignores the larger societal problems that can only really be tackled with long-term change through education and reform.	0
In honour of Sean Spicer, what's your most embarrassing public speaking moment?	Not really public speaking, but I once said a friend's parent had her chest pushed down a bit because I saw it in an Asterix comic when younger without realising what it actually meant. Now I do, I will never be able to live that down.	At the end of my senior year of college I had to give a presentation on my thesis for one of my majors. I launched into a detailed analysis of Kant's influence on the evolution of studies/theories relating to epistemology. Then, I saw my major advisor stick his hand up above his head. I smiled and returned his air-high-five as I continued my presentation. Turned out, he was just signaling how much time I had left.	0
How do relationship fights affect men?	Simply put: for a lot of us, it takes time to process. For me, I need time to fully process emotions. I'm not the most in touch with them at all times. And also, I often realize later something that I wish I had said then, and if I deem it important enough, I'll want to bring it back up. Edit: also, it does affect us. I always feel slightly sick after a fight.	In the Myers-Briggs scale, I'm a T-thinking, but I feel very deeply, strongly. I just make decisions by thinking, not with my heart. That being said, when having a conversation/argument that involves emotions, it takes time to process that because when I channel emotion, I'm like a fire hose. It's all or nothing :D I don't trust myself to argue emotionally because it can get ugly quick.	1
What does rough sex mean to you?	Spank her, grab her, press her into the sheets as you stuff her, pull her arms when you enter, playfully choke her. Anything beyond that you need to get to know her better first.	>I've asked her what she likes and she's been pretty vague Yeah because part of her desire for rough sex is that she wants to be dominated. You asking her nicely what to do kind of defeats this purpose.	1
Anyone here ever meet a girl that was everything you wanted personality-wise, but nothing you wanted physically?	yes. It's horribly frustrating. I feel like a horrible person for being so shallow, but I want to be massively physically attracted to the person I'm with. I can't tell you how it ends. I'm in the middle of it now.	The whole "it's the personality that counts!" is such enormous bullshit; if there is no physical attraction present, you're doing both parties a disservice. When I extricate myself from my own predicament I might share my experiences/war-wounds.	1
What are your tips for asking a girl out?	* Use the word DATE unless you want to always wonder if she thinks its a date or just a hang out. End the confusion before it begins. * Have a specific time and date in mind. Don't just leave it out there. "Hey, I'd like to take you on a date to {place} this Friday. It'll be fun!"	Usually I just sniff my anus at a 45 degree angle, making sure to confer with my friends on the acidity of the smell, if it checks out then I grease my hair back, take two steps forward, three steps back, and ask the girl out while tipping my fedora and saying, "M'lady"	1
What downvoted comment you have written do you stand by 100%?	I said that we should outlaw elective abortions that are not performed for medical reasons. That and the following discussion got me a flurry of downvotes.	Buying someone Omaha Steaks is a decent gift for someone who loves meat. Buying someone twelve pounds of Wagyu from Costco for $900 is fucking ridiculous.	0
Women over 50, how is being a woman today different from when you where younger?	I feel like you should ask this in a group regulated frequently by said women. Look them up! They’re usually very helpful!	I had no option but to wear skirts to school until 8th grade. I couldn't take wood shop in high school. When I joined the Navy because I couldn't find a job outside health or childcare or food service, I was not allowed on ships. Nice girls didn't get tattoos, which is why "Show him the battleship, Janet" was so funny then. I remember when date rape had no definition or recognition. I was told if I accused him of rape, he'd get his friends to say they had all had sex with me too, so no one would believe me. That actually was a thing.	0
Men of Reddit, how did you figure out you that you are attractive/unattractive?	When I would play truth or dare with my friend group as a kid, none of the girls wanted to do any dares involving me, but they had no issues doing them with my friends.	When women walk up to you and say "my friend over here likes you" while laughing. It's obvious she's joking with her friend using you as the butt of her jokes. &#x200B; I hope women who do that end up having an ugly child or get cancer, either one is fine.	1
My wife doesn't understand why men constantly grab their junk. Let's hear some reasons to make her understand?	We do? Well, I don't. None of my friends do. In fact, I don't know a single guy nor have I ever known one to constantly grab their junk.	Tell her that we get “boob sweat” under our balls and we need to move things a bit to air them out.	0
