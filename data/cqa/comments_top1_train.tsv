Ladies, has a guy ever done something that made you want to dump him on the spot?	He was a veteran, and my friends and I have a sort of interesting sense of humor. My best friend and I high fived over not having kids (both got abortions in the past), he just turned to me and said "Wow, I've taken lives overseas and I can't believe you guys are celebrating killing a life". I honestly should have dumped him on the spot, but he ended up breaking up with me a week later. I have no idea what I was thinking when I was actually upset about it.	Watched him beat his cat. (for scratching on the furniture i think). Not just a tap on the nose, he punted the little guy across the room. Cat seems like he's used to this, but its no wonder he's terrified of people! I left AND i reported him for animal cruelty. NO clue if anything came about it.
How do you handle it when another guy treats your SO like shit?	I would straight up fight them, want to fight them, or would threaten to fight them. Assuming she's not an overexaggerating drama-queen or that it wasn't some kind of misunderstanding at least.	It depends on the girl, some girls want you to stand up for them, but I've found most girls want to fight their own battles. The answer isn't to protect her, its to support her, but what that means changes from relationship to relationship.
How many of you know how to drive a car with a manual transmission?	I never drive an automatic. I don't understand how people can be so lazy to not learn how to drive properly.	Whenever I meet a new girl I like. I ask her if she wants to shift gears for me. This follows by her not knowing how to do it and me handing her hand while helping her pushing into the next gear. Works everytime. Bitches love it.
"I feel so fat/ugly" - What is the appropriate response to these statements?	Gee, why would a woman feel fat or ugly in a society that tells her constantly that her entire value is based on her looks and she's not worth much?	I usually go with ignoring it, personally. Or switching topics. I find myself saying these thing sometimes because I... feel ugly? I mean. It's not that complex. I don't really care if the person I'm talking to totally brushes it off, it's fine. It's not like them saying "oh no, you're beautiful!" is going to make me feel any less gross.
At what point did you feel like an adult? Started seeing yourself as a woman rather than a girl?	I was sixteen. My aunt had just died, my mom was suicidal, my sister was having a really hard time in school, my dad was getting arrested (not that we even lived with him), and my grandma was just starting to show the signs of senility. I became the head of my house then. And all I could think about my life was that it was all very rude.	I'm 23, not yet. which is funny because I moved out when I was 15, got my first job while studying when I was 17. Have worked and moved further and further away from my parents and family. Had a long term relationship for 4 years that crashed and burned. Now I live in another country with what I'm pretty sure is the love of my life and yet sometimes when I call my mum to complain about bills or budgeting she just goed "Isn't it nice to feel like a grown up?". Pfth, I still feel like a 16 year old just faking it. I don't think I'll ever start feeling like a woman.
Stardew Valley players! What's your farm like? Who did you romance? What are you working on?	I made a orchard where I produce fuckton of fruit wines of various types. I also have a few animals of various types, including a void chicken!	OK, so I had never heard of Stardew Valley before this thread but looking through the comments, it sounded an awful lot like Harvest Moon which is one of my favorite games ever. I just looked it up and I think I'm in love again! Not that I need more convincing, but would anyone care to tell me what they like best about the game? If you've played Harvest Moon, what are some commonalities/differences? Also, can I only play it on the computer?
A male-only barber-shop as a "men's space"—what do you think of this idea?	Ever walk into a salon? A place where women go every month to have their hair colored and cut and whatever the fuck other voodoo they do? I dare you to walk in with a pair of balls and ask for a quick high and tight. I fuckin dare you. It's simultaneously hilarious and depressing that we have run out of actual problems in this society, to the point where we have to argue about whether the guys going to the barber shop is "socially acceptable." Ugh.	I don't see anything wrong with it. He's got an idea for his personal business and it's his right to see it through. and It's always a blessing finding places with a lot of experience cutting mens' hair
What's something you wished you could have done during your teenage years?	I wanted to do gymnastics when I was a kid (I wanna be a ninja yo!) but my dad thought it was too gay. What's gay about getting jacked and hanging out with mostly chicks? Idk. Reading your context though this probably doesn't help you. Just do anything you want man, you should be making the most out of *all* your weeks.	Gotten in shape. I was obese until I was 21-22, and it really sucked. You spend your entire childhood learning unhealthy habits, and it takes years of being nearly perfect in your habits to reverse it, and everyone treats you like a lazy piece of shit even when you're making progress because you're STILL fat after losing 50 pounds or more, and it really just sucks. People who had healthy households that promoted exercise and healthy eating instead of "no sports they're dangerous!" and goddamn fast food 3-4 nights a week because of one picky eater in the whole family are mostly fit because of circumstances surrounding their upbringing. Once you're a few years out of living at home you don't have much of an excuse but getting to college and having to make those changes was hard.
Men, do you get asked about wanting children and how do you deal with people's reaction when you say no?	All the time. I tell them I would instill the same dictatorship I have with my dogs and choke them when they get out of line. There is usually very few follow up questions.	Dating is a little tricky since it seems like most of the girls I meet around my age are looking to settle down and have kids at some point. People often say that I may change my mind, and I agree. I might very well change my mind in a few years. But today, right now, in this moment, I absolutely am not interested in kids nor am I planning for it.
What career certifications helped you the most and how difficult are they to attain?	Confidence. I know that isn’t the technical cert you were looking for but it has been the stamp of approval for so many things for me. I got my current job almost entirely on the back of being confident that I could do it and portraying that.	In IT. Really any technical certification that is general and in your field will set you apart from the competition. Anyone can say they have Vmware/Azure/AWS experience, but if you have certifications your resume will stand out. Also certifications generally command a 10-20% higher salary than non-certified professionals.
What are you still salty about years later?	Being sick the day of the Math Counts competition. I was the fucking captain. My best friend was the only other dude on my level on our squad. Like together we would have fucking wrecked the competition.	My friend from middle school was staying at my house for the night. She snuck in her boyfriend and they had sex on my beloved baby blanket that my grandma made for me. I wanted to give it to my children but now it's tainted in my eyes. I know it sounds silly but it still irks me 12 years later.
What well perceived comedy movies and tv shows really aren't that funny?	Parks and Rec is probably one of the least funniest shows that I have ever seen. Same thing with Community. That show only had 2 decent/funny characters.	I don't find Family Guy that funny at all. To me, it seems they don't even use humor that much. Instead, they rely on references and cutaways. That, and button-pushing...just seeing what they can get away with, trying to shock rather than amuse.
Aside from "live, laugh, love", what decor trends or items are you not a fan of?	"Respect everyone" or "live and let live" Now, in *general*, this is absolutely amazing advice when it applies to non-harmful cultural differences or whatever; however, I've seen it creep into safety vs. feelings* and people are saying it if someone's racist or sexist. In that case, no, absolutely not, fuck them. I will not respect bigots, thanks. ----- When I say "safety vs feelings", I mean something like "a trans person's safety versus a cis person's feelings". You could replace "trans" with any other marginalized group (POC, woman/femme, etc) and "cis" with any oppressor group (white, man, etc). ----- eta: this example is peak liberalism, tbh (and being the leftist i am, it is unacceptable to put "feelings" [bigotry] above the safety and well-being of others)	"In this house, we do ____." List of fourteen obvious things any decent person would do. Where did this thing even get started?
Girlfriend revealed that she's "not very sexually attracted" to me. But now she's super-sexual and affectionate, almost like she's feeling guilty. How should I respond?	> I considered breaking up with her but she begged me not to do it because "you're the best boyfriend I've ever been with, I love your mind and your personality and I'm okay with not being sexually fulfilled as long as you are fulfilled. Sexual excitement is just not very important to me anymore". <---- in her words. That's emotional blackmail, and you should dump her.	I wouldn't be able to get over this. Saying 'Well, I was more attracted to my ex boyfriends, sexually, but you're such a *good boyfriend*' would make me feel like a fucking loser. Some things are better left unsaid. What guy doesn't want to be sexually attractive to their girlfriend and WANTED by her?
Have you ever intentionally turned a girl off to avoid rejecting her?	That's how most of my relationships end. When I'm ready to break up I just fuck up for a couple of weeks until they dump me.	Sure I found out what her pet peve was and started doing it in front of her. She liked me and I had no interest at all and it was going to cause issues in a friend group. So I learned that she hated people who talked all the time about partying so I just mentioned it around her a lot and that made her lose interest. It could not have worked out better because she them moved on to my friend who liked her and then I was able to drop that act.
Men who were being abused in their relationship, what was your breaking point?	It was a long time ago and it really fucked me up for awhile as far as dating and women go. I was 19 in my first year of college and she was 17 still in high school and we actually shared an apartment together which auto made her the most popular person in school since she had her own place and people could come over and drink and do what kids in their late teens do. Well one such night in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell In a cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table. That was litterlly my breaking point. What if she did the same to me? Or a loved one, I don't know where she'd get the equipment, or how she's lure me up there..but that's when I knew it was time to go.	After about 1 year of hitting and slapping me, cutting herself and saying she would commit suicide if I Ieft, later I got news of her sleeping around with others. I confronted her, she cried said she was depressed and not her fault. I dumped her right there, and she broke a vodka bottle over my neck when I had turned around, she also knew that due to an older injury I can if I am unlucky get paralyzed from a hit on the neck. So... That was bad. I just blacked out and my neck hurts more after but not paralyzed at least
I’ve lost a lot of personal motivation in life after after getting into a long term relationship...if this has happened to you, how do you get past this?	Check out Jordan Peterson on YouTube. Greatly inspiring and extremely intelligent. He has a great book (12 Rules for Life). He also created a website (selfauthoring.com) that provides a great format for introspection. You are given a format to explore your past, present and future. It is a lot of writing but in the end, you have a clear understanding of who you want to be and who you don't want to become.	Sounds like your only motivation was to better yourself in order to get a relationship. Not uncommon. Now you need to find a new cause. You completed your goal, it's good to celebrate. But, if you don't continue to be the motivated person they fell in love with, they'll likely lose interest in you since you're no longer that person. So it's time to make new goals. Do you want more friends? A better career? To make more money? Take over the world? Build an iron man suit? Become the best ttrpg player at the Olympics? Sit down, write out a bunch of goals. Work towards them, you now have someone who has your back to help you reach those goals, nothing is out of your grasp.
Non-caucasian women: When you think of your life as it is today, which would you say you experience more - sexism or racism?	So a Caucasian women can't experience racism? As many has said it is often a combination. That I'm slutty because of my colour. With many from within certain cultures a Caucasian is worth less because of "low morals" which really just ebbs up in their view of sex. Wherever there is diversity a Caucasian is more likely to be raped. Just the fact that you excluded Caucasians from this post is racist. Especially the modern extension of racism which is one person being treated a certain way only based on the ethnic background of that person.	I definitely experience more sexism than racism, and I think there are two reasons. 1. I'm Native American, but people can never guess "what" I am so even in the unlikely event someone were racist toward me it probably wouldn't hit the mark 2. Sexism is still so ingrained in daily culture whereas racism is just so taboo nowadays that more people are actively avoiding being seen as racist. In other words, everyone is much more aware of racism than they are of sexism so they're correcting more for the former than the latter (yet anyway, there's hope for the future)
What are some lesbian-specific red/green flags?	Doesn't wear deodorant. Bras don't fit. Vagina smells bad. Super bad dental health. Any hygiene issue like that is usually an indicator of poor self-esteem or problems with money. I like a woman who takes care of herself.	Red flags: - Lesbians who don't like bi girls (ETA: and bi/pan girls who don't like lesbians or are afraid to be percieved as fully lesbian!) - Lesbians who can't be friends with straight people or gay men - Lesbians too focused on the gold star standard - Lesbians who say they're the 'man' or the 'woman' in the relationship. Especially lesbians who are trying to prove they're so macho that it's like a guy who's overcompensating by acting too 'manly', it's not their natural personality. Obviously it's cool if it's your actual personality. - Pillow princesses - Every ex is a friend, every friend is an ex. It's really notably present in the lesbian community. When I was dating, I tended to stay away from that clusterfuck as it always turned out badly for my best friend - Isn't out
Men 50+. Does your partner still give you blow jobs?	50 plus??? Are you kidding? That is so long ago I barely remember her name, but she had great attitude, skill and what more can I say without getting into spank territory? Your ideas about when age and decrepitude arrive need revising, Kid.	61 M wife is 63. Head, yes. BJ to completion...been a long time. And she will not let me go down on her, major body image issues.
White men. What is something about being white that non-white guys just won't ever understand?	This isn't unique to being white, but it's a different flavor for white guys: people assume you have no cultural identity, or that if you do it's super homogeneous *USian* culture. Any ethnicity you do have is generally washed out after a generation or two in the US even if your family tries pretty hard to stay insular within your ethnic group. Unless you adopt crazy strict cultural practices, your grand kids are just going to be white. Not Polish or Scottish, or Italian or anything else you might strongly identify with. They're white. Obviously this happens to dark skinned folks in a much more insidious and oppressive way. It's much less of a problem for white folks, but it's still a thing we see. It just plays out a little differently.	The fact that you're not allowed to call anyone on their bullshit if they have skin that's not white. The fact that you're not allowed to have opinions on *anything* even remotely race related.
What are personality traits in a guy are huge turn-offs for you?	Please feel free to respond about personality trait turn\-offs in the gender\(s\) that you find attractive. This question is not limited to only those attracted to men. Responses are welcome regardless of the genders you find attractive.

Have you ever walked out on a film at the cinema? If so which ones?	Batman v Superman - I actually walked out on this with my dad as it is without a doubt one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever hit theatres	I ended up walking out of the Green Hornet. I spent almost half an hour wondering when Ryan Reynolds was going to show up, and then I realized...
What was the grossest thing you´ve done this week?	I told my SO of four months "I can't believe we've been together four months already." It was on the exact four-month date from our first date. I felt so unbearably gross/cheesy. He made fun of me. I would have made fun of me, too.	Sewer line broke in the backyard...waded in a shit river to find the break. Husband tried to make me feel better by saying "At least it's our poop, babe!" That did not make anything better.

What are important things women need to realize about men?	That your career doesn't mean jack shit to men who have the means to take care of themselves. Men aren't attracted to the same things that women are. Men primarily want beauty/intimacy and cooperation/inspiration. Men of means don't care if your a fry cook or if your a lawyer because money to men who can take care of themselves and provide for a family don't need yours. If your a woman and your offended by this and ask your self the simple question.. What percentage of the financial load do you want to be responsible for your family for the rest of your life in a marriage? If you ever wanna be a stay at home mom or spend significant time with your kids after giving birth your going to have think seriously about this question and the type of man you want AND WHAT THEY WANT.	Stop fretting! If I'm quiet, it doesn't mean I'm mad. Maybe I'm thinking about work, or money, or you, or the kids. Or why I have goddamn ear and nose hair. If I'm upset, you will know.
What are hobbies/interests you love, but you dislike the associated community?	* **veganism/animal rights** I will leave it at that as redditers attack them all of the time so that they don't have to consider their message * **Programming/IT** I've met some incredible people. It is usually 50/50 from either meeting an exceptionally cool person or meeting a socially awkward, angry, exceptionally difficult person. Enough said, most of the "door number 2" types show up on reddit and are justifiably, routinely, criticized. * **Atheists** At least the contemporary internet atheist community. Neckbeard city, pretentious, emotionally stunted, gratitiously offensive. The arguments for supernatural beings are laughably easy to pull apart yet all of these guys walk around with their chests puffed out like they just figured out the mysteries of the universe. That last part goes for "skeptics" too. They get too much pride from the intellectual equivalent of fishing in a barrel.	I love League of Legends but their community is trash. I've never had to deal with anything because I'm a woman, but just everyone being shitty to everyone all the time. I love going to the gym and lifting weights. What I hate, especially on Reddit, is the whole "You just gotta be lifting bro!" attitude. "I have clinical depression" "Lift bro, that'll clear it right up!" "I'm having trouble grasping the author's meaning in this passage of Atlas Shrugged." "Bro, lift, seriously. I used to read Curious George then I started lifting now I read The Phenomenology of the Spirit for fun."
What is your most extravagant purchase? Something that you didn't NEED at all but bought simply because you enjoy it/desired it. Do you regret it?	When I first got divorced I went out and made a purchase that I kind of regretted. I left almost everything and in my mind I felt I deserved something that was nice, and my own. I built myself a $2,000 gaming rig when in reality I was in a financial position to only be able to afford a $750 one at best. I had huge buyers remorse at the time but am now okay with it now that the debt is gone.	$3k gaming computer; complete with a water loop. The video card alone was around $900. In hind sight I regretted it. It was so over the top, and the worst part was at the time I also helped a friend of mine build pretty standard midtier $1200~ machine that performed pretty much on par with mine. It was then that I learned that money only goes so far with computing, and after that it's just dick measuring.
For those that write in a personal journal/diary and that go back to read it, what have you learned about yourself?	From going back and reading a diary from roughly 4 years ago, I learnt that I had been battling some form of depression/anxiety for much longer than I initially thought. I've also learnt that more often than not the gut feeling that I have and write about turn out to be correct!	I go back and read from years ago. And I finally learned that time does dull a lot of things. Lost relationships that used to bring me to tears won’t anymore. I feel like it gives you perspective as to what the big feelings are that have stuck with you. And it tells you what was just situational small stuff. Also my memory is crap. I really don’t remember things I apparently experienced.
Men who are 50+, what has been your favorite decade of your life so far and why?	My twenties were pretty good in a sick way. I was British special forces, so I traveled the world and killed people. I'm now 61, and these last few years since I was 55 has to be the best. I'm single, my daughter has grown into a beautiful adult human being, (she's 20), and the single available women are sex fucking mad. I ain't complaining.😎😂	When I turned 50 my mother said to me "The '50s are the best decade" and I found her to be correct as I lived them. The '60s are nearly as good, and then in the '70s the downward slope begins as the body wears out very slowly. In the 80s things start to fall to bits a bit.
Have you ever said something to a woman in anger that totally changed the relationship forever?	Yes. I don't recommend talking when you're angry. But I don't think it's fair for a spouse with no job to complain that you're not cleaning up around the house.	Yes. I can't remember my exact words but it went something like "You're a gold digging leech of a person just like your mother."
What are the signs or red flags that a guy is only in it for the sex?	Guy here. Just wait, don't be specific about X number of dates or anything, just say you want to feel comfortable or something. Don't hold out on other means of affection, and consider getting pretty far without p-in-the-v so he won't wonder if you're the one playing him. MEANWHILE: Does he bring you around his friends? How does he treat you around his friends?	Usually the signs seem to involve them wanting to see you only when they feel like it and being really pushy when they do and about having sex. If all he does is want to meet you at his place or somewhere away from everyone and all he does in that time is try to initiate sex and he makes excuses to leave when he's got what he wants that's probably a definite sign. Some might be a bit harder to figure out but if in general it seems like you are their little secret then they probably don't think much of you and are only sticking around for the sex. Any relationship I had where it wasn't just sex they wanted to be out in public with me and show me off. Guys tend to love making sure everybody knows they have a girlfriend lol.
What makes your SO adorable?	he insists on cuddling me all night and pulls me back into him and kisses me if I have a nightmare	My wife is Caribbean and any time she gets excited or emotional her accent gets steadily thicker and thicker as she goes on. When we first met I couldn't understand her, so I would have to interrupt her and say 'English please!' but I started to pick up on it. It was really funny when she noticed this. "Whuh dey tink dey can come in mi yaad!" "Yea, screw them!" "Yea! Wait, you understood that?"
What is the douchiest thing about you?	I laugh at my own jokes, pretty loudly. &nbsp; Also that logic is kind of silly depending on how fit you are, clothing is obviously going to be tighter. Following that logic, people wearing clothing that fit them must be douchy? Weirdest assumption & logic I've heard lol. &nbsp; Sounds like an insecure person coming up with any reason to dislike someone so they feel mentally justified that they're still superior because they have a "better personality". ( I wonder if they see the irony in how shallow judging & assuming things about others is.) &nbsp; Dress how you want, don't let insecure people dictate how you should dress because they're going to make some comments. That's just the jealousy talking, ignore it, rock it, live & enjoy your life and watch them get angry/upset.	I try not to judge people by what they wear. I fail and constantly judge people by what they wear.
Do you think female masturbation is a taboo?	If it's wrong...I don't want to be right. I wouldn't say taboo is the word but perhaps "shameful" would be the right one. Maybe your parents catch you and you get scolded. But it is no where in the same ballpark of taboos such as blowing a goat.	Only just slightly more than male masturbation is. People who disapprove of one tend to disapprove of the other, but I think that most grown ups expect that masturbation happens.
Have you ever changed your mind on something you thought was a dealbreaker for you? What happened?	When I first started dating my dealbreakers were: must be vegan, must be feminist, must be Christian and must not want children. My partner had health issues that prevented him eating vegan, he's egalitarian rather than feminist, and he's Christian but not the right kind, so to speak. Eventually I stopped being vegan and stopped identifying as a feminist and deconverted from Christianity. So I guess you can say I broke all my dealbreakers on my own? We're still good on the no kids front though.	Not really a deal breaker for the relationship, but I always said I'd never move into a guy's place, he'd need to give up his apartment and we'd get "our" place. I currently live with it SO in a house he owns. What happened is I guess I got older, and met a great guy who had his shit together enough to buy a house. It was more or less move in or wait forever.
Women of Reddit, have you experienced more slut-shaming or virgin/prude-shaming? How has each affected you differently?	I'm a prude, I've only had one sexual partner. Even so everyone takes the time to call me a slut or whore, especially my mom. This has made me believe I am a slut but over the years I've learned that it's not true. If I'd had been prude shamed I don't think I would have felt as bad about it because I'd see my body as still clean and pure. I wouldn't be able to take anyone seriously and I wouldn't want to deal with anyone who dislikes the fact that I take care of my body.	Probably prude shaming, I wasn't a virgin when I started real "adult" dating but I also wasn't interested in hookups or casual sex, nor was I interested in celibacy before marriage or someone deeply religious. I caught a lot of shit from guys who didn't understand that there's a middle ground. They usually decided to make fun of me for it, usually while we were making out. Because THAT'S what's gonna make me wanna have sex. Very little slut shaming sticks out in my mind other than an incident where an Evangelical woman told me I was probably going to get raped for wearing a tight t shirt.
What's something you're ashamed to admit is attractive?	I like so many things. But very often when I say I like legs, boobs, butts, ears, hair, etc, I don't mean sexually. I really can appreciate a beautifull leg or butt without get aroused or think on sex. And I fell sad that I can't tell a women with a beautiful leg or butt that she has a awsome leg/butt, because sure she will call me pervert. Hard to appreciate beauty on women now a days.	I mean, not ashamed, but I'm hugely attracted to girls with tired eyes, like those permanent dark circles or slight bags that never go away. I honestly don't know what it is, but it is so damn attractive to me. Maybe it just gives the illusion of more depth...
Do you ever sit down and ,all of the sudden, you can smell your genitals?	I don't mean this to be cruel, but I don't understand why no one else would smell it if you do, through your clothes. If anything, people tend to have issues smelling themselves when others do. To answer, no.	This is what I call the "dank as fuck" moment even if it's not that moist down there (though it's more obvious when it's damp). It's so noticeable to me that I get paranoid that maybe other people can smell it too. It's that mix of sweat, vaginal secretions and that general genital smell (it's hard to describe that genital smell, I've smelled it on my boyfriend while giving head which made me think "oh gee, penises and vaginas really are of the same stock, even in scent! If I was going down on a woman would she also smell like this? I guess we all smell like this!") Ok I digress...
How do you start seeing yourself as a sexual being (and getting others to see you as such)?	This only applies if you're 18+. Save up, get a hooker, understand that sex is a transaction. Unfortunately you're on the heavy supply side with little demand. Now, if you're smart or good looking you can get it for free. The basics are: Look good, smell good. Be attractive, don't be unattractive. Manscape your crotch. Follow the three date rule unless you don't live in a major metropolitan area and "don't stick your dick in crazy". You've probably never loved or been loved so just remember, women hate that. Don't tell anyone you're a virgin. Fucking is like riding a bike: It takes time to learn, uses rubber, and you might hurt yourself a bit. Godspeed OP.	Are you a virgin? I honestly didn't start to think of myself as a 'sexual being' until I actually had sex for the first time (and then a few more times after that, since the first time was terrible). It took a woman actively wanting me to have sex with her for it sort of really click with me on a subconscious level that 'holy shit, there are women out there who want me to fuck them'.
What are some gifts that you have bought for your female family members or your SO that have been a big hit?	Hello... female here. Get us stuff to pamper us that we wouldn't buy. I like gifts of nice soaps, scented lotion and extravagant bath oils. And I only get these things when someone else buys them for me, because I either don't get around to the stores that sell them, or convince myself to spend the money elsewhere.	I like giving items in theme. So if I give a movie, maybe some snacks and a blanket too. Perhaps a book, book light and bookmark or slippers. Maybe a water bottle, pony tail holders, and new ear buds. Consider a classic mug, favorite drink, snack combo. If they have any hobbies, see once if you can find a high end magazine on the topic, maybe at a local bookstore (My personal favorites on art journaling and jewelry as well as other crafting topics are made by a company called Somerset Studio). If you have any favorite or meaningful photos, consider putting a few minutes into designing a magnet, mug, frame, photo book.
What "normal thing" today (relating to women) will look shockingly regressive in 2050?	“Non verbal cues”. No one should be expected to read your mind when you don’t verbalize your thoughts. That’s complete insanity	Lack of adequate parental leave in a lot of countries (...the US). The expectation that mothers should take a very small amount of unpaid time off then just get back to work. Also the fact that mothers are seen as the primary caregiver of children by default always, because of being female - that mothers get time off because they're expected to be the primary caregiver but fathers do not.
Women who have their nipples pierced, what's your experience?	It hurt. I've had mine for years... So all I really remember is that my leg flew up in the air and my piercer asked if I wanted the other done. I kept my eyes closed and told her "yes but hurry!" Totally worth it. Healing is a pain, but I love them and finding awesome jewelry for them. ;-) I had always been a bit ashamed of having a small chest, the piercings helped me reclaim pride in my body, to be honest.	>Do you like them? I love them! Don't regret it at all. > How much did it hurt? It hurt really, really, really bad. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. After the initial piercing the pain wasn't too bad, they were slightly sore for a couple hours and then they were just fine. > Was it worth it? Totally. The healing process is veryyyyyy long, and I still occasionally get little crusties on the jewelry (pretty much only happens after someone has put their mouth on my nipples during sex) but I think it was definitely worth it.
Did the words of the Santa Barbara shooter seem similar to some posters on reddit to you?	"Killing all of those women"? He killed two women and four men. The two women were random fatalities, while three of the four men were targeted. Can we please stop talking about this guy like he's the new Lisbeth Salander villain?	The last few days have been full of people contacting me, asking if I've heard the news about the shooter - and of course, asking if I'm going to snap and start shooting people any time soon. I guess that speaks volumes about how bitter I am at my lack of success with women.
Students of r/AskMen, what are you studying and what job are you aiming to get with that degree?	Philosophy and English. I'm aiming to be a lawyer, so I just need to keep my GPA up and practice for the LSAT. If I don't get into law, I can always teach.	Medical student, first year, i *hope* to be a doctor. I had the result of my first semester, i don't know how it works in the US but in France the access to the second year is with a ranking, i ended up the 430th out of 3000 students but they only take 230 students so i have to beat up 200 people in my second semester.
I just had to cut off the head and feet of a frozen chicken. Why do you need to cry today?	The guy I like lives on the other side of the planet and I can't see him until next year. 😭	I cried because I emailed my assignment to my class educator 1 day before it was due, and then the day after it was due, a full 45 hours later, I got a "delivery failed email" I've spent my entire holiday saving screenshots and calling my school, trying to prove that I did everything I was supposed to do and it wasn't my fault. Yesterday I got the official "Nothing can be done, please re-enroll" email. I can't afford to re enroll both financially and in terms of time.
When you go out to a club/pub on a Friday night, is it imperative that you should be with a group of people? Is it viable for an average looking single guy to go out at night alone and still drink, chat women up and possibly something more without coming off as creepy?	just go with friends, you'll have a much better time just dancing and having fun and meeting girls that way rather than approaching them and being creepy	Become a regular at a pub/bar. Then you can drink alone and you will still have friends there. If you are friendly with the staff they will be friendly back. When you are alone and the staff is all talking to you and paying attention to you girls at the bar will notice this and no longer consider you to be alone. I used to frequent a bar near my condo and I would get picked up by the waitresses and bartenders, usually when they finish working and the bar is still open because they know me and come sit beside me at the bar for a drink after their shift.
If you won the lottery, what's the very first thing you would buy?	Pay off the house for my parents. Put the rest somewhere safe. I like earning my own stuff and I wouldn't want people to know I won the lottery.	I'd buy a billboard, and have it placed in front of my boss' office window, that says "LATERZ" with a photo of me rubbing dozens of $100 bills on my face.
In all honesty, do you think sex is overrated? Why?	Cause getting to orgasm is like a maze sometimes and other times it’s a straight shot. When the partner isn’t up for it, I’m better of taking care of myself.	Yes and no. I mean, I have a high libido and will choose sex over almost any other activity. I still feel like a lot of society (and media) overplays the general importance of sex (gotta be having it!) and just how amazing it is (gotta do anything to get it!). If my SO left me, I'd certainly miss that part of the relationship, but I'd survive.
What does society claim is attractive that you find unattractive?	Lots of well-defined muscles. That just shows me they spend WAY too much time in the gym instead of doing something productive with themselves. The guy without a six pack has time to watch more Sherlock, read more books, go on more runs, explore the city, find the best bars, where the best hotdog is in the city, etc. edit: [Here's](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn2.stormgrounds.com%2Fstormgrounds-cdn%2Fmedia%2Fiphone%2Fiphone-Ripped-Guy.jpg&f=1) a picture of what I mean.	Long nails on women - I find it creepy and it makes my skin crawl a bit. (...let's also say long nails on men as well, to be fair)
What is the worst physical pain you have felt?	I mean all of these seem pretty bad, but last winter, I got a really bad case of the man flu. Pain all over. Nearly died.	When my L4-L5 disk ruptured leading to emergency back surgery. It felt like being stabbed in the back with a red hot poker and being ripped in half at the same time, 0-10 do not recommend.
Why are some women so reluctant towards receiving oral sex?	Now, not all people like the same things. And it turns out that WOMEN (seriously, calling them girls makes you sound like a pedo,) are people too. Some of them don't like oral. Really, you should actually talk to your partners about what they like instead of assuming they'll all like the same thing. In other words, it makes no sense to ask *us* instead of your partner.	Personally I always worried about how I looked down there, smelled, tasted etc. I know to me it's fine, but I didn't know what he would think while we're together. Also, that angle is like the worst because my stomach is right in his face. So mainly it's insecurity. But once I did it I absolutely love it now. Some women are just different and don't like it. It happens.
What's your "one simple trick"?	When you don't hear what a person says the first time, say "I can't understand you when you mumble." They will immediately think you're an asshole. Unless you say it with a smile in which results may vary. I don't know what I was getting at but I just find this response hilarious and want more people to use it.	After a shower, squeegee yourself off with your hands before reaching for the towel. Kinda like wiper blades on a car. You dry off 90% quicker and the towel doesn't get soggy.
How do I level up?	Unfortunately I believe that is just an issue with the era we find ourselves in. Due to the older generations of men having been a bunch of evil jackasses, most young men today are afraid of approaching women cause of the stigma of "men bad" that the media likes to propagate.	>How do I level up? Be clear and upfront in what you want and don't settle for less. If you're looking for a relationship and X is looking for something casual, clearly X isn't the right person for you, turn the page and continue searching for what you want.
When does a breakup hit you the hardest?	I'm a girl but I feel like I respond slow, I'm just numb. Yesterday, actually, my boyfriend and I were arguing - it was me, calling it quits... He was so so upset that I felt like the bad guy and later we made up. I feel really guilty but I wasn't in the wrong but I admit I regret calling a break up without the balls to go through with it.	It hits me the hardest when I finally take a look at my other dating options/revive the online dating profiles and remember how bleak it is out there.
What would $100 get you in your hobby?	I'm a dude, and $100 would get me absolutely nothing since i make edm tracks on my computer. A new daw would cost around $600+	About a sweater's quantity of yarn, maybe a bit less. At least most of a sweater's worth of yarn though!
Men of Reddit, what are some things you do to maintain your own well being and happiness?	Compare the old me to new me. Muscles, money, confidence, friends and am about to buy my first house all at the ripe age of 19. :) Edit: LSD is also good	I like to do cooking projects. Spending a couple hours in the kitchen whipping up something new is cathartic for me, plus I get to eat at the end of it all.
Guys in their preteens or teens, what have you been taught about "how a man should be"? What's it like being a young man in 2015?	Talking about gendered norms, we are getting to the stage where it is not necessarily considered a good thing about a guy for him to be a feminist. Many girls are anti-feminist themselves. Which is, frankly, hilarious. Edit: Yep, downvote because it has the word 'feminist' in it. Well done.	18 year old from Holland here >Are there emotions that are "unmanly" to feel, or display? Jealousy I'd say >How are you expected to treat women? Respectfull, not different from men tbh >Are there any online norms that are gendered? What do you mean? >Do you feel like "becoming a man" is an important aspect of your life right now? Not at all >What are the issues young men are facing currently? Shyness I'd say, for women it can be seen as cute, not for men
Men of Reddit. I was just informed by my wife that I am going to be a father. I was very supportive when she told. However, inside I am freaking out. I know I must be strong. But, dear god help me survive this. What do now?	I'd talk to my pregnant wife about how I'm feeling instead of making a Reddit thread, but that's just me. Remember: she's the one who's pregnant. You think you're scared?	The easiest way to fake your death is at sea. Charter a boat, take a ride when storms are forecast. Have someone else meet on a second boat and sink the first boat. Start new life on beach of your choosing.
What's the worst negative metamorphosis you've seen somebody go through?	On a totally shallow and physical level, a few of my friends at school have done a reverse uglyduckling. One girl has gained loads of weight, grew loads in height but nothing else, gotten really sweaty and greasy, got a really bad haircut, developed bad posture and has made some seriously questionable fashion choices.	A girl that was a close "friend" of mine in middle and high school turned into a nasty shit to me when I came out. In college she came out herself, and actually became more homophobic towards femmes, and is essentially the Boo stereotype. Also, this salesman I know named Gregor turned into some sort of giant insect like creature.
Is it common for girls/women to do all these things without liking you as anything more than a friend?	You're not supposed to TELL her how you feel, you're just supposed to SHOW her how you feel by escalating (slowly). If she puts your hand on her leg, start rubbing, etc. ..	How old are you? From your post I'd guess high school, first year of college at the oldest. To me it sounds like this friend of yours is just enjoying your male attention and doesn't want more than that from you for whatever reason. It's a maturity thing most likely. All women are different, so of course you can't generalize and say they'll all be attention-hungry. Since she's rejected you, it's now up to you if you're going to continue hanging out with her or find a girl that wants you for more than a headrest.
What is the one thing that bothered you throughout your 20s and no more now?	Being a virgin into my late 20s. Now, as a virgin in his 30s, I kinda wish I were a late 20s virgin again.	I was generally just way more self-conscious in my early 20s. I'd always feel like I was being watched, or like I had to impress everyone I interacted with, or like everyone was judging me. I finally realized that literally no one cares. I don't remember what the stranger I bumped into at the grocery store last Tuesday looks like, and they almost definitely don't remember me either. Life is a whole lot easier now that I don't feel embarrassed and self-conscious all the time.
If you think about someone you interact with regularly you don't like, what is the biggest reason you don't like them?	Co-Worker: She has a high-school education, a white trash life, is completely two-faced, runs crying to the manager if I'm "mean" to her, can't do her job, but still criticizes my work, and earns double what I do. I might be a snob, I can admit it, but I should not have to explain myself to such a horrible little person.	Everything revolves around him. I've never once seen him consider anyone else's needs or wants. He's quite literally the most selfish person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting.
What's a common or popular feature in a house you really don't like?	Not in the house, but the yard. I will NOT by a house with more than two trees in the yard. Leaves are freaking awful and if you don’t get rid of them, they get tracked through your house by kids, visitors, your dog, etc. If you do spend hours getting them up, a week later, your yard is covered AGAIN. Repeat every damn week for a month to months depending on where you live. Freaking hate leaves...	I'm not sure if it's a trend just where I live, but master bathrooms with no door. So many of the master bathrooms around me have the toilet in a separate room and then the sink/shower area connected to the master without a door. I hate it because if you and your partner have different schedules one is basically guaranteed to wake the other up getting ready in the morning - especially if they take morning showers. And then the whole bedroom gets hot and humid after a shower. I don't know why they're so common.
What about your relationship did you not realize was unhealthy until after you broke up?	I didn't recognize that a 26 year old willing to date a 17 year old was weird. No matter how "mature" I was at that age, I didn't realize how gross it was until we broke up... 7 years later.	I didn't realize I was trying too hard to be a good girlfriend and sacrificing my own need. It was ultimately unkind to both of us, and I ended really hurting him when I broke up with him "out of the blue" when I couldn't keep it up anymore.
Men of reddit, what advice would you give to someone who's never been in a fistfight?	Get a pad. Put it on your forehead or cheek and assume a fighting stance. Have someone hit the pad lightly. Then get a bit harder. You are going to get hit. Understand it.	If possible always try to disengage. Fights are not worth it. Its pretty easy to do lasting dmg or reciev. Just need to fall wrong on your head. If you are forced, cornered or have not other option. Fight to win and not to show of. Its not a movie, no fancy move or other shit. Bites, Eyepokes, punches to the balls. Everything is allowed. Do what is necessary to be safe. And one other advice. Never headstomp. Its not worth to go to prison.
How often do you cry?	I feel as though a lot of you are either trying to sound like badasses or have some emotional blockage you need to deal with. Just saying. I cry semi often. Used to be that I hadn't cried for a period of about four and a half years. From age 13-18. Then I realized I was overcompensating for certain traumas and stuffing my emotions. Then I cried over everything that needed a good cry. Now I would like to think I cry a fairly "normal" amount. Of maybe a handful of times every couple of months.	Every few months when it's late at night all my bottled up feelings come out for about 10 seconds. Then it's back to bottling them up.#Nurture
What’s a one thing that makes you think “I might be a super shitty girlfriend”?	He'll give me the world if I asked him to. He's paid to fix my car, treated me to an awesome birthday, washed and put away MY clothes while I was at work, and so much more. However, sometimes I groan if he asks me to do something for him, like wash his back or to order something online for him. I wish I wasn't so selfish. He really is the bomb. :(	I’m not the girlfriend anymore, but after my ex and I broke up, I started to really realize how bad some of my behaviors and habits were and it positively mortifies me. I was very clingy and not understanding enough, and I let my depression and anxiety take me over and ruin our relationship. It makes me extremely embarrassed to think about the things I did.
Couples who married young (18-21), how is your marriage now?	I'm 21 he's 25, been married 2 months. :) I don't have any regrets. I love him, our beautiful house & two doggies. We have our ups & downs like everyone but I would love to see 10, 20 years in to the future and him still be there. I don't want to be married more than once. I'm happy I settled down. I met the perfect person for me and I only hope we can have a long happy life together.	I got a Lass pregnant when we were both 19, I decided I'd better do the "right" thing and marry her. We've been married 12 years now and have 2 kids and it all worked out alright in the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.
What common misconception within your field of expertise do you want to clear up?	Tipping is not an option. It is customary in the United States to too tip your servers because most of them make $2.13 an hour. Tipping is what allows restaurants to serve you. Tipping is the reason your food is high quality and you get everything brought to you. Servers are already basically catering to your every need and if you don’t directly tip them you are taking advantage of someone.	That lawyers are rich. Most of us who aren't in white shoe firms are certainly not that. Also, a good amount of us fake it until directly called out. Listening to a real estate attorney talking about constitutional law can be as bat-nanners weird as say, a butcher or store clerk talking about it.
What convinced you to stop wanting to get a girlfriend?	Freedom. The realization that literally every day there's a women turning 21 so why settle with just 1? What am I? A clown!? 🤡	I'm lazy and what little free time I have I don't feel like spending it with other people I just want to relax and enjoy my hobbies.
What will you not pay more than $20 for? And what can you not imagine paying less than $20 for?	Won’t spend any more than 20$ on clothing. Why the fuck does it have to be so expensive! I can’t imagine paying less than 20$ for a computer.	Respectively: a trip to the cinema, and shoes for work. I work at a nightclub, and am thus constantly on my feet. The floors are very wet and sticky too. I need boots that can withstand that.
Whats something men shy away from due to gender norms that you find absurd and impractical?	* In general, just liking stuff and being excited about it if it's not sports or killing something. * Pegging * Drinking "girly" drinks - we've even gendered our alcohol! You don't need to suffer through scotch if you don't like drinking peat, it's okay, have a daiquiri. * Wearing clothes to please themselves, or really engaging with fashion as fun. * Crying. * Asking for help, or getting the help/treatment they need. * Being the dude that stops perpetuating toxic masculinity. * Standing up against misogyny. * Talking about periods. Gender roles are the fucking worst.	Skincare. Especially when it comes to dry skin. That shit is uncomfortable, and no one is going to take your man card away for moisturizing.
Do people on Reddit typically assume you're a man? How do you respond?	It's sort of my fault since I picked a really lame username...my fiancé dared me to do it and I didn't realize I couldn't change it later on. I haven't responded yet since I haven't come across anything too out there.	Yea I got called a white knight. I asked if I was still white knighting if I was a woman. Never got an answer so I still don't know
Men of reddit, do you believe in "you have to love yourself before you love someone"? If so, why?	If you struggle to love yourself then your personality won't be able to adapt to love someone else's personality. If you can't handle your own thoughts and emotions then you won't be confident enough to handle someone elses.	No amount of external validation is gonna silence the little voice in the back of your head that says "I'm not worthy, they're lieing to be nice, they don't really like me". You have to do that yourself.
What's a habit that you picked up from your ex that you still do?	When dealing with a woman that attempts to rant, I kiss her to silence her. Odd habit I picked from my ex.	Not to set the alarm clock to something like the full, half or quarter hour, but always a few minutes off. No idea why, but I like it.
I know it's unhealthy but do you guys ever hold in your emotions to avoid an argument with your SO? Why?	It really depends on the argument. Sometimes I want to be calm and collected when discussing something serious. Acting on my feelings would only make my SO shut down and we wouldn't get anywhere. Other times I let every emotion I am feeling show. Because he needs to see how something has affected me. My SO almost always holds in his emotions. But he was taught to. He grew up and his parents never gave a single thought to his feelings or made him feel bad for having them. So he learned showing emotion is pointless. He's getting better about it.	All the time. Sometimes I overreact if I run away with my emotions, so I generally take a couple deep breaths, press it down, and unless it still bothers me later, I just let it go. Not all fights are worth fighting.
Women who have had bad anxiety about eating in front of others (especially in front of men), how did you overcome it?	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
Women of Reddit how do you get rid of guys who don't take ' No' as an answer?	If you say “No” and the person won’t accept it, it is not your business to make them happy. Walk away. The reason people refuse to accept No for an answer, is because that want you to change your No into Maybe, and finally a Yes. The problem is, your initial/right/true/intuitive response was No, and they failed to respect it. The problem lies with them, not with you. Those who know no boundaries, no honor, no respect are really good at letting a No fly over their head, and continue to insist to get their way. Psychos are especially skilled at that. Just ask any victim of violence. And that’s why it’s not your responsibility nor obligation to deal with such people. There are a lot of respectful people in the world who’d enjoy your company and be honored by your presence.	I get really, really gross. One dude at a bar didn't take no for an answer. I was drunk so when he said, "I got a pocket full of condoms." I blurted back, "And I've got a pussy full of blood." He actually physically retched and walked away while I cackled.
Hey, fellow ladies. DAE have a hard time letting rampant sexism in Reddit go?	I don't have much problem with sexism, but more with the thinking of a huge mass of young people with very little wisdom. These youngins will simmer down as they get older. However, I love being around and talking to younger people, because they are often so full of exciting ideas and hope. Now get off my lawn.	Reddit's sexism is exactly why I won't post pictures of myself with my "real" account anymore. The most karma I ever got with that account was from a picture of me that (shocker!) happened to include my breasts (low-cut top; nothing obscene). While it received tons of upvotes I found the comments infuriating. Accusations of being a whore of one type or another, degrading/immature comments about my chest size, and lots of downright creepy comments. I had to scroll down more than half a page before anyone even mentioned the purpose of the photo (I had met a semi-celebrity and it was a picture of me standing with him). I find reddit a lot more enjoyable now that I never even mention my gender on my real account anymore.
I'm sick of reading relationships horror stories on /r/relationships and elsewhere. What are some of the reasons you love being in a relationship?	We ran out of tortillas so he made me nachos. Omg. Now he's chilling with our 2 year old while I take a short break. He's awesome.	My fiancé is my best friend. Being in a relationship to me is like living with my best friend who I can also fuck and it's awesome.
As a woman, how should I state my height preference when online dating without sounding like an ass?	If you're tall then you can say "only interested in men my height." Honestly why are you worried about being a dick because you have a preference? I got a lot of hate messages because my profile explicitly said "no fatties" but he only people who ever got pissed about that were...you guessed it, fatties. If the only group of people who is going to take offense to your preference are the type of people you don't want to date then fuck'em. That's their problem not yours. Don't be afraid of being a dick OP, short dudes are just mad at the world anyways so who cares.	As an extremely butthurt short guy, "I'd prefer someone at least my height" is ok. Sure, I'd curse God, world and mother nature if you were painfully beautiful, but I wouldn't mutter "Fuck you, bitch", like I probably would if you were shorter than me and put "no one under 6'0" in your profile.
What’s the longest it has taken you to get over someone?	Just a couple of days, really. The only frustrating part is that I still haven’t found a rebound girl yet. E: why is this getting downvoted?	Fair warning: Don't read these comments if you just got dumped and want some assurance that everything will be OK.
Women with IUDs: yay or nay?	Skyla checking in! Was on oral contraception for a few years about 4 years ago. Was without since. Tried Nuvaring on doctors rec and it was the worst month ever! Went with Skyla iud once the issues were treated, and I've had it for a few months. The insertion was very uncomfortable but not painful or scary. The cramps were quite bad here and there for 2 days. Spotting pretty consistent but getting better. Period lighter and easier, diminished pms symptoms which is good. And I'm losing weight, have great skin, and all the things that made oral BC and Nuvaring not work for me aren't a problem with the iud! PLUS I still have a good sex drive. Yay!	I have mirena. My sex drive went way up, my periods are usually light, and for the most part I can't even tell it's there. However, it caused me to break out around my chin (never had problems with acne while not on birth control or on the pill). I occasionally get pretty bad cramps that seem to come out of nowhere. It probably needs adjusted. And doggy style feels like he's falcon punching my uterus, usually.
[UPDATE] My boyfriend is a groomsmen and the groom has chosen a suit that is $500. Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?	I am aghast that anyone would believe any J. Crew's products are worth more than $50, tops. Those guys should go to a real tailor.	It's one thing choosing a $500 dollar suit for yourself, but an entirely different one if someone else has to do the same.
Women who didn't take their husband's name, how did you make that decision and what lead to it? Are you glad you still have your maidenname?	You know what would be cool? If when we get married we smushed the two last names together in a mutually agreeable way.	Not married yet, but I won't be taking his name. I see no reason why I would want to or what purpose it would serve for us. And I'm known professionally by my name, in an industry that is 90% based on networking, familiarity, and reputation. Changing my name would confuse that. I also love my name and love my family. I'm happy to have my name. I can't see any circumstance in which I would regret it.
What complaint about men are you absolutely sick of hearing?	I have a bunch but I guess I'll stick to this one, since it directly pertains to me: The idea that older men who seek out younger women (18+ obviously) are gross. As long as everyone is consenting, those people can fuck off and mind their own business.	That men aren't empathetic. What a bleak outlook on half of humanity to say that they don't have something that is universal to human expirience.
What is it like moving to a completely new city alone?	Hey man! I just moved to Vienna alone. Expect your friends to act like they care but as soon as you are away they won't give a shit bout how you are doing. But after a long cry alone, you'll be fine. Gives you a lot of opportunities, and hey what else is life for? Sometimes you need to be alone to find yourself and do what you always wanna had done. Don't be afraid, be yourself! You have the bravery to make that move, that alone should tell you you are special. Go on and imagine all the good things that may happen. What would it help to stay where you are?	It sounds awesome at first because of the thrill of moving to a new city. Then it sucks for a while because you realize you don't have any close friends and the closest people you have are thousands of miles away. You cry and spend time alone in your apartment. You realize you can't do this forever. It slowly starts to get better as you start making new friends and putting yourself out there in the new city. TL;DR: It's awesome at first. Then it sucks for a while. It gets better though. Source: moved from San Francisco to Chicago.
Women who have adopted a child who is older (6+), what was your experience?	I have not adopted myself, but I've heard a lot of families recommend reading the book "The Primal Wound". Apparently it's fantastic for helping adoptive parents understand the issues that an adopted child faces.	I personally have not adopted a child, but I was a child who was adopted at the age of 12. I don't know if you would like to hear about it from the other side or not?
I've been told men are more confusing than women. So what is the most confusing thing you experience men do?	Why can't you plan ahead and multitask?? Do you need to wait for the morning of your business trip to wonder if your suit is clean? To pack your bag and look frantically for your passport when you should have done all this the night before? Can't you go to the bathroom as I am getting our son's shoes on while you stand there looking at us, instead of waiting until we are in the car and waiting to go? etc...	Why talk to me and act like it's going somewhere when you're going to say "Oh actually, I'm busy and I can't be in a relationship" You *knew* you were busy before you asked me out. Why ask me out? Or maybe just be honest say "I didn't feel that much chemistry...sorry" It would sting a little but piss me off less than doing something illogical. While being in relationships: Not telling me stuff. Not that I need to know every little detail of your day, but when you say "Oh I'll be at your place in 15 minutes!" and you decide to check your facebook, take a shower, play a round of Bloons Tower Defense, and 11:30 turns into 1:15, I get worried. Cut. Dat. Shit. Out.
Is it weird to text a girl that didn't give you her number?	I would strongly discourage you from texting her. Find another way to contact her a little more naturally. Even sending her a message on Facebook, or having a mutual friend (not the one you mentioned) pass a message that you were looking to get in touch. I couldn't imagine and out of the blue text message going too well.	I don't see anything wrong with "Hi, I'm whty, roommate's friend. He gave me your number." and reevaluating based on her response. Just don't make it a sexual initial text.
Women who regularly go braless, how do people treat you?	From a dude's perspective, I doubt I'd even notice. Unless you're wearing something sheer, or your bust size lends itself to obvious movement, I dont generally find myself all that curious about what sort of undergarments you may or may not be wearing. On an unrelated note, are you a spider?	No one really cares but I am very small up there. Some guys do think it's "hot", and a couple people have asked me why I went bra less but it never has been a big deal. You should wear a bra tho for job interviews. I had an employer look straight at my nipples once.
What makes you NOT want to get married?	Marriage is a trap. You go in thinking it's forever and love is beautiful. You bind yourself legally to one another. Then it falls apart and you have to pay enormous amounts of legal fees and go through hell just to get out of it. If I could give one piece of advice to my younger self it would be DON'T DO IT!	It’s frightening. The emotional and financial risks of divorce. The prospect of a partner changing in unpredictable ways that may or may not drive you apart.
What is the most bizzare racial slur you've been called?	I am white and was called "just a white person", "you are just white people", "you do white people things like having bbqs". All this was said angrily to me when I told a friend I thought he was a womanizer and needed to get his act together (I should have just stayed out of it). I always thought that was odd.	Working customer service at the time, I was called a McNigglet, definitely the most original one I've heard directed towards me
Fans of Bon Appétit, how will your consumption of their material change after today's news, if at all?	I don’t care, unless they’re putting blackface in the recipes or something. I don’t follow recipes for their creators politics, I follow them for their taste.	Adam also confused Sohla and Priya in a talk... yeah. I think the whole pay thing is really shitty. Hawa, who is no longer working with BA, was only paid $400 per video. That, Alex Lau’s (old BA photographer) experience, and the race issues on/off screen proves how much BA needs to change. I’ll follow the hosts anywhere they go and they all seem genuinely invested but again... shame on BA. Edit: typo
When was the first time you had unprotected sex?	Good for most of y'all. I literally have never had sex with a condom. I lost my virginity at 13 and now I'm 21 with 20+ bodies. I know I'm stupid. Don't follow my step. It's a habit I'm actually trying to break now	Without a condom- my college girlfriend, around 21. She was on the pill. It was awesome. Life changing. Even though I had to really train myself not to finish in thirty seconds. Without any protection- hasn't happened yet, even though I have kids. But I'm getting a vasectomy this year, so my wife can have her IUD out next year. Looking forward to shooting blanks, especially because we had two sneak past the goalie already.
Engaged/married women of Reddit! How long into your relationship did your SO propose, and how old were you?	We met at age 17, moved in together at 19, formalized our engagement at 28, and married at 29. The first discussion of spending our life together happened at 19 (I brought it up). There was no traditional proposal; we mutually proposed, it was not a surprise, there were no engagement rings.	He proposed at two months. We were 21 and 26. We have been married for 30 years. That man is the best thing to happen to me.

What do you feel so passionate about that you tend to end up arguing over?	Incest. It pisses me off to no end that people have a problem with it. People say it's bad because of... 1. birth defects, because apparently natural birth is mandatory in all sexual relationships. Try telling that to a gay person. 2. the fact that incestuous sex often involves minors. Kind of like how every gay priest fucks little boys, right? 3. the "ew" factor. Because if you don't want to fuck your cousin, it's wrong for anyone to. Kind like how being gay is wrong because I don't want to fuck another dude, right? I firmly believe that anyone who thinks homosexuality is fine but incest is wrong has zero critical thinking skills and simply blindly internalizes whatever the liberal media tells them.Two consenting adults should be allowed to have sex in fucking 2016. Period. I will literally fight you over this.	Any time people quote some pop psych book, article in a mainstream news magazine that poorly summarizes a published journal article or worse the musings of some blogger with 5 credits of undergrad psych, and start talking as an expert on behavior/neurology/the human condition, I have to remind myself to just bite my tongue and walk away. Especially on forums like reddit, people don't actually want to learn and see the prevalent models and theories used by mainstream psychology, psychiatry, and neurology... they just want to cherry pick interpretations of further cherry picked sub-results to further their agendas. They feel this is a-ok because psychology, medicine and biology aren't real science anyway. Don't even get me started on when people use a single correlation buried in a table of exploratory stats and start saying "see science proves x causes y!!!".
Did you get married with no bridesmaids? How was it?	I had two bridesmaids but they both sucked. Never went dress shopping with me. Never offered support. Never helped me get ready. Never fulfilled their duties except for showing up. In retrospect, I should have gone without them!	Wedding photographer here. Ive got two or three weddings this year with no bridal party, just the bride and groom. It seems to be a growing trend the last few years and naturally I'm okay with it because it's less work for me and puts more emphasis on the actual couple getting married. If you have none and your SO has two then that will definitely look different for sure.
Pet owners: What does your pet do that makes you smile?	My kitty is a complete and total cheese fiend. Any cheese left unattended in the house is his. He's not as pushy about getting food from you as some cats, but he's really sneaky. He'll try to lull you into a false sense of security by being super snuggly, then take a lick of the cheese while your guard is down. Either that, or he'll remain out of sight and when you forget and leave the room for a minute BAM he's face deep in your cheese. There have been times when he's been so sneaky about it the only reason I knew he'd done it was the tongue marks on my cheese.	I'm so sorry for your loss. My dog makes me smile every time he sits down. I don't know what has happened to his body as he's aged, but he always lets out a fart when he sits or lays down, and then he looks over his shoulder like "what the fuck was that?" I don't know why, but this still cracks me up every time.
What's your favorite psychological theory or phenomenon?	The greater the inequality in laws toward women and the less women are allowed to participate in public life, the worse the male collective behaves internationally: everyone suffers. This is both psychological and anthropological.	I can't really explain why but object permanence (or a baby's lack thereof) always makes me giggle. I just picture a baby playing peekaboo going "oh my god mom no!"
What's a TV/movie relationship that everyone thinks is great but you don't agree?	Walter White and whatever his wifes name was. I watched that show a long time ago, but I can remember hating on her so much, she was such a drag.	Tris and Four. There’s just a lot of manufactured drama. They were constantly mad at each other for who knows what, and then they’d make up, and two minutes later they were mad at each other again. But I was never a big fan of the books, particularly allegiant. I felt like it was all manufactured drama, so I suppose their relationship would be the same.
What is the best example of double standards that you have witnessed?	The rising tide of "guilty until proven innocent" situations when it comes to rape accusations. A woman who claims "rape" is to be believed with little to no evidence. The man accused must prove his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt to not face consequences. I'm sorry, but putting the power to destroy someone's life in the hands of a vengeful person, male or female, is irresponsible and wrong.	Praising sons for being sexually active but feeling the need to protect daughters from guys because "they know how guys think" Encouraging girls to do traditionally masculine things (wear pants, male dominant careers, watch sports, yadaydada) but discouraging boys from participating in traditionally feminine things (wear skirts, play with baby dolls, female dominant careers, cry)
How do I tell my girlfriend that her screaming during sex is a huge turn off?	Loud girls usually have it a turn off to not be loud. She might like the pillow trick or the ball gag, never hurts to explain your preferences and propose to explore solutions. But it looks like you two have incompatible sexuality.	Invest in a ball gag. Tell her its so you can spice up your love life. But you'll know what it's for.
Stolen from ask men: What is a something about your partner that you are able to tolerate but you are sure the majority of others wouldn't?	My hubs has anger problems and is very aggressive. For the most part he is not abusive with me or our son but at times we had have fights. We haven’t had a fight in over a year. It’s less intense now that we are both heavily medicated. But during our first year together I contemplated leaving several times. Aside from his anger isssues, he’s the person I have had the most compatibility ever: from musical taste to sex. He’s also my second husband, btw.	He makes terrible jokes. We’re talking sitcom Dad level puns. Usually I find it cute, but occasionally I wish the ground would swallow me whole out of embarrassment.
What is a time you have witnessed a secret blow up in everyone's faces?	I worked with a chick who had a boyfriend in another country LongDistance. so while she was in that she started dating my BIL, then the LD came to visit for a while and by some weird coincidence she got pregnant like a week before he came so when she pretended like it was his but went and got an abortion and continued this weird relationship with both of them... eventually the LD found out i think it was by some text or something she left open on her iphone which connected to her laptop and the guy was furious broke up with her treated her like shit afterwards.... I always thought he was a good guy and never deserved that but I couldn't tell him anything because then i'd have to deal with her every day at work...	My sister's multiple affairs came out when my dad was in the hospital. We were all sitting there for hours, and she kept getting different phone call "rings" in front of her then-husband. Then 'friend #1' stopped by, then 'friend #2' stops by... she was milking the 'my father is in the hospital' pity card and it backfired because all three showed up at the same time at the hospital.
What does your girlfriend do to initiate sex?	She began to fellate me at 5am and said she wanted some. I couldn't at the time cuz I was way too tired so she went out on the patio for a dip in the tub instead.	Kiss on him, grab his cock, and tell him how badly you want it inside you. Not that hard tbh
You ever been super attracted to a girl that , not that many other guys also found attractive?	Perfectly curvy in the right places though fat. Lol BBW? Not grotesque morbid fat. Okay looking face wise does not wear makeup too often doesn't need it my opinion. Very effing cute. Describing some girls I've fallen for who work retail.	There's this girl I sometimes see around who I think is cute. It said to my friend she's underrated, and he got this look of disgust on his face and just turned back to looking at his phone, with no comment.
Do you ever get romantically interested in a woman after you find out that she likes you?	i would think it depends on the guy.... most guys: "she likes me, quick see how fast i can get sex" other guys: "try and get her number, i love never getting a call back" me: "ok, whos playing a joke"	Definitely. The way it normally works is I see dozens of decent looking women every day and don't usually give it a whole lot of thought -- I mean, approaching every good looking girl I encounter would be a little absurd, and unless I'm just looking to hook up, I have no reason to believe most would be a good match anyway. If she expresses interest though, she's no longer some random girl; she's a girl who's interested, so now there's a reason to really stop and take notice. Doesn't mean I'm going to be into her, but I'll at least consider it, which is a big step.
Why is your friend who is always complaining about being single single?	She relies on alcohol to get through every first date because she's so nervous and anxious that she needs to hide the real her. She's obsessed with finding a boyfriend but also fixates on relatively minor details as reasons why the current dude is incompatible. She has very little in the way of interests and hobbies--most of her free time is consumed by dating. She is deeply self-conscious and insecure in a manner which is neither cute nor endearing.	She's so afraid of not having a relationship work out, she'd rather avoid relationships entirely. A giant portion of her personality is that she's good at everything - great at her job, a loving sister and aunt, a tenacious fighter for justice, a reliable community volunteer - and having a relationship fail would ruin the image she has of herself. She never goes on dates, and in fact will actively avoid activities that might introduce her to other singles. Her life is full of love and friendship and family, but she's open about being jealous of her married friends.
During your childhood, how (if at all) did your parents discuss race and/or racism with you?	Not really. I was raised in a very mixed neighborhood, so I grew up playing with blond and black kids and seeing no difference.	My mother is very no-nonsense. Any time I mentioned I didn't like my hair or my skin color, she would basically tell me to cut that shit right out. "Your mom's black. Sorrynotsorry. You're never gonna look like Barbie. Self-acceptance is the best medicine." She'd also tell me and my brother that we were to be as non-threatening and as compliant as possible around cops. I remember her sitting us down and telling us not to fuck around if we ever got pulled over because they could kill us, especially my brother because he is male, autistic, and has Tourette's (so basically, the perfect storm of being read as a violent brown guy who comes off as aggressive due to uncontrollable tics and swearing, and also the inability to read situations as dangerous/serious).
For those over 21, who have a baby face and are petite, when did you feel like you started being treated like a "woman" instead of a girl because of how you look?	I’ve pretty much been treated like a woman since middle school, long before I was one, because I’m plus sized and very curvy. Being petite doesn’t seem to matter. EDIT: Thanks for downvoting my experiences assholes.	I'm almost 26 but without dressing up or wearing makeup, I pass as under 18. I was ID'd for a rated R movie on my 25th birthday. At work is the only place I feel like I don't get treated like a teen because I dress like a granny when I have to be in business casual.
How often do you take sick days just because you need a break?	I don't think I've taken a sick day in ~5 years. Even if i had a day where I didn't show up at my corporate job(I'm salaried, hours are irrelevant) I still did work, and I own a bar, co own a theatre and own multiple rental properties. I'll have days where I don't go many places, but I'm still always working. I'm pretty much too busy to even be sick, let alone "need a break"	I am a manager for a team of 28 and our performance review season just ended. Mental health days are absolutely a tolerated and understood thing at the company I work for and HR instructions for managers are to look out for them as an early sign of work related burnout. It works for now, but it's one of those things where it takes a small amount of abuse to spoil it for everyone and I dread that coming. As to myself, I think I take one about once every 3-4 months. A lot of the time, they are not really fully mental health days, but are combined. I'd feel under the weather for some reason, but not sick enough to call in sick by itself. Exhaustion and/or stress would make me decide to call in sick instead, when normally I'd just tough it out that day.
Just dumped my girlfriend for insulting me to another guy. Am I stupid?	She was drunk... People make mistakes. 2 years of your life wasted because you're overreacting on a mistake. At least hear her out.	You should provide some context for why she yelled at you and stormed out of the bar. For all we know, you could've been flirting with another girl at the bar and she caught you..
Is it okay to ask from your SO what porn he watches?	I think it is an invasion of privacy, but I also think more importantly that it is a question that is begging for a non-answer. Honestly, what good could possibly come out of answering this question honestly? No man would give you an unvarnished, brutally honest answer to, "So, what gets your rocks off in private when you need to bust a load before heading out to work?" Besides, many times what serves its purpose in private can be different to who we are attracted to in our dating lives.	Biggest question for you, do you really want to know what he likes to watch? So be careful what you might ask for, you can't unknow what he tells you.
At what point do I tell a girl that Im dating multiple people?	> Is it even neccesary? Yes since women will assume you are seeing them only. > At what point should I bring up that Im seeing seeing other people? This is tricky to answer since there is no right answer. Some day immediately, some say after you established a mutual attraction and gotten to know each other, some say after the first time you had sex. Ideally, as long as you do not intentionally mislead/lie about seeing her only: it is your call. Experiment with the timing for yourself since every situation is nuanced.	I see people saying on here to put it out immediately, I disagree. If you like her and want to date, cut everything else out and she never has to know. If you aren't serious about dating her put it out there after a first date and don't mention banging other people.
Are you aware of your threat level?	I'm 6'3", covered in tattoos, hit the gym 5 days a week and alway have a mean mug on because while I have a bomb ass house, it is located sufficiently in the ghetto. I would rather not know how people perceive me. Especially when I'm open carrying my handgun. My guess is most people look at me as threat level black watch plaid.	I'm a tall lanky dude with Harry Potter glasses and a jewfro. People probably assume that a strong breeze could take me in a fight.

Please report all rule breaking.	Mod note: locked due to rampant derailing, invalidation, and debating. Thank you to those who participated within the rules. Please report all rule breaking.
Why did you regret rejecting that girl?	I don't regret it. She turned out to be even crazier than initially thought. She went off the deep end. Got a bunch of tattoos. Constantly changing hair color and now has a kid. I dodged a crazy bullet.	She went on to date an abusive drunk who physically beat her. I never wanted to date her, but I wish her life had played out differently.
What fashion trend makes you cringe or laugh every time you see it?	Man bun. The droopy pants thing. That shit was never cool, and now it's beyond played out. You really got to have a certain look to get away with anything leopard print. Stretch pants can be too good or too bad. Be aware of what your ass looks like or else wear a long shirt with that get-up. Skinny jeans. Just stop. Oversized sunglasses with gold plating and monogram shit down the sides. Enormous fuckin' hoop earrings.	Camis/tanks layered over shirts. All I can think of is my awkward middle school days when that was the only way you could wear a tank because of the dress code.
What male burden, situation,or expectation are you glad you don't have to deal with?	Removed and nuked from orbit as we apparently can not discuss negative aspects of male socialization and culture without a metric ton of people getting offended and invalidating and derailing over it. This has made moderating the thread to our usual standards untenable. Edit: After discussion, top level responses have been reinstated for viewing. The thread will remain locked based on the reasons cited above.

Those of you who are allowed to take your pet to work: What do you do and did you find your job?	I work at a small software company, and we have a few people who bring their dogs in. I like dogs, so I very much enjoy having them around (except for the yippy, growly little chihuahua). However, I would never bring a dog in because I think it is inconsiderate in most cases. Unless you know that none of your coworkers are allergic or afraid of dogs, you shouldn't be bringing your dog to the office. It's a nice indulgence for you, but a real problem for these people.	I work as assistant in a management consultancy, so it's a very "business-y" place. When I had my interview I just asked if I could bring my dog (well behaved, small, trained) very once in a while. After a month I brought him for a day. The next day I came without him and everybody asked where he is and why he wasn't with me. So from the next day on he came to the office every day and everybody loves him. When we get clients here they are usually excited as he is pretty, well behaved and super friendly. He ignores people that don't want contact and stays close to the ones that pet or feed him. We had CEOs of very big companies here that shared food with him or brought dog treats. [Autumn suits him best] [with his best friend who works in online barketing]
How Do You Playfully Annoy Your SO?	She tells me deep, personal secrets about herself, and them I make fun of them. For example, my GF told me that she had a nose job as a kid after getting injured in an accident; I constantly tell her to be careful about her nose because she's got like a million dollars invested in it.	I tell him bedtime stories. I make them up on the spot and they are horrendous. He hates nothing more in the world than my bedtime stories. In his words "your stories sound like a 3 year old telling the details of a fever dream." But I insist on telling them nearly every night. I try and trick him by saying I actually prepared all day and made a plot, but it's a lie. These stories never have a point.
askwomen, Reddit always says don't stick your dick in crazy but they never talk about the opposite. Can you give examples of times that you have let crazy stick his dick in you? how did it change you?	I hate the phrase don't stick your dick in crazy. I find it full of gendered problematic language, reducing a woman that you had a problem with to one adjective, a though men do not have equal diagnosis of this disorder.	I've been with a few when I was younger. I learned to stop ignoring the red flags that come with an emotionally unstable partner. One resulted in a restraining order and another had me fleeing the state in the middle of the night- I was going to be moving anyway, but a particularly bad night prompted me to throw all my shit in the car and book it a week early. I'd really rather not go into details. Controlling and abusive behavior is no joke regardless of gender. If your partner is displaying the signs (unfounded jealousy, isolating you, tearing down your self esteem, ensuring control over your money, wild accusations) get out no matter how much you think you love them, or how fun they can be or if it's only when they're drunk. Your partner is supposed to enhance your life, not make it frightening and miserable.
Women with long term best friends, when you felt the friendship was on the way out, what were your behaviours?	I moved away for a year and she made no attempt to contact me at all. When I came back, I saw her once but by then, I realized I didn't really miss having her around. Plus, she's the kind who revolves her entire world around a boyfriend whenever she has one, which is tiring to deal with. I just stopped talking to her for the most part. She can find me if she wants to.	My boyfriend pointed out he had never met my best friend (since kindergarten) even though we'd been dating 1.5 years and she lives 15 minutes away. Her and I would text or talk daily, but never saw each other. I brushed it off because she was married with a kid. But 1.5 years and we live so close!? I finally wrote her a heartfelt email about it. She responded with a few sentences saying she didn't have time for this right now & I never heard from her again. It was the worst breakup I've ever gone through and I miss her so incredibly bad. A year or so later my mom ran into her and found out she was going through a divorce so I reached out to her with my condolences, she responded politely, but no communication since. :(
What's your wildest "Lady in the streets, crazy in the sheets" situation?	That doesn't tend to happen in my experience. It's usually either reserved in both situations or crazy in both situations.	She was a 21 year old virgin and grew up heavily Catholic. She wanted it bad, even got sexy outfits. I miss being with someone confident and has absolutely no worries about their body. It was the fire that I miss because now, I somehow attract very sweet yet insecure women. So the thought of having great sex is just a thought.
What kind of salary / year would you consider middle class? Upper middle class? Very well off?	I tend to think of it less in numbers and more in "how many paychecks are you from being unable to pay for your basic shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and needs?". In my very rough estimate: * Missing even one 2-week paycheck could leave you without basic needs or even homeless? Poverty to Working Poor * Missing 2 to 3 paychecks will leave you with no options and no savings? Working Poor to Lower Middle Class * Missing 4 to 6 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Lower Middle Class * Missing 7 to 12 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Middle Class * Missing 13 to 16 paychecks will leave you with nothing? Upper Middle Class * Able to survive an entire year from savings without any difficulty? Well off. * Able to survive for multiple years from savings without any difficulty? Rich.	I live in Argentina, so a salary of about $1200-$1500 for a family of 3 or 4 is middle-class. My SO earns a bit less than $1000, and I earn the rest, and we'd do perfectly fine except for my medical bills. $1500-$3500 is upper-middle class. More than $3500 or $4000 is "holy fuck you must be a politician why are you making so much money". Edit: these figures are per month, we don't calculate salaries per year.
What are the most destructive ideals we teach girls?	ITT: no real ideals mentioned, just angry men projecting. No girl is taught to be passive and virtuous. She's just not attracted to you. A "man hater" feminist is just a girl who's not attracted to your xenophobic, insulated, backward, Midwestern ways. Also: parents do not teach their little girls "the lie that women earn 70% of what men earn for the same job".	I think the most destructive thing we teach girls is that to be passive is virtuous. To wait for the man. To be a follower, not a leader. It breeds weakness and entitlement both. Edit: Thanks for the gold, gracious stranger. :)
Ladies, What is the grossest thing you've ever done for your SO?	Cleaned up his puke (which there was a LOT of) when he got sick from drinking too much one night during a Vegas trip.	OK. So, this is really awful. Back when we first started dating, we spent the night at a friend's house and picked up crabs from the blankets they'd let us borrow. We both used the treatments to get rid of them. It worked pretty quickly for me, but my SO is pretty hairy and the little buggers just didn't want to vacate the premises. They were everywhere...even on his legs and under his arms! I spent hours with tweezers plucking the little bastards off of him and killing them. It was quite the bonding experience although it's also one of those things about which we no longer speak.
Did you ever start at friends or bestfriends before you started dating?	As a man who is 5'5", I *only* can date people who have gotten to know me. I generally don't like going to bars and clubs to meet people because my tall friends have it so easy meeting people and I'm treated with an uncomfortable amount of disregard. Life on hard mode	We were coworkers that grew to be best friends. We kept each other securely in the friend zone for about 3 years. 2.5 years after dating officially we got married. I always used our relationship as an example of why relationships work out better when the couple was friends first. We never really fought. We had disagreements but we always worked them out calmly. Our similar viewpoints and desires for the future made it easy to combine efforts to reach our goals. We truly enjoyed each others company. We divorced after 11 years of marriage because she was having an affair with her best friend's boyfriend.
What’s the saddest story your parents ever told you about their lives?	Not my parents, but my mom's mother. My grandma (we call her Bachan as a reference to the Japanese word for grandmother) experienced two miscarriages before she had my uncle, and then eventually my mom.	My parents immigrated to Canada from south east Asia with three young kids and about $100 in their pocket having lost everything they had due to war. With a language barrier and no marketable skills, they took low paying jobs just to get by. My dad had found a job working in the kitchen of donut shop. He was promised something like $4 per hour but when his first paycheck came, he found out they had cheated him so he quit on the spot. He spend the next days going around the city looking for another job. One day, my mother was on her way home from her seamstress job and bumped into him on the city bus. He was crying because he couldn’t find a job. Thinking of my strong, stoic dad publicly crying out of desperation will always get me.
What’s up with the difference in density in woman with boobs of the same size?	So why are women's breasts harder than others? Donno, I was just always glad they showed them to me. % fat, I suppose? Muscle is more dense than fat so maybe if a woman's overall body fat is higher, she has softer breasts?	I believe what the lad is trying to say is: why is it even among women with similar breast size they will still feel totally different. Like a bag of sand right? :P
Ladies who checkout r/askmen. How do you feel about most of the posts about guys being insecure?	It validated what I learned far too late in life and helped me treat the men in my life with more care. I honestly didn't really know anything about the "fragile male ego" until almost my 30s and instead held onto this concept of the John Wayne type of man. (Perhaps influenced by a father who loves me deeply but in that John Wayne type of way.) So I am thankful for the insight, because it has inspired me to take better care of the men in my life, to offer non-judgmental space, to compliment them often and sincerely and to be a better friend. So I am grateful.	It's kind of refreshing to see that everyone has insecurities. I was really close to my brother growing up so my perception of men didn't change too much; I already knew they have insecurities just like everyone else.
Slept on the couch last night because I suggested to the wife that we try formula for our baby. Men of Reddit, what's some other 'doghouse' stories for no reason?	Cold shoulder the bitch until she gets the point that reacting that way on her emotions isn't appropriate. Unfortunately, you're really fucked over here either way you go about things. If she decides to keep abusing you, you'll be ostracized and told to "man-up" when you try and contact the police. If you defend yourself, you'll be arrested and jailed. If you divorce her, you'll never see your child again and you'll pay a monthly stipend for that "privilege." Good luck, dude. I have no advice, because there's no advice to give. All you can do is hope she un-fucks her mind and returns to sanity. Also, retreat to the couch every night this week. Maybe she'll get the point.	I don't have anything to add about the OP and his situation, but I will say that I never understood the "send your man to the couch" mentality. The few times I've been immature enough to do something like this, I just go to the couch myself. I am the one who wants separation for whatever reason, so I just leave and sleep there. Shit, the bed is shared and I have no more claim over it than he does.
After good sex do you guys keep thinking about it the next day?	I can and do still think about the few times in my life when women have said nice things to me. I wonder if I'd think about anything else ever again if sex ever happened.	If by the next day, you mean the next 50 years, then yes. Good sex goes straight to my mental spank bank, where it will be stored until I die or get dementia.
Women who have SUPER heavy periods, How do you deal with it?	I dealt with it by balancing my hormones and no longer have this issue. It’s not normal for periods to be super heavy and painful—although I thought that it was for years. If it is really bothering you, visit a naturopath that can help you get some balance.	I sleep with towels under me, and one between my legs. Gross as fuck, but sometimes I sit on the toilet for 10-15 minutes pushing like I'm having a baby in an effort to get as much out as I can. I wear ultra and super plus tampons for the majority of my period, and I have to change them every 30/45 minutes for the first three days. My periods last 7+ days every time. It fucking sucks, it's real gross, I can't sleep because I'm up every hour on the hour cleaning up what looks like a murder scene in the bathroom. Cups, pads, and anything under a super sized tampon basically laugh at me when I use them. I frequently beg my boyfriend to perform a backyard hysterectomy.
Where are some safe places for women to travel alone to?	I am a female solo traveler who has been to 45 countries including Mexico, Marrocco, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, South Africa, Turkey, and Myanmar. If you learn about the culture and how people behave and dress and what's appropriate and what is not, you can travel anywhere.	Copenhagen, Denmark was great for me. It’s a very safe country, everyone speaks English, and I often walked home from the clubs at 3 or 4 am by myself and felt completely safe.
So in what ways did you win the genetic lottery?	I'm white. This gives me the privilege to go through life never facing any challenges at all because of my race, and it's pretty great. I work to fight my own internalized racism, I call it out in others, and I know very well that the color of my skin is a win of a genetic lottery.	I’m just super healthy and resilient. I’ve never been seriously ill, rarely catch viruses off the people around me, and when I do I fight them off very quickly. I’ve accidentally eaten expired food a bunch of times and been fine, I eat like crap and my stomach never hurts, and I have no allergies. The last time I threw up was maybe 15 years ago, and I haven’t gotten even a mild cold for 3 years. Whenever I feel down over something else genetics screwed me over with, like our family’s giant nose we all inherit, I remember and feel grateful that I have the constitution of a buffalo.
For the first time in over a decade my weight this morning was under 230 pounds, what are you feeling good about today?	Congrats on your weight loss. If you'd like to lose more quickly a water only fast did wonders for me.	Didn't really know what to do in my 30 minute break, so I just went to the nearby park and laid down in the sun. That was just nice and very relaxing.
What's the best way to approach family boning?	Everyone who replied to this post with “Roll Tide” is getting banned E: The count is currently ~~14 15 16 18 20 23 25~~ 51 A hearty "Fuck Auburn" will forgive this transgression	Everyone who replied to this post with “Roll Tide” is getting banned E: The count is currently ~~14 15 16 18 20 23 25~~ 51 A hearty "Fuck Auburn" will forgive this transgression
People who have been married 10+ years, how did your love change with you SO?	Before you make any decisions about marriage, /r/marriagestrike and /r/TheRedPill Take a look at /r/relationships, /r/breakups, /r/mensrightslinks and see if you're willing to take that risk. My suggestion to you is to remain single until you can't get any more hot chicks. Then get married to the best one you can get. If you eventually do get married, get a prenup and make sure she makes exactly the same income as you. Don't sacrifice yourself.	We've been together 12 years and we're 30's - 40's. It changes over time. We kind of have a relationship like your folks now and that's OK. We also have two kids under 4yo which has changed us yet again. Now we are facing the challenge of raising a family together. Frankly there isn't much time (or want) for gazing into each others eyes anymore. Sex is stale and infrequent for the most part. We are stressed and tired so the little things that used to bother us about each other flare up again and become little fights. But we're doing it, we're a team with the same focused goals. We support each other and protect each other.
Guys who have their stuff together, but won't commit, what's your story?	jfc you people are cancer. locked. Edit because some of you have reached out requesting constant assurances that you are not cancer: this got brigaded by mgtow and incel garbage. Edit because some of the mgtow and incel garbage have reached out calling me names: it's a beautiful day, why don't you go out and enjoy some of this planets natural splendor?	jfc you people are cancer. locked.

Ladies of reddit: what's your side hustle?	Because I'm shy, people are shocked to also find out that I'm hilarious and have a great sense of humor. Apparently the two can't be mixed.	I'm a personal assistant for temporary hire- basically I'm a detail-oriented bitchwork assistant. People can hire me to do their groceries, run errands, fold their laundry, walk their dogs, scan/file papers, upload their items to ebay or amazon for selling. I'm a trustworthy multi-tool for people who don't have family members that can be slaves for them. Great for small business owners and single parents! People can hire me once or seasonally.
What's an old trend you refuse to drop despite it being "out of fashion"?	When I was in high school and before most girls realised that trends are shit and classic dress always wins out in the end: Dressing nicely and taking pride in appearance. I will almost always choose to wear a nice collared shirt, with a pair of nice dark jeans/nice pants, and suitable footwear while also making sure my hair is in a classic good looking style kept short and brushed over to one side. Apparently though a nice woolblend pullover that matches a collared shirt well makes you look gay...good thing I'm not after teenage girls.	Professional wrestling. It had broad mainstream appeal in the late 90's but it's popularity has been declining for a decade. Despite being 27, living with a long term SO and having a career in fashion, I still love the theatrics, athleticism and over the top story telling as much as I did as a kid.
To make it clear for some people, what is a relationship NOT about?	Apparently, it's not about having someone to take you to the ER in the middle of the night or who can can inspect your back for bruises, marks, etc. Wonder what the heck they are for then!	Well, a *loving and supportive* relationship isn't about winning rounds of "which of us is right" and storing up ammunition from past wrongs to use against them in said bouts.
I told my guy friends I hadn't been on a date in 6 years and got a lot of sympathy looks and sighs for it. What is something you've shared with your friends thinking it wasn't a big deal, but they reacted poorly?	How is not going on a date in 6 yrs not a big deal? Unless....you dont want to go on dates	Told some housemates in casual conversation that I'm introverted. Wow, they did not take that well and spent forever insisting that I wasn't. It ended up leading to genuine conflict. It was weird.
Who was the one girl that almost drove you over the edge of sanity?	I was under the impression OP meant sexually or via seduction. You know, the someone that gets your engine revving, the one that knows how to flip the sexual switch but either doesn't or can't go all the way or gives you that mind-blowing orgasm. I guess I was wrong?	Well, I'll say something else form the rest. My mother, she shouted for no reason. Oh you left a wrapper on the table? That'll be a 30 minute lecture on why you are a useless piece of shit...just like your father. I mean, it's easier to just do it yourself or remind me about it. And now imagine 18 years of this. There were many occasions where I almost snapped and shouted back and i hate rising my voice.
what's extremely trendy where you live right now?	LaLaRue leggings in hideous patterns on extra - large women. This company is doing no one any favors, and it seriously bothers me.	Crazy loaded milkshakes. Like, a milkshake topped with a donut, a rasher of maple bacon, whipped cream and froot loops, that kind of thing. They look artistically pleasing but impossible to eat (/drink) and the thought of the energy content is enough to make them unappealing!
Should men be entitled to a "legal" abortion?	I agree with OP. Men should be able to sign a document absolving themselves from financial obligation. It's not fair that they could get stuck with a child they didn't want in the first place. If the mom wants to keep the baby, good for her, but she better be willing to pay for the kid on her own.	Men ARE allowed to sign documents absolving themselves of (at least financial) responsibility, though the woman in question needs to be on board. This is a thing that happens. But what's really at the heart of this: it's not fair because biology's not fair.
How do you guys deal with thoughts about missed opportunities?	Everyone handles it differently. For me I'll still get a pang if regret whenever my mind wanders over trivial crap that happened 15 years ago. In the end you just have to learn from it. Do better next time and deal with the emotions of regret it guilt as it comes to you.	That stuff happens when I'm on long drives and for some reason my mind wanders. Not sure why. As far as dealing with it, the past is the past. It's not like it's the end of the world you missed an opportunity with a girl, you're in high school. You'll have wayyy more chances with wayyy more girls. And if you see this girl at school just walk up and apologize for being an idiot, and ask her to see a movie or something.
How do I teach my daughter to respect herself?	> is targeted towards attracting boys and not what she wants to wear just to feel good. What if successfully attracting boys makes her feel good?	Don't tell her "oh some boys like small butts" or anything like that, whatever you do. Help her find other ways to feel good about herself. Help her find things she's good at and praise her for them. Make a point of that, giving her positive reinforcement for what she does, not how she looks, because girls get too much of one and not enough of the other and it can really fuck with their self-image.
What is your infamous "but I meant it as a compliment" moment?	I told my fiancee... "Don't take this the wrong way but I find you stunningly attractive... and it's your worst quality" She's funny, engaging, genius, etc :) She took it the right way!	Wanted to compliment how perfect and clear the skin of a girl I was seeing was. Said "You look like you wear a lot of makeup."
To those who were bullied, how did it affect you?	Mmmm, I was bullied and also did the bullying. I think both were useful experiences. It's possible it helped me get to a point where no one bullies me (or can) and I don't really want to bully anyone either	I still have trouble believing that people mean it when they say anything positive about me at all. Compliments sound like lies to me.
What unique features attract you?	LOL..for some reason, my gf really digs old people and since Im 9 years older than her that puts me in the category. What I meant to say is, she dislikes childish things and tend to gravitate towards people with maturity. Even though I am older than her but I am super into cutesy things. Ok back to the post, I am attracted to woman with nice muscly calves or she is taller than me. I am 178 cm, so if you are taller and slightly athletic like them volleyball girls. Hmm...apply within. I like redheads with freckles, I think they are really appealing.	Women with large upper incisors. There's something predatory about it that appeals, I think. I just find them hella hot Edit: apologies everyone, I was mistaken. The incisors are the front teeth, the teeth to which I was trying to refer are the canines ☺️
What type of guy is definitely not your type?	Off the top of my head--guys who... * smoke *anything* (so, doing drugs is also a big no) * are into men's rights bullshit/not feminists * are racist/sexist/homophobic, etc. * are obsessed with anime/manga/Cosplay/hentai/Japan * have an Asian fetish (ew, ew, EW) * are super religious * fit into the mold of a stereotypical "manly man" * are very politically conservative. I think I could *maybe* be alright with someone who is fiscally conservative, but NEVER someone who is socially conservative, blech * smell funky/bad Edit: Lmfao, some of you seem to think I hate Asians.... I hate people who FETISHIZE Asians, big fucking difference.	'Lad' types. I think it's the UK equivalent of 'bros' basically. Just lots of rude, loud behaviour disguised as 'banter' and lots of unfunny, often misogynist jokes.
What are things that if a person likes or dislikes them, you think it says a lot about their personality?	If they say they like Trump or any other member of the Republican Party, I will know right away that they are a person that doesn’t care about other human beings.	If a person likes to spends more time, energy and detail complaining about all the things they hate than talking about things they actually enjoy, they are usually draining to be around.
Men, do you feel like working in an all-women environment is more difficult than the other way around?	I've read this hentai. Men in female environment leads to harem, female in male environment leads to either rape, happy marriage, or some combination of the two.	"walking on eggshells" is the correct phrase. i work with mostly women in my office, and i have to be careful that i don't offend my female peers. i can say anything around the guys, though. we know that we aren't going to throw a fit and go to HR because our little feelings were hurt. you have to constantly censor yourself and be extremely careful about giving criticism when working with women because they are more than likely to take criticism or a difference of opinion as a personal attack or discrimination. that's the biggest difference between working with men and women - women take a lot of irrelevant, benign, impersonal stuff as an insult or sexism/discrimination. you don't have to do that with men. nuff said.
When I was young I was always told I was annoying because I talked too much. Now I can't hold a conversation more than 2 minutes because of the anxiety of talking too much and being annoying. How can I be talkative again without being annoying?	You don't want to be, trust me. I have been extremely talkative my whole life; chatting has always been an utter joy to me, but it wasn't shared by the people I'm chatting with. They always seemed uninterested in what I had to say, always just giving me random noises periodically, maybe a monossylabic word if I was lucky. The truth is, people don't CARE about what other people have to say. It's something I've been growing more and more aware of as time has passed. Nowadays, I'm 28yo,and I basically don't talk to anyone. Everything I know, all the things I learn that I think are cool, all the trivia I come across, stay locked away inside my head, and honestly? It has made me less and less interested in learning new things.	Japan had an interesting illustration about communication as a game of catch. The ball should be going back and forth with the same power and speed. You can't only throw the ball, you have to catch it too.
[NSFW] What is a dead give-away that a woman watches too much porn when she's in bed with you?	“Squirting” I grew up with sisters who used to clown on guys they dated who begged them to essentially pee on them	Ironically it's the same thing some of the women complained guys did on them - thinking the guy should do his best jackhammer impersonation
What was the most uncomfortable event during a family gathering you witnessed?	I've seen lies about me happen, and also when my (now divorced) cousin grumbled about christmas cards being for christians n god is bad etc to my (mentally ill) uncle..... nan requested the cards back. No money was in the cards.	I have a couple good ones: 1. My brother brought a stripper he was dating to our family dinner at my grandma's house. She had a panic attack at the table and ran out of the house, yelling "you're all just too normal for me!" 2. At my wedding, my aunt and uncle made the decision to get divorced. They then hit the dance floor and had their "last dance as a couple," complete with crying and sad kisses.
Do you think most men are physically unattractive?	TIL: Most women find personality much more attractive than physical looks. I can finally eat that extra piece of cake!! ahha	I think most men are just kind of neutral. They aren't gross to look at but they aren't what I consider hot either. And that's more of a personal preference thing. My baseline for attraction with men I don't know is neutral, and many will become attractive once I get to know them. It's very rare that I'll see a man I don't know and instantly think he's attractive. It happens, but not often. Edit: I do think the majority of men I see out in the world could stand to put a little more effort into their appearances. Wear clothes that fit, for example. It does wonders.
What's your secret weapon to ending a fight or argument with your SO?	Obligatory not a man but a woman, I think that when people have good emotional maturity, becoming pissed off isn't a thing that happens. I don't feel like arguments should have to be ended because they should never begin in the first place Good communication gives way to discussions, not arguments. Especially very very tough discussions, you never want those to be arguments because that's how things end.	Keeping on topic. Don't argue to win. If they change the subject just straight up ask what it has to do with X and just rewind the conversation. It annoys my wife but at that point she's annoyed anyway and we actually resolve stuff.
What’s a good thing about yourself you keep secret, and why?	I can read people, like, the little things when in a conversation, those are the ones that matter. It's one of the personality traits of the entrepreneur ESTP-A / ESTP-T. Sensing in a conversation. So, I'm very open, I can talk very easily, to anyone. And for example my teammates know about this. However, my ability to be sensing in a conversation, I like keeping that to myself.	I'm faster at work than I let on. I keep that secret because hard workers only get worked harder and I don't feed my kids with "At a boys"
Women with long-term and/or chronic mental health issues: how do you deal with life and the struggle of accepting life?	It’s hard girl,but pray, I’ve prayed asked God for guidance and prepare my path, all the time. Don’t over think your situations. You got this	It was a lot easier before the pandemic. I really don’t see the point most days but the bills must be paid.
Men of Reddit, if you could choose, how would you prefer a girl you are friends with to approach coming out of the "friendzone"?	She has to broach the subject first. First rule of friend-zone is the man never *escapes* from it, he is *released* by the warden. He doesn't get to decide whether to be in the friendzone or not. His only decision is yes/no if the woman decides so be something more.	for the girl to be blunt and honest, it's the best way in my opinion, when people bounce around the subject it's easy to get confused so it's just a lot easier to be blunt and straight to the point.
What are some red flags women should look for in men?	That guy is probably just trying to make up for his lack of looks? Maybe he's worked hard at getting a decent career, and has probably been told his whole life that it will help him get women (which is definitely a lie). There's probably nothing wrong with him really, harmless but frustrated and lonely. Ok, maybe not the best social skills. Speaking as a man I'd say superficial charm should actually be your biggest red flag, because that's highly indicative of a psychopath. The guys with poor social skills are harmless, they just need told what not to say.	1. Failure to take 'no' for an answer. 2. 'Loan sharking'; holds favors over your head or implies that you 'owe' him. 3. A lack of consistency between word and deed. 4. Speaks extremely poorly of others or treats other poorly. 5. Everyone in his past seems to be either crazy or an asshole.
What are subtle red flags at a job interview that verbalize, "Working here would suck"?	Show up when people are arrive for work if you can. Look at the faces of the people as they are walking into work. If most of them look unhappy chances are you'll be unhappy there also.	I interviewed at a place that said more than 5 call outs in a year meant termination and that I shouldn't expect to take any vacation days in the first year. I'd say that sounds pretty shitty. Also find out why they need you to work there. What happened to the last guy? Is there high turnover? If you can lowkey talk to anyone that works there, do it. They'll tell you what's up.
Women in male-dominated, casual working environments, what are your summer work outfits?	Stuff I wear to work: Button up shirts, you can find short sleeved or three quarter sleeved ones. Suit separate bottoms, including pants and knee length skirts Formal looking dresses at least knee length. If it’s sleeveless, I wear a cardigan. As for shoes, I stick to flats, oxfords, and occasionally strappy sandals if it goes with the outfit. Depending on your co workers, you might get a lot of attention on what you’re wearing. I’ve had male co workers complement me on my dress, and I’ve been reported to the manager for wearing a short sleeve t shirt to work (granted it was a back stabby office environment.) It isn’t fair and men don’t have to deal with this, but err on the side of formality and conservative when you dress.	I'm a programmer. We can't wear shorts at my job, so I usually wear pants inside(the A/C is intense so it is rather cold) but shorts when I leave. I also wear dresses. I am rather conservative so I wear girly things but you see no cleavage.
How do you reconnect with friends after you've isolated yourself due to depression/anxiety?	fuck them... if they didn't care that I stopped contacting them they are not my friends anymore people just care about themselves or someone they can fuck	Start reaching out to them in a low key way and invite them to something concrete. Send them a message like "Hey I know I've been distant lately but I'd really like to catch up, do you want to go grab a drink at the pub/coffee at x cafe/food at x place?". Don't expect too much, some people may not want to reconnect, but I suspect if they were actually your friend before they will.
Why do you think it is it mostly guys wanting to be rated?	Because any woman who is a 3-4+ is constantly showered with attention and compliments on social media and in real life. Why would she have to post to a sub like that? She already thinks she's a 10.	Because men are consistently not given any indication of their attractiveness in the real world (compliments from women, women approaching men for dates, etc.).
What Is Something That You Could Not Understand, Or Relate To Until It Happened To You?	Literally everything. Being a parent, breaking a bone, jumping out of a plane... You can't really understand anything until it happens to you. So its kinda bothersome to me that people think that any one experience is, by nature, more transformative than any other Being nitpicky aside, I'd say getting my master's. Feelsgoodman. jpg	How constricting anxiety and depression can be. And how they can turn you into a hollow shell of yourself that doesn't leave bed.
What is the absolutely stupidest and incorrect thing/comment you have ever seen upvoted on reddit?	I might get downvoted for this, but I see a lot of fatlogic on /r/askwomen If you are okay with being fat, that's fine. But it's not healthy, and it's not an irreversible condition. Nobody is genetically fat, it frustrates me when I see people say there is nothing they can do and spout wildly incorrect information about nutrition and health and weight loss.	Someone asserted that Native Americans don't exist. Basically, my friend ID'd herself as Native American in the OG comment, and someone ranted at her that saying you're Native American is like saying you have Neanderthal DNA and that she was an idiot for believing that she was a made up race, and then called her an SJW/special snowflake. She still laughs hysterically when she brings this up and it happened like 2 years ago on AskReddit.
What's it like having a healthy relationship with food?	I don't know that that is healthier than... I honestly don't know what the flipside of this would be, without falling into fatphobic rhetoric. Calories comprise one of the literal things we need to live. We are an intensely social species. Ergo, food is more than energy, although that is important too. It's community and art and all things that contribute to our health that aren't about an arbitrary beauty standard and/or trend.	Growing up in PA and then living in LA for a long time, I was introduced to this foreign concept that eating healthy means you *feel* better. I had always been around this narrative that it’s all about how you look, and not necessarily a tool for well-being and mental health. That changed everything for me. Edit: LA= Los Angeles
What movie is amazing in the first half and a complete disappointment in the second?	Star Wars The Force Awakens seemed decent and cool for the first like 45 minutes, and then it went to shit really fast with cliches and boring story telling.	Mine is Cameron's Avatar. Spoilers, obviously. If you cut the movie right when the humans burn down the giant sacred tree, it's fucking amazing. It's a moving tale of a fascinating species fighting against invaders, a reminder of what mankind usually is, a good love story and a visual masterpiece. However, the movie doesn't stop there, and adds a godawful hour of cliche fights where the good guys win against all odds, outnumbered with worse means, by sheer plot armor. And obviously a happy ending that's literally been seen a million times before. It's such a shame. The powerful and moving message of the movie is toned down in order to make it more commercially appealing.
What's the worst decision you ever made that, despite all odds, turned out wonderfully?	While this is a very very bad thing to do, I am frequently skeptical about "doctor's orders", and it usually works. My doctor would tell me not to touch my sprained foot, I would pull it so hard that something cracks and I'm mobile again. My doctor would tell me to not touch my ear during the infection, I manage to "clear the path" for medication to enter my ear by touching all around it.	Turned up for a job interview in a tracksuit. It was for a job as a sports teacher, so I thought it would be appropriate... until I saw that every single one of the other 12 applicants were wearing a full suit. Well, I must've done something right, because they offered me the job on the spot! When I later asked about the interview, they said I seemed to be much more laid back than the other applicants and thought I'd fit well into the department.
Non-Americans, what do you not understand about the United States of America?	Why the democrats keep using the language of the republicans in debates. Also, how is [Nancy Pelosi still saying that Trump shouldn't be impeached](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/05/pelosi-trump-impeach-house-democrats-244567)? Also, why aren't Americans ashamed of their continuous "regime change" fucking over the rest of the world and instead trumpt their own greatness? Do you even know how many wars and suffering you're directly involved in right now?	Plastic (bags) in abundance. I saw people demanding a plastic bag for one bottle of water. Where I live, you have to pay for bags therefore people bring their own bags, backpacks etc.
What's something you never want to know about your gf/wife?	Anybody saying sexual history is either insecure, jealous, hypocritical or a mixture of the the three. Home girl got some. So did you (probably). Why be squeamish about it? Chances are, if she did it a lot, she's probably pretty fucking good at it by now. As long as people are safe, don't judge and don't get grossed out. She's taking your dick now so be fuckin' grateful. Grow the fuck up. /rant EDIT: a comma	What she looks like dead. If it weren't so selfish and horrid a thing to say, then I'd hope I kick the bucket before her.
Two people. Both from different subreddits. You set up the date. Which subreddits are they from? How will the interaction go down?	/Theredpill and /srswomen I'd bring a hidden camera crew to follow them around and watch them as they try to survive a monster/zombie/outbreak type situation. It's one hour, 10 weeks. If they fall in love and stop being total skumps they win some $. They get married, it has its own reality show. Then they start slipping back into their old ways and when they split he gets some weird show about PUAs and she gets some show about the far left that's basically the left equivalent of those televangelists.	IRL, /r/curlyhair met /r/beards at at meetup arranged by a local subreddit. Two and a half years later, it's still going well. I'd like to see /r/whatsthisbug set up with /r/whatsthisplant. They'd have amazing nature walks.
Why is the romance novel genre so negatively stigmatized?	Partially due to to misogyny because they are associated with women and partially due to the common perception of them as erotic fiction/porn. I personally don't enjoy those kinds of books, but I see nothing wrong with those who do.	Start being open about it, that's really the only way to destigmatize the genre - plus - when you start being honest about it, you'll quickly find how not alone you are. Every time I do, people either go "me too!" or are actually really curious to find our more. It's really great. And you should absolutely do a podcast with your husband about the ones you read. Hopefully, his reaction will be in the same vein as [Paul Scheers](https://www.google.se/amp/s/ew.com/books/2018/01/15/paul-scheer-hockey-romance-novel-victoria-denault-score/amp/).
Women who made a career change/went back to school in their 30s, what do you do?	I became a commercial pilot. I had hit a plateau in my previous career at 32, and after a divorce, just took a hard look at my personal happiness. I started the transition about 2.5 years ago while still working my other job, and made the leap to being paid to fly about a year ago. I love it.	I tried out a lot of things in my 20s, none of them stuck and I felt miserable. Turned 30, went fuck it because life is too short, went back to uni to do something creative because I'd always been a creative person. Life became much happier - and I'm now doing a PhD in music!
How often do you wash your hair?	Every 2-3 days. I have long and thick hair so it's a hassle to wash everyday. It starts feeling gross like there's something crawling on my head if I leave it unwashed longer than that.	Day One: Clean Hair Day Two: Dry Shampoo (worn down) Day Three: Dry Shampoo (worn up in bun) Day Four: Shower or super dirty bun Day Five: plz shower
What do you think about the "ask out as many girls as possible" strategy?	I know you are asking men, and I'm not one, but dear god don't do this. Don't use every woman you meet to boost your self esteem. Don't make her figure out how to say no to your overstepping without setting off this guy she hardly knows. Don't be that guy.	I kind of agree with your friends reasoning. I know it helped me get rid of my nerves. When hanging out at a bar, I use to tell my friends "who wants to watch me get rejected?" then go walk up on a group of girls. Most times I struck out but it worked on occasions. It lead to some great nights. It never ruined a night. So I call it a winning strategy.
Men who financially support their partner: how do you truly feel about it? Has it changed the dynamic of your relationship at all?	I might be oldschool but I feel happy when I support my girl financially. It's not like she is profiting from me but I as the man feel sorta responsible for her. When we go out, she pays sometimes as well. It's just a manly thing to do, same as paying on the first date. &#x200B; &#x200B; Please radical feminists don't attack me because I said that I feel responsible for women.	It does not make me feel any different. My wife chose to stay home with our autistic daughter. Actually, truth be told, I am glad that she did. My wife is the single most important part of making sure our daughter get's the education & support she needs to become successful, which she really has. In the past year she has developed socially much better than anyone had anticipated. That's primarily because of my wife
Females, how important is the bottom 1/2 centimetre of a man's left earlobe to you when dating?	What the fuck did I just stumble into? Man the 9th page of /r/all gets weird. I really should get ready for work.....	I love pointing out men with bad earlobes in public, and then laughing at them with my girlfriends because they're such creeps and they'd never, ever stand a chance with us. And when I do spot a man with a good earlobe, I like to surreptitiously reverse-pickpocket my hair bands into his pockets to mark my territory so other females know to keep their distance.
What's the worst date you've ever been on?	Grabbed coffee and she was really weird She asked if I wanted to grab dinner; I said I was busy. Then we left our separate ways	Was walking down the street and the guy pointed to a specific set of stairs and said, “This was where I proposed to (my ex)”. Needless to say he was NOT over her and things didn’t work out.
Black women of Reddit, what should a white woman who is raising a black child know?	I'm not black or white (or a woman for that matter) but I'd imagine you'd have to give the black child the "talk" about police interactions.	Make sure you have diverse friends. Don't let your black kid be the only diversity in your entire world because then the child only sees a sea of sameness and is always a defacto outcast. You be the defacto outcast! Go to all black areas for dinner, have black friends, let the kid see that blackness is normal and not aberrant. Representation matters... watch black tv shows, visit black friends, go to areas that might have more black people and enjoy! At the very least you'll understand on a small scale how it feels to constantly be the one who stands out in the crowd.
How has a girl creeped you out?	Coming on too strong. I hate to admit this because usually I swear I like when girls take initiative but when they start locking down a relationship, it kind of creeps me out. Maybe its the commitment that creeps me out?	Some lady at the beach started telling my daughter the dangers of talking to strangers. I had to inform her that right now _she_ was *the stranger*.
What is an aspect of (traditional) masculinity that you think more women should work to embrace/adopt/integrate?	Financial independence. It's nice to have people pay for you every once in a while, but I wish some women would think about the situation instead of accepting every free drink offered. Is it really worth saving $5? I could go even deeper into financial independence from parents and boyfriend/husbands, but I'm on mobile right now.	Assertiveness. So many women I interact with professionally will downplay their opinions and stances. They'll use softer language as if they're timid or trying not to step on toes. I'm guilty of this myself and have to work to use stronger, confident language when I need to.
What is something men do thinking it will impress women but ends up backfiring badly?	Refusing to comment on a girls appearance, even when she asks for it, because he's scared that he'll be seen as shallow and objectify her. Yeah, it's not all that matters, but damn, boy, if I ask if this top is appropriate for dinner, I want a proper answer!! Don't say yes to everything I suggest! What's also bad is the opposite, when they're too honest, and pick apart everything and whittle away every shred of self esteem the girl has. Haven't met a guy like that, (thankfully) but the first one I have.	Making fun of other men, or questioning the masculinity of other men in an insulting way. It's not attractive at all.
Can I see pictures of your pets, please?	Users are reminded that by sharing a picture with the community, they potentially lose all control over what happens to that picture and what other users do in response to that picture. In the past, we have had issues with: * Stalking/Harassment * A user writing a script to scrape the thread and attach pictures to user names at a later date * Doxxing * Unwelcome private messages Post at your own risk! No life guards in the pool!

Men who avoided getting into relationships, how long did you try to stay single and what was the reason why?	simple: guys avoid relationships when they don't have feelings for someone. if a guy has strong feelings for someone, likely he won't avoid the relationship. guys usually want sex, and will have sex with someone they're not emotionally into. and usually don't want a relationship with someone they're not really into. sometimes we'll end up in a relationship that starts out as sex. but feelings never really develop. then it's just a matter of time before the breakup.	20-24 I stayed out of them because my girlfriend cheated on me. I had huge trust issues after it. A girl gave me her phone number one day, I thought she was the greatest thing in the world for 6.5 years till this past February when she broke off our engagement to “be alone” ..with her gym buddy.
What was the best piece of advice you have ever received? Who was it from?	I was at work when I found out that a really good friend of mine was killed in a car accident in the early hours of that morning. I excused myself into a private room where a coworker saw me crying and asked what was wrong. After I told her she said "Don't let people see you crying, it shows you're weak".......	I was married to an abusive man and I wanted to leave but was scared. I think I had battered wife syndrome or something. My aunt knew what was going on and asked me "If your daughter were in the same situation what would you tell her? That's what you need to do." It was about 2-3 weeks later, I packed what I could fit into my car and never saw him again. I've given the same advice to other women because it's what saved me and is probably the reason I'm still alive.
What's a opinion about love, dating or just being a guy you want to share...but don't want to devote a topic to?	For a long time I had weird anxiety about the idea that if my girlfriend were to leave me I'd be stuck dating desperate late 20s/early 30s women who didn't settle down when they were younger. And then I realized I can just date women in their early 20s forever. A weight lifted from my shoulders.	I'm uncomfortable with expressing emotion and I don't know how to get passed it. Honestly, my dog died and I had to dwell on it and "force" myself to cry. Kinda weird, right ?
How am I supposed to reply to "Yeah," "😂😂😂," and other texts that don't really push the conversation forward?	As a girl, I'll just give my personal advice. Don't. Just don't reply. When I respond to a message with a generic such as an emoji or an Lol, it means the conversation has come to and end. Sometimes guys will desperately attempt to carry on and it's aggravating. I just simply don't respond...	On Monday morning march to her locker and say "hey, do you want to go to homecoming with me?" I know it's scary but that's how you've got to do it.
Ladies: if there's a piece of advice you could share with the whole male population, what would it be?	All the stereotypes thrown at women are projections because really apply to men - men are the hormonal beasts, men are quick to flip out, men have delicate feelings and are unpredictable	When a woman is mad or acting grumpy or whatever, assume she has a valid reason. Never ask her if she is on her period at these times--to do so is a surefire way for her to get even more mad at you. Besides, to assume that her feelings are irrelevant based upon whether or not she is on her period is pretty douchey.
She slept with someone before the "exclusive" talk and just told me. How would you handle it?	People are gonna fuck man, how can you expect someone to be faithful after 3 weeks of "talking everyday". If you want someone to stay faithful you talk about it right off the bat.	Between the recent big breakup, the self-harm, and the new drinking habits, it's not clear to me that she's ready for dating. Also, you have to pay for everything and drive everywhere, and now she gets bored and bangs other dudes. I mean, I'm probably a lot older than you, but I would have zero patience for any of that. Do what you want, but I suspect you could do way better than what you've got here.
Who are terrible feminists and why?	The ones that say you can't be feminist and Zionist. Of course I can. Jews have the right to self-determination and it's bigoted to say otherwise. You can't be feminist and anti-Semitic. That's not intersectional.	I'm not a fan of the current liberal feminist trend where anything and everything a woman does is supposedly feminist and non-problematic as long as a woman says she chooses it. Other than that, I'd consider terrible feminists people who are hypocrites, who espouse equality but don't carry it out in their private lives and act out roles or support institutions or ideas that are fundamentally unequal.
Ladies, how have you been unintentionally creepy?	>but it's really applicable to anyone who was/is socially clueless at some point! No. Stop claiming it's about social cluelessness. It isn't. Creepy is not the same as cringey or awkward.	When I'm walking my dogs through my neighborhood, and I pass a house with it's blinds open I've caught myself watching the people inside. I won't stop or get closer or anything, but I'm fascinated by strangers, and can't help myself.
Fellow men of Reddit, how was dating in your 20’s different than dating in 30’s (or was it the same)?	The older I get the less I trust or respect women. Dating went from an attempt to find true love to a collection of single moms who come over for sex when schedules permit. I'm sure the women didn't change, just my perspective over time.	Well, the older I got the more picky I got, and the more baggage everyone had. Mid 20s was more difficult than later or early 20s. At about 22-24 the girls your age are hitched or want an older guy, at about 29 all of a sudden a flood of younger girls want you because you're somewhat established, and they want in on the ride.
What's something you probably shouldn't find attractive, but do?	Men capable and willing to dish out abuse. I had a thing for Christian Bale longer than I should have.	Acne scars/ imperfect skin-especially when they're not insecure about it. I don't know, I guess I love the fact that you can have this perfect guy flaunt an imperfection- the majority (not all) of guys I've been into didn't have clear skin and I was just into it.
Have you ever been told you couldn’t do something simply because you were a woman?	Not really, if you don't count mundane stuff like "don't fight with boys, you're a girl" or "don't climb trees you are a girl" or "weightlifting isn't for women they should do fitness". Not that it ever stopped me, on the contrary, I used to be a kid who would intentionally do anything somebody told me not to do, even if I didn't really want to do it in the first place. This behaviour backfired more than once, of course. So I don't really see any problem with sexist remarks like "women can't do this and that". Feminists say it discourages women, but I think it may discourage some, but will encourage many more.	I was sent to a fundamentalist Jesus camp when I was 12 (it was a mistake). The first night there we were told girls weren’t allowed to: swim, ride the horses, sit next to the boys, wear tampons, take birth control, hug each other for too long, cut our hair too short, wear “boy clothes” like hoodies, or disagree with our fathers and brothers. Camp went very well.
Inexperienced/timid guys- Can I put your hands on my boobs when we're making out?	No. Because If you do that then some guy will assume it is permission to rip your shirt off, titty fuck you, and to give you a giant Peter North facial. Then he will flip you over and dry fuck your ass until he drops another giant load deep in your colon. He will then make you suck out all of his man goo out of your own ass with a crazy straw. All because you put his hands on your breasts. Be careful what you initiate because it is a crazy world out there with some real freaks.	Yes. Most guys who are timid are so because they are not sure where the acceptable limits are and are afraid to cross them. You putting my hands on your boobs is explicitly saying "grope me" which is the exact kind of blunt invitation someone like me needs.
What is the most ridiculous thing a man (or woman) has done to try to get you in bed?	I've had girls try to physically force themselves on me a few times. They were always drunk, and they were probably used to being able to fuck anyone they throw themselves at, so I'm not sure I can blame them much. Interesting how that is amusing to me, where if I was a woman it would surely be terrifying.	Honestly, I just find negging the most ridiculous thing in the world as an attempt to get a woman into bed or interested in any way. I could never make someone I like (or someone I'm completely apathetic to for that matter) feel bad about themselves. I would feel just awful. And to use that as a way to win them over with manipulation just leaves me wondering if people who do it have any respect for women at all or if they've ever actually felt love and how nice it is to treat someone well.
How can you get yourself to be more motivated in life and do the things you need to accomplish when you are struggling from anxiety and depression?	Hi, If you are a believer in the Lord, pray all your anxiety and depression to him. Pray that your mind becomes at ease and the you open your heart to him and allow him to pour joy in your heart. &#x200B; A non-religion related answer would be to focus on your self and think about what you want for yourself. Listen to your favorite type of music and reflect on the obstacles you surpassed to be in the present today. Think about the outcome that is waiting for you after you accomplish your goals. Think about how better you will feel once you reach your goals. Vent to a friend and don't hold back.	I think a lot of recovery comes when you start doing things even when you don't feel motivated. Motivation often comes after you start accomplishing things and even if motivation never shows up, you still get the satisfaction of knowing that you can do things even when you don't want to. I have an anxiety disorder but I've realized that people without anxiety or depression still struggle and get anxious and unmotivated and the only difference between me and them was that they were doing it anyway. So I started doing it anyway.
Guys, would you mind if a girl approached you in public and complimented your appearance?	Seeing as you think hes attractive...he prob is in general...so he wont be intimidated, and if it were me I would be attempting to plant a seed to Fuck you since your attraction is obvious	Mind? It would make my fucking day. A girl complimented my shirt once and it left me on high for the rest of the day. Yes, definitely, go for it. Approach him in private, tell him you find him attractive and introduce yourself. It will go well, guaranteed.
If Instagram is where the attractive and photogenic spend their time what does that make Reddit?	Reddit is where the morbidly obese neckbeards congregate to do...whatever it is neckbeards do. Oh, and where the socially awkward or anxious can say whatever they want.	In The Office, James Spader's character criticizes the Black Eyed Peas as rock for people who don't like rock, rap for people who don't like rap, and pop for people who don't like pop. Then maybe reddit is 4chan for people who don't like 4chan, tumblr for people who don't like tumblr, and pinterest for people who don't like pinterest.
What are some compliments that you have received or given that are unforgettable?	“When I get to that, I want you to be the father of my child” What was so awesome about this, was that my friend who said this to me is a lesbian. To be chosen as a father by someone you are in a romantic relationship with is great - but being chosen without the “filter” of romantic love and purely by “objective” human evaluation is the best compliment I’ve ever had.	“I’m pretty sure that you might be partly a genius” - boss. I’m absolutely not a genius. I changed careers to something completely different. I have no qualifications, I fell into the interview accidentally (they actually offered me the role above what I applied for based on interview alone) and I’m always terrified that I actually don’t know what I’m doing and making a huge mess of it. But I’m determined to do it right, so I fuckin’ threw myself at it and really pushed myself to make it work. It’s stressful and tiring and draining but I really enjoy it. I know he was blowing smoke because he immediately asked me to Do a Thing, but it was a nice moment of vindication for me.
Men, have you ever had a woman accuse you of being sexist or anti feminist and what caused it?	Feminists are very vocal online, so popular message boards and media sites feel dense with SJW's. Most women I know don't call themselves feminists. But I've never actually encountered these adamant feminists in real life. I think it's because they know that without their safe space filters and echo chambers, they'll get torn apart by the logic of reality Also, I never went to college, so that probably spared me from them.	I was talking to my mom and sister. We got on the topic of children. I personally don't want to have children, but if I did have a son, I had a name for him. My mom asked me if I had a name if I had a daughter, I said no. She called me a sexist pig that was no better than my father. I love talking to mom.
Ladies, what is your most oh my god I want to hide under a rock embarrassing story?	I got drunk on Halloween with some friends, who wanted to go into town to a club. I had drank the same amount as usual, but the subway into town... That swaying pushed me overboard and I threw up when we got off. Then I *apparently* laid on the floor of the subway station until I felt better. (I definitely don't remember that) Anyways we came back to my apartment and they made sure I didn't die. It was hugely embarrassing and I ruined Halloween ):	I had a psychotic breakdown. During this breakdown, I was "in love" with some dude I was close to. I sent this dude nudes, erotic videos and audios, and I sent a cute little painting to his house. I was literally batshit at the time. You know that "behavior change" side effect with medications? Wheeeee that's what happened with me. A year later, I'm pretty recovered and back to normal. I wish that I could erase that period of my life, but I have to live with it. Forever.
Women who were in cults or had/have family members in cults, how did you and/or your family members escape? Or if they are still in one how do you deal with them being in the cult still?	A lot of people dont believe that Mormonism is a cult. It is. I was a part of it. I have snuck away, under the radar, but my family doesn't know. I lie about most aspects of my life to my family. It is ridiculously hard. I hope someday to be able to tell then, but for now, the cons outweigh the pros.	One of my Aunties has two children by David Koresh of WACO fame. The big reason I remember her giving was when she got so severely scolded for taking Sky to the hospital for a broken arm, because now he was in the system. This combined with his encouraging them to violence and suicide in the case of an attack, led her to run away home with the boys before the whole thing went down.
What is a BIG thing your SO does that may be hurting your relationship?	He moved to the US to do his masters. That... bastard! But he cried and said he loved me the day he left. Its been five days. I miss him so much	No sex. I'm lucky if we get it maybe once a month. It's an issue that I continually bring up that just gets brushed aside
My girlfriend of 3 years, and first love, just left me. Guys, how did you deal with your first heart break?	I was 15 when my first girlfriend cheated on me with a one feet shorter than me chinese guy who happened to have a lot of money and paid her for having sex with him... Twice.. Broke my heart, I didn't want to talk to girls for like two years, had a lot of trust issues and it heavily influenced me in my relationship even after those two years. Worst part? She was my classmate, so there was no chance of avoiding her the following year. She failed the class though, which I was kinda glad about.	All I can recommend is time and distraction. Put some more time into your favourite hobby and at some point you'll realise you can do better than someone who cheats on you. I know for now it is hard and it hurts, but it will pass.
In your current situation, would the advantages of being a man outweigh the benefits of being a woman?	In some ways. Men get promoted faster and treated with more respect by patients (which makes it easier to care for them). Also being stronger would be a plus. However I really like being a woman plus my relationship would definitely end and that would be sad.	I'm about to be travelling alone in foreign countries for about 2 1/2 weeks. All the travel warnings seem to think so.
What does your handwriting look like?	It's a more relaxed form of cursive, with a softer indent and medium-sized font. Unless I'm scribbling notes down, in which it goes narrow neat super quick. Gotta love the flexibility of the fingers. :D [Here you go!](https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13565620_1744293612492437_1272410696_n.jpg?oh=5cbf8a1d833e0561f017bc421e4c48a2&oe=58FFD554)	It's a more relaxed form of cursive, with a softer indent and medium-sized font. Unless I'm scribbling notes down, in which it goes narrow neat super quick. Gotta love the flexibility of the fingers. :D [Here you go!](https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/13565620_1744293612492437_1272410696_n.jpg?oh=5cbf8a1d833e0561f017bc421e4c48a2&oe=58FFD554)
What's the worst thing that you've ever said to your spouse, with no ill intent?	Effectively told her to "get medicated" to help with her anxiety/depression. She doesn't want medication, is afraid it'll change her personality, who she is as a person. I'm in agreement with her. I was referring to something more akin to "a really small dose" to help take the edge off but not affect her personality. But of course it doesn't get heard that way.	What I said: "I'm glad you're not worried about looking pretty like all the other girls I've been with" What I meant: "It's awesome that you're comfortable with yourself and aren't super insecure about not looking your 100% best all the time" What she heard: "You're uglier than the many *many* other girls I've been with but it's cool because I don't have to wait for you to get ready everywhere we go" It went over about as well as you might think...
What is it that makes the beard unpopular for politicians (and other groups)? Could a famous bearded role model change that?	If you're taking about those gross bushy beards that have become the latest fad, it's because they typically just don't look good. If you're talking about stubble, that might be because it can be seen as a sign of ageing or unkemptness, depending on how it grows in.	Blame it on The Greatest Generation. Upstanding role model community heroes and future leaders came home from the war all clean shaven. And that is when professionalism became associated with being clean shaven. They weren't allowed beards because their gas masks had to fit.
How important is penetrative sex in a relationship?	A good partner is going to let his needs, which are actually wants, go by the wayside because your needs are greater and require that. You want to be able to do that, but you can't, which is okay. Focus on yourself, and remember that a good romp doesn't need to be penetrative. You can enjoy oral stimulation, manual stimulation, or teasing. Mutual masturbation may help. You can both enjoy each other in ways that won't require you to have what most people consider sex, but is still wonderful.	In a normal situation, pretty important. In your situation? I can jack off. Your health is way more important. Keep fighting. You got this.
Men of Reddit, do you go out to bars and clubs alone and if so, how do you not appear creepy?	How not to appear creepy: Step 1. Don't act creepy. Step 2. If not sure see step 1. People are there to have a good time you should too. Nobody is going to be paying you any attention unless you do something crazy.	I go out alone all the time. To dinner, to bars, to the store. Usually no one finds me creepy, actually many people strike up conversations with me. I usually sit near the end of the bar away from everyone.
Late bloomers, what surprised you about whats involved in relationships?	That you learn the horrible truth that sex with someone you care about is best but sex is still too good and relationships when young take too much out of you to want one but no sex sucks in comparison.	How at times you feel it's a meat market. I've never had a lot of friends, so hence I haven't had a lot of women hit on me. When my social circle expanded I got a ton of women showing interest. Also your relationship doesn't seem to have a lot of privacy from her friends. Which was hard for a mostly private person like me.
If YOU could choose how you were going to be proposed to, how would you want it to happen?	No slow buildup. I don't get those proposals that are just an entire fun day that ends with a proposal. Everytime someone shares one of those stories, they're playing coy and pretending they didnt know it was coming... but it's totally obvious that it was happen. Had a friend and her boyfriend both tell me the date they were going to get engaged, later that weekend when she's sharing the story, she's trying to make it sound like a surprise, but it obviously wasn't. Ideally, I'd like a "y'know we're going to marry each other, right?" "oh yeah, of course." *pulls ring out* "wanna make it official?" OR something superficially horrible to happen, like falling in mud, before the proposal.	On top of a mountain, hiking. Or after a thunderstorm in the middle of the grasslands. It sounds specific but we have been in that situation before and it was incredibly romantic. It's my favorite photo of us :)
How many of you have gone to a party [where you don't really know anyone] alone?	I don't recommend it. Usually everyone just ends up staring at you trying to figure out how they know you.	I have been and it can be tough. It depends entirely on the people who are there if you are going to feel active. My advice, just get hammered and have fun, if you get off putting vibes or something then dip. Fuck em
What "beauty hack" do you think is malarkey??	"use conditioner instead of shaving cream" - But, that would take so much more conditioner since it doesn't foam up - i would use the bottle up fast! Most of the time I just don't use shave cream at all and it actually makes me cut my legs less.	Coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning it can clog your pores. I am not going to use that shit on my acne-prone skin! If it works for you, great, but I hate seeing it touted as a product *everyone* should use as a moisturizer.
Women who have had cosmetic surgery, what did you do and what were the side effects?	I got my boobs done, and just as another poster said-any self esteem issues were gone over night. (Of course this will vary for people, due to different issues) I was a 36B and got 600cc silicons HP unders. I’m 6’0 FWIW. I feel like God just forgot to add tits to my formulation, so I feel pretty great, now.	I got double eyelid surgery in Korea. I got into wearing double eyelid tape (common trend for Asians with single eyelids) when I was in high school, and unfortunately had the bad habit of not properly removing the tape correctly. So my lids got really saggy and I got them corrected. Very happy I got the surgery done. My eyes look pretty natural, I like how they look now. :)
What are some safety tips all women should know?	I'd recommend being armed and alert 100% of the time you leave your house. If you can't/ don't want/ are not able to carry a pistol, then at least mace, in hand, every time. Not just most of the time. Walk with purpose. Don't keep earphones in. Unless you're in the vast minority, you probably cannot beat a male- likely with nothing to lose- in a fight; use the "flight" part way, way before the "fight." Safety is way more important that manners or offending someone - if a stranger or party or situation feels uncomfortable or makes your Jimminy Cricket tick... LEAVE!	I think it's worth mentioning that you are statistically more likely to know the person *assaulting you. So I would be careful of who you hang around with, let walk you home, meet online etc.
How would you deal with a girlfriend's intrusive male friend?	I live my life by a simple rule, at least when it comes to things like this: If I've asked you to stop doing something three time and you keep doing it, I'm going to hit you hard enough that you stop doing it.	There's a good chance he's into your girlfriend. When I got engaged to my now-wife, one of her guy friends that very obviously harbored a long-time crush on her tried to convince her to postpone the wedding. In my case it was just kind of hilarious/sad, but in this case it seems to be fucking with your psyche a bit. Definitely worth a conversation with her, just keep your tone very non-accusatory and tell her how you feel.
Today, I'm moving in with my S.O. I'm nervous, since I've never done something like this. What are some essential tips you could share?	Don’t poop for the first few weeks, just hold it in until she is more accustomed to you. You don’t want to scare her off.	From what I have heard in counseling. You need to learn how to be separated together. Give the other person and give yourself some space, being with your partner is wonderful but every human needs some alone time from time to time.
What are some free/inexpensive things you do when you're low on cash but still need to get out of the house and have fun?	There are 2 theaters near me that have $5 movie days. I'm sure if you look there's at least one in the area that offers the same deal.	Hike, take pictures, or a combination of both. For instance, I've texted a friend and asked them to give me random items for a "scavenger hunt" that I'd take pictures of for proof to show them I found it. Stuff like a lady bug, wild berries, a spider web, etc. (mostly natural things because of the locations I choose to go to). So then I go off looking for the things they told me to find.
Guys how often do you check social media accounts of the girls you're interested in?	> Guys how often do you check social media accounts of the girls you're interested in? I don't. I'm not into the creepy stalker vibe where someone tries to find out everything about a person, instead of actually asking them. The most I MAY do is a Google search, if I have reason to think they are into something sketchy.	I seem to be the outlier. I check regularly, either to see if I'm interested or just to get a buzz off of her prettieness. Does backfire... every once in a while I will like a new girl, and I will look at her photos so much that I talk myself out of it. Sometimes, the allure of being around someone special can't be duplicated online.
What do you prefer.. Large parties or small gatherings?	Funny thing is if you're introverted/asocial a large crowd is better for you because you get lost in it. No one is there to single you out because other people are there to have fun and they're not focused on you. A large part of self-conciousness and low self-esteem is focusing too much on yourself, especially your negatives and you begin to believe others are doing the same to you. Small gatherings would give people more of a chance to single you out. I'm introverted, I'm asocial/shy but when I go to parties/concerts I'm there to enjoy myself and usually no one is giving me shit. Small gatherings though? Easier to be zeroed out and put on the spot, and I don't like being put on the spot. So yeah I like large parties, just because I'm introverted doesn't mean I don't like to he around others getting lively.	Standard cop-out answer of "it depends." I would tend to prefer the small gathering, but sometimes I like a large party if I'm feeling especially sociable.
What are your thoughts on your significant other being able to track your location?	I feel like anyone that’s disagreeing with this might not want to share their location with their SO because of shady reasons. I share my locations with my family, parents included, and I would have no problem sharing it with a SO because I have nothing to hide, and I know what the benefits are of it. I don’t use it to creep. If there’s trust in your relationship, what harm would it cause? But 8 months might be too soon for this, your call on that.	When my now husband and I were LDR, we would travel 3 hours every weekend to see each other, leaving around 3 am on Monday morning to make it to work on time. We ended up turning it on with each other for the “dead in the ditch” scenario. Really helped when my car broke down en route and he could come right to me to fix it too. It has its uses, but we also had no trust issues nor did we use it to check up on each other.
Men, have you ever "lost control" around a woman? If so, what were the repercussions?	No. Women are sacred. If you are going to lose your shit, do it in private or blow off steam with the guys. The only way I've ever come close is to have had difficulties letting go of certain women and this really just hurt me and was a potential annoyance to them. Always be aware of your shit!	I attempted suicide in high school by downing a lot of pills, which thankfully failed but I was hospitalized for a while after. After I took the pills I was wandering around just kind of waiting for it to happen and decided I didn't want to die without at least knowing what a girl felt like and groped a girls tits and ass. Rather aggressively. At the time I was a self centered little shit and deeply regret both the suicide attempt and my actions during. I can't imagine how that effected her later on.
What's the worst a woman has done to you on a date?	Was a feminist broke down what it means to be a woman in this day and age and how hard it was to be woman. Proclaimed that women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. I of course was elated at this news. When the waitress gave us the bill I handed her the bill and said women deserve equality and can do anything just as good as a man can. That is when she said she didn't bring any cash with her cause it was the first date and men should pay. Of course I raged on the inside and paid the bill.	I'm a 5'5" guy and I went on a date with a 5'8" girl. The entire night she kept saying stuff like "Oh my god you are SO short!" and "Does it suck for you, trying to find girls at your height?" Yeah, that was a fast evening.
Pet owners in long-term relationships, how do you deal with not being the "favorite"?	I'm always the favorite. I'm dominant and very good at reading animal body language. Being dominant and calm is a way to get dogs to prefer you. With cats, they just like me, lol.	While I'm our cat's favorite, my husband has found some comfort in figuring out that our cat prefers to play almost exclusively with him. The cat wants to sleep, be pet by, be fed by, etc. with me, but when it comes to chasing the feather, it's aaaall him. Finding the things that you can have just-the-two-of-you is great. Maybe you could set up a way to be the only provider of your pet's favorite treat?
My girlfriend is currently the centre of my life (by choice), is this bad?	Yes, it is. Never make your woman your mission. You will lose both your mission and your woman this way. However, it sounds like you have outgrown your old friends (because they are stuck in high school party mode, and you aren't). Make your studies your mission, and make some new friends, ones that you do not share with her. This will keep you and your relationship healthy.	I wouldn't call what you're describing as making your gf the center of your life. It just sounds to me like you're growing out of the partying lifestyle while at the same time focusing more on your relationship. The two are only loosely connected, although who's to say that if you were single you wouldn't still enjoy all the partying? Tbh it's a natural progression for most guys, I think. All the drinking and carrying on is fun when you're late teens/early 20s but as you get older it just doesn't hold the same appeal. Then you get all responsible and shit.
Ladies, what are the things that your SO does that you think is cute but others would find weird?	He sings and claps and makes weird noises all the time. He'll just start making up a song about something and doing a weird dance with little to no provocation. He does this usually at least once in the morning when I'm getting ready for work.	He laughs in his sleep. He's really easy to sleep next to, doesn't snore, doesn't fidget. But he has this creepy, maniacal chuckle that only comes out while he's sleeping.
What was the first step you took to change your life for the good?	Lifting weights. From the lifting I saw with my own eyes the power of my will to change my body and change how every single person I met would perceive me. I heard a lot of the new agey self improvement psycho-babble from lifting communities and was inspired at that time to start meditating, reading psychology books, and trying to take conscious control of as much of my life as possible. Sir Richard Branson was once asked what one habit would he have people adopt in order to change their being to shift their mindset to that of a more successful person and he said intense exercise.	Mid twenties. Decided to go back to university and get my engineering degree. With my wife supporting us I went back at 27. We had 2 kids while I was going, graduated with honors. Make a decent $100k/year after being out for 5 years. I think it was a good decision
What's an argument/difference of opinion that you seem to always have with men that you don't with other women?	Good evening guys and gals. We've had to remove a frankly staggering amount of invalidation from this thread. If you're going to comment, please keep in mind you are not allowed to tell users that their subjective opinion is objectively wrong. I am now unlocking this thread, but if there is no improvement, I will take it out behind the woodshed and put it out of its misery. It would be the kind thing to do. Edit: This is why we can't have nice things. Locked.	Good evening guys and gals. We've had to remove a frankly staggering amount of invalidation from this thread.

Do men really think women are illogical?	Here's some interesting reading from an article that's as old as the internet itself (which I won't link to because the rest of it is a lot of misogynistic hate): >Women are basically emotionally driven. If they feel it, they do it, period. Then they rationalize it to themselves later. Nothing is more meaningful, or compelling, to a woman than (1) the way she feels and (2) learning more about her own inner self and having emotional realizations. That's why women love astrology, chick flicks, soap operas, stupid Cosmo quizes that supposedly reveal info about yourself, etc.	Honestly, I think everyone is illogical. No-one seems to actually apply logical thought processes to their life. Women in particular? Not really. Some women are more illogical than some men, and vice versa. It balances out.
Women who cohabitated before marriage, how do you feel about that decision in hindsight?	Marriage is a legal arrangement. There is nothing inherently special about it. Living together in love and cooperation is the thing that is important, and I would highly recommend figuring out if that is something you actually want (by testing it) before you make it a legal issue. I've lived with my girlfriend for about a year now, and it's great. But honestly, if it weren't for issues of maintaining a legal citizenship status (I'm American, she's Canadian), I doubt we'd get married at all. Frankly, not living with someone before marriage is a near perfect analogy for not looking before you leap.	Living with my husband before we got married was the best decision. I got to see how compatible we were seeing each other day in and day out.
Ladies, what back-handed compliments have you been given?	"You really seem to have it together for a 20-something". I'm 26, and to my way of thinking I *should be expected* to have my shit together, but apparently I'm alone in that.	*I thought you were such a bitch until I actually got to know you.* I've gotten several variations of that comment over the years. Resting bitch face is real. :(
How many of you lovely ladies really don't have much dating experience at all?	Your friendship group may be odd. While I'm on my third serious relationship, a lot of my friends are on okcupid, tinder, hinge, etc. We're all in our early to mid-twenties. I've never used any of those sites because I prefer meeting people in real life, but most of my friends are going on a bunch of unsuccessful dates or meeting a guy, dating for less than a month, and then having it fizzle out.	I'm 22, and I've never been on a date, never been kissed, and never have had a SO. It's not that I'm not interested. I just wanted to focus more on school. If it happens, it happens. I'll be going to grad school in a year or two, so anytime from now on is when I'm okay with it.
What is currently the hottest, most juiciest gossip you've heard recently that concerns someone within your social circle or people you used to know?	There was a rumor that went around at my school that a freshman was pregnant. I don't know if it was true or not.	My roommate and her boyfriend are currently having a spat. Roommate found out that her boyfriend kissed *her* friend about 6 months ago, boyfriend found out roommate kissed and spooned *his* friend (while the three of them shared a bed together). College.
DAE not know what they want to do in life?	ITT: A bunch of college grads that got degrees in fields that they know nothing about and upon graduating, found out that they hated it.	I have a history degree. And no interest in teaching. I'm five years into a career at a bank in IT. My job is the thing I do for 40 hours a week. I have had the jobs I thought I wanted and they were too intense and draining to do full time. I have no idea what I want to be when I grow uo. (Currently 29). I do know what kind of person I want to be: involved in my community, a good friend, kind of weird. My job pays for me to do things I love in my free time (see concerts, do Rocky Horror, work with local nonprofits, etc.). I'm okay with that balance.
Men, regarding your committed significant other's Tinder use purely for "ego boosting", what are your thoughts on this?	As long as she's not going through with meeting guys and letting them buy her drinks or something then I'm okay if she gets a little ego boost over seeing how many people swipe right. It seems pretty harmless to me.	Yeah I'm against this. I wouldn't wanna be with someone whose self esteem was so low that she needed to get random matches on tinder to feel validated
If someone is being mean to you, how often do you feel like being physically aggressive?	Depends on the mean, if a guy(or girl) is bothering me or pushing me around and getting on my nerves, I'll probably slap them. but if they're just being verbally abusive, I'll ignore it..	A lot when I was a kid. Since then I've learned to tamp it down...basically I have two modes: lose my shit or fall apart and cry. I pretty much always take the latter to avoid the former. When it's particularly personal, I feel VERY physically aggressive and really have to work to not act on it.
What do guys feel about eating out a girl?	Absolutely love it. I love giving my partner pleasure. I love the taste, the smell, everything. I've done all kinds of crazy stupid shit in the name of eating pussy. I once ate my ex out for the entirety of a movie, one of the first times I did it, just do find out what I was doing. Got her off in the end, and whenever we saw that movie playing we'd laugh. I went down on my ex so much that when I pulled up after finishing, it looked like she was bleeding. Turns out it was me. I had been down there so long and had been going so nuts that I cut my tongue or lip open without noticing. And of course, I'm fairly certain every decent pussy-eater has come up with his tongue/lips kinda numb. Sign of a good job.	Oh my god it's my favorite thing. My favorite is when it nearly turns into a goddamn MMA fight before she climaxes. I had a girl wrap her legs around my head, squeeze and then try to push my head away. I grabbed her hips, held my breath, and finished the damn job.
Men, What was the "last straw" in your past relationship for you?	She didn't get along with my family, and my family didn't think she was right for me. Whether you get along with your family or not, they know you better than anyone else and, generally, want what is best for you.	My ex-wife, 5 years ago, driving while intoxicated with my son in the car. She nearly got both of them killed. I gave her a choice between her family or the drugs and alcohol. She chose the latter. I kicked her out, filed for divorce, got full custody of my son, and haven't seen or heard from her since. Moved on and currently engaged to an amazing woman. Edit: Spelling
I just said “You too,” when the pizza delivery driver said “Enjoy your meal.” What’s the dumbest thing you’ve said because you didn’t think before you spoke?	I just said “You too,” when the pizza delivery driver said “Enjoy your meal.” What’s the dumbest thing you’ve said because you didn’t think before you spoke?	“Thank you” were my words of condolence to a parent that had lost a child in the funeral home receiving line. Not at all what I was trying to convey.
i am thinking of quitting Facebook. People who don't use Facebook/social media how has your life been changed?	I'm 29 years old. I have never and will probably never have a Facebook account. I don't really miss it. There are so many other ways to reach out to friends and family. I haven't really felt compelled to get an account.	I heavily reduced my usage of social media this last January. I'll tell you, it has been a tremendous change for the better. I maybe only log on to Facebook and Twitter once a week. Here is what I have experienced: 1. My relationships and bonds with people are stronger, because we communicate in real life. 2. I am not glued to my phone constantly, which makes days more enjoyable and fulfilling. 3. I'm not comparing myself/my achievements to others'. 4. Social media has the potential to be a powerful tool, however, I have found many people care entirely too much about it. Those are the main ones I can think of now. I recommend at least significantly reducing usage. It has been a great experience and feeling for me, and I'm sure you will find similar results.
Am I a creeper dad if I'm a friend with my daughter's friends (male and female) on facebook?	If I was in your position, I would make it a requirement for her even being allowed to have a Facebook account. You are a single parent, and your daughter is only 16, you SHOULD be keeping an eye on what she is doing online, too many kids are getting themselves in trouble and posting inappropriate things that will come back to haunt them when they are adults and have better insight and decision making skills. I get that you are concerned it will look bad because you are a guy. You are completely justified, its disappointing and frustrating that our society is so paranoid that you feel like you have to defend what is basically supervising your daughter just because you are a single father. I doubt it would be any kind of an issue if you were a single mother instead.	Female mid-20s here: You seem to be staying away from the creeper zone. As long as you don't go wandering off and start 'liking' bikini pics of her friends, you're in the clear. I like how you've been pro-active in having female friends over when there might be any chance of creeper allegations. (It sucks that society is super suspicious of Dads though.)
Men with no waifu, how is your laifu?	>not having a waifu fucking normies man i will give everyone in this thread a waifu based on their comments so you can be enlightened.	>not having a waifu fucking normies man i will give everyone in this thread a waifu based on their comments so you can be enlightened.
Men who hate their mothers: Why?	I don't hate *her*, I hate things she did to me: * got me circumcised * raised me in a church * crafted me into a Nice Guy™	She took my sister and I to the homes of the guys she was cheating on my dad with and would put us in the basement (lights off) while they fucked upstairs and we'd have to wait for several hours sometimes. That bothered me so much as a kid and the memories of it nearly ruined sex for me. She'd beat up my sister, and told me what a bad son I was. She made us feel worthless. I still keep in touch and our relationship is getting better. But I have no intention of letting her near my family if I ever start one
Mothers of AW, what's something your child does/did, that made you think "that's so mini me"?	Don't have kids, BUT I have two kittens. My little boy kitten Clint likes to sleep with a paw dramatically thrown across his eyes, just like I do. I didn't think my girl kitten Natasha was that similar to me, until I asked my SO how something so small takes up so much space and he pointed out that I do exactly the same thing when I sleep.	One time I watched him cut his pancake into tiny pieces and pour syrup on each individual piece while being very careful to make sure the syrup didn't spill over. That's how I knew he belonged to me.
Why are so many men in this sub so bitter?	Because those who are not angry and bitter wouldn't waste their time on an internet forum. Those of us who are willing to waste our time here are most likely bitter. Want to find happy people? go outside. Want to find miserable people? well, you've already found us. This obviously isn't the case for everyone on here. Some people are way too cheerful. It's disgusting.	Welcome to the internet. It's absolutely common that you find more negative voices about almost any topic, than you find positive ones. It's just a normal phenomenon, that people who are happy about stuff don't usually talk about it, but people who are not want to complain and vent and therefore it seems, that an entire community is like that. There's no other way than simply dealing with it.
Something I never understood: why is a bikini pic on social media OK but a bra and panties pic isn't?	I have long been confused by this, but I assume it is because we are trained not to assume that someone in a bikini is putting themself forward for sex, and that someone in their scivvies is. It's bullshit, and it's nonsense, and it's slut shaming, and it's rape culture, but it's true.	Because swimwear is supposed to be seen and worn outdoors whereas underwear isn't. Also, underwear is often way more flimsy than swimsuit material.
Guys seem to complain about being in the "friendzone" more than women. Do you think men want to date their opposite sex friends more? Or do they just complain about it more often?	They complain about it more. They think that kindness and friendship buys them pussy and get pissed when they don't get what they think they're entitled to. I liken it to a spoiled child in a toy store whose mom told him no. Edit: I don't know why you guys have jumped all over me when I am not the only person who has expressed this opinion in this thread.	I think the whole 'friendzone' issue stems from the differences in how men and women approach friendships. For women, friendship means emotional intimacy. For men, friendship is less about sharing feelings and more about just doing things together. So when a man puts time and effort into developing emotional intimacy with a woman and that intimacy is reciprocated, he thinks that means she's interested, when really, that's just how women make friends. So the guy feels like he is was lead on or feels like he is owed a romantic relationship/sex because of the emotional energy he's invested in the relationship. If a woman gets rejected, there's not the same sense of wasted energy because for her, the way the relationship developed is the norm. She's more likely to put the blame on herself for not being up to par rather than on the man for wasting her time.
How do you sleep with your SO?	Sometimes with my dick inside her allll night. Usually just spooning with my arms around her and my hands on her tits	We share a queen bed and are both thin people, so we have quite a bit of space between us. Don't get me wrong, we both love a great cuddle when relaxing, but we both need our space when actually falling asleep.
What was your funniest childhood misconception?	I can remember becoming really interested in boobs and wishing that it was a mutual interest. Then I learned that it's actually fun for the lady too, if done correctly. Then I learned that it's just me that they don't want touching their boobs.	At some point in my overly religious upbringing I heard someone say "We should be teaching kids about God in schools, not handing out condoms!" Well, I was homeschooled. So I thought that kids in public school were being handed pamphlets full of sinful information and that those pamphlets were called "condoms."
Have you ever had a crush you absolutely did not want?	I have a crush on my personal trainer who has a gf! He's so hot haha it makes me sad that I'm over weight and feel like he'd never be interested in a curvy girl like me. Its an innocent crush nothing serious or heart wrenching but its terrible to feel like unattractive!	Definitely - my current crush is a co-worker. I like to be a professional person and I work in a professional environment so this kinda sucks. I mean, I like having a crush but not at work.
People trying to change themselves, what are you "working on"?	I trying to be less sarcastic and making less offensive jokes on my brother (he doesn't like them, but I usually just can't stop myself).	Trying to work on my confidence. I know that I am competent but my anxiety is telling me I am not.
Women who like their jobs, what do you do? How did you get to where you are today and do you have any regrets?	I own a farm that specializes in diversified livestock. We raise poultry, beef, pork and eggs that we sell locally at farmers markets. My husband left his previous employer and after kicking around for a year we decided to give it a try. It’s been a learning experience for me but no regrets.	Bartender. Decided I wanted to be a bartender, took a job at a not-yet-open chain restaurant location (because they needed so many people, their standards were low and they hired me with no bartending experience) and toughed out the shitty work environment for a year. It looks really good to have a full year at one bartending job on your resume. After a year, I took that experience to get a better bartending job at a nice restaurant, learned how to ACTUALLY bartend (not just shitty beer and premixed margaritas), and used that experience to get a laid-back job that I love. I make about the median income for my area and live well below my means, so I get to spend my money on fun things like tattoos and going out to eat. I regret not getting into bartending sooner.
I have no friends, no hobbies outside of my computer, and no clear idea of how to improve my life. What should I do?	Jesus man, if you want to join a gym, join a gym. It's not a social place. I spent two hours at my gym today and I only spoke to one person and even then it was just a "hey, how are you" to a girl who I see there every day.	You're not finding "*catch 22s*", you're making excuses to yourself why you can't improve your situation. For whatever reason there seems to be something holding you back emotionally from moving forward. Gyms have personal trainers on offer, hire one, that will solve both your lack of knowledge about exercise and the anxiety. Develop some new hobbies, you don't have to be enticed by them on the outset just willing. You will grow to enjoy them. That takes care of making friends. PS. Going to the gym can also be a venue for making new friends. Look, basically what I am saying is the only thing holding you back here is you. Now, if you're not ready to progress that is absolutely fine no one will judge you for that. But own that you are holding yourself back and why that is the case. Then work through that until you're ready.
What has been your experience with girls you match with on dating apps vs girls you get in real life?	In real life it's fairly easy for me to get what I'd consider 10's. Online I can barely get a fucking 5. And even then half of em are flakes.	I get a lot of professors and vegetarians. Across 3 different dating sites. I am neither a vegetarian nor was I ever a good student. I have no idea what's going on. For the most part, online dating has been a hilarious dumpster fire. It's one avenue among many, but it's still mostly terrible.
Men whose SOs have been sexually assaulted, how did you and your SO deal with it and how are you still dealing with it?	the fucked up part is that her friend left her while she went to the bathroom, vanished it seems while a strange man waits for her friend.. and then your girlfriend proceeded to allow the man to escort her to a hotel room before she got thrown on a bed and sexually assaulted. Some fish infested waters or story not told properly or fully. One doesn't just find themselves in a situation like that, alcohol induced or not.	> she went to the police but the police said if she wants to press charges, shes gonna have to stay in vegas for a week or come back after a week to deal with the progress, they told her its better if she doesn't, so and signed a paper with the hotel that she wont press charges. She cant go there again, she cant stay there for a week cause she has responsibilities, she has to work and make money to pay her bills.. That is waaaaay above reddit pay grade. Trauma aside, head to /r/legaladvice, they'll have advice on who to contact, because cops telling that, and hotels being that scummy is most likely not legal.
Women who married for reasons other than love, why did you marry and how is it working out?	Kind of answering your question. I married for love but some "friends" think I married to "win" at sibling rivalry, even though my brother and I are really close. (I married my brothers best friend) my brother was best man at our wedding and is really happy for us.	My aunt told me once that the only reason she married my uncle was to try and escape the turmoil that her family got thrown into when her father died. She was 20 and had been dating him (my uncle) for a few months. They've been married almost 50 years now. I'm not sure they really love each other anymore, but are just used to each other. Despite what my aunt likes to say. They bicker and argue all the the time, kinda treat each other like crap in a very passive aggressive way.
How would you like to be objectified as a male? If at all?	If we could switch with women on the objectification part, trust me, women would clamor to have that perk back in their lives within a year. :P	I had a girl in class that always slapped my butt atleast once a week because she thought I had a great butt. I miss her.
Let’s say you are offered five million dollars (tax free) in exchange for never drinking alcohol again. What do you do in this situation?	I'd probably take the five million Most people drink alcohol BECAUSE they're stressed about shit (which usually money would solve). Not to mention that there are many other drugs out there that could be a better substitute such as weed	These types of questions are no brainers, every time. For $5 million tax free, there very little (if any) vice a person won’t give up.
What do you think of anime?	Never seen it. I'm not interested in cartoons in general. That style is not visually appealing to me. I don't think most of the themes would appeal to me, either. I don't plan to give it a try, not unless a close friend really wanted me to.	I grew up on Yu-Gi-Oh, and have come to really enjoy shows such as Black Butler, InuYasha, Psychopass, Fullmetal Alchemist (both versions), and Parasyte. It's not that I'm a fan of "anime," per se. I simply enjoy compelling and unique storylines. Anime happens to deliver a lot of that. Plus, I do appreciate the artistic efforts of the animation. What I'm *not* a fan of is continued oversexualization of female characters, either as a fan service or as a joke. Take a newer anime - Seven Deadly Sins. The main character is shown *immediately* groping the token attractive/submissive girl, and that continues throughout the show. It's gross and I don't care for it.
Women who married other women, how did you decide what your surname(s) would be?	My wife really wants to change to my name but that isnt legal to do where we live Because they wanted to protect women from being "forced to change their names for marriage" and now just completely removed choice. That's freedom for ya...	We hyphenated. We decided whose name went first by which sounded better. One way rolled off the tongue much easier so that's what we stuck with. We toyed with doing some unique combination for our names but one combination sounded like a Dr. Seuss creature and the other most obvious combination was Cunter. "Hi, we're your new lesbian neighbors, the Cunter's." Yeah... not gonna happen.
What sparks an almost primal rage inside of you?	* Bullies. * Ideological differences. Often times I can have a conversation about politics, economics, gun control, etc without losing my shit. But sometimes, with certian people, I lose my shit. SJWs, teaparty folks, coworkers voting for Trump, sometimes they make me lose my shit. * People who can't admit hotdogs are sandwiches.	Being accused of lying when I'm telling the truth. I don't know why, it makes me fly off the handle.
Folks who live in "cool cities," what's something most people don't know about it?	Wtf Is a cool city? Is Melbourne a cool city, I think the stereotype is that we’re a war between the latte sipping hipsters and the meat pie smashing footy nuts with two sets of teeth between them. Which tbh is mostly true. Only thing they miss is our huge Greek and Italian population.	After you pay your rent, you won't have any money left to eat in these cool restaurants, go to cool events or be cool in general.
Married Women of Reddit, whats your awkward proposal story?	I was 18 and we were on a seaside holliday, we go out for a walk along the beach and im looking at some seaguls playing, I turn around and he is on one knee, I was in complete shock. Then I notice he is purposing with an empty box? I intrupted with 'is there supposed to be a ring?' He looked shocked and paniked. It was so windy by the sea that the ring had been blown out of the box. I said yes anyways and then by some miricle we found it! He was pretty gutted that he had messed up the purposal for me but I diddnt care. Since then we moved to a bigger city togeather to attend univeristy, the wedding is in a few months time and ive just had our first baby. Couldnt of picked a better guy	We were in Vegas for a fun trip about 9 months after we met. Drunk me said, “We should probably get married while we’re here, eh?” Drunk him said, “Yeah!” Woke up in the morning and avoided eye contact for a while, took in the shark show at the Mandalay Bay. On our way back to our hotel, he just bursts out, “Well are we getting married today or not?” Yup, we are and we did.
What was the most condescending piece of dating advice you've gotten from other guys?	"Treat women like shit, it's biological. They can't fight millenia of falling for alpha males." To his credit, he always has a girl friend. This one is on you ladies, if you're wondering why you always end up with assholes, stop dating assholes lol.	I used to be somewhat heavier than I am now. I still went out with women quite a bit, but it was mostly with women who were around my attractiveness level, i.e. girls who were a bit plump. One of my friends like to give me shit for dating fat chicks, nevermind the fact that his love life was limited to his right hand. If you haven't gotten laid in years you don't have "high standards" you're just shooting out of your league.
The co-founder of Tinder is creating a "women-first" dating app where women must make the first move. What are your first impressions of this idea?	didn't this exact thing fail like a little while ago? like every woman would just send a a generic opener to a thousand guys and essentially still force the guy to make the first actual move.	I actually downloaded Bumble tonight and I hate it. It forces you to import job and education info from Facebook. I don't want a bunch of strangers immediately knowing where I work and where I go to college.
What is a completely mundane thing you have very strong opinions about?	Crunchy, NOT creamy!!!!! If you give me a PB&J with f*cking creamy peanut butter, I will stare you down as throw it at the wall hard enough to make it stick.	People with selfies as their phone background, and post quotes on their social media to act as if they're enlightened piss me off.
What are some effective ways for deescalating an argument in your relationship?	I pay attention to my heart rate. If it's really fast, I'm probably not in the right state of mind. So I excuse myself and do some slow breathing until I feel calmer. At that point it's easier to really listen. My partner's also good at excusing himself if he needs a minute to calm down. Neither of is get offended when the other needs a minute. We understand the reasoning. Also, sometimes, just saying "I'm angry but I still love you" helps. It's a reminder that we're still on the same team.	I've always found that stopping for a snack usually helps. I swear most unnecessary arguments start because people are hungry.
Do you ever worry that you just might not find an SO for the rest of your life?	Nope. That's what cats are for. Edit: I got down voted for a cats comment? I thought this was Reddit.	Yes. I just try to make my life rich and full and rewarding so that I can be a good partner if he shows up.
To women who are physically active, how many times a week do you workout and what activities/sports do you do?	Currently: Monday: 1 hour belly dancing Tuesday: 1 hour stretching, 2 hours bodyweight strength training Wednesday: 1 hour parkour, 1 hour tumbling Thursday: 1 hour tumbling, 2 hours bodyweight strength training Friday: 1 hour parkour Saturday: 2 hours parkour Sunday: 1 hour aerial yoga, 1 hour stretching, 1.5 hours aerial arts (silks/lyra/trapeze) -------------------------------- starting in february: I'll be replacing all the parkour and tumbling with aerial classes. I also go downhill skiing on a semi regular basis. *Disclaimer: I am a man*	I don't have workouts. I just live actively. I don't own a car. I walk and bike everywhere I go. Typically between 5-10 miles a day, sometimes twice that on weekends.
It's Saturday! What should you be doing, and what are you actually doing?	I should probably be playing LoL because I won't have as much time for it tonight. Instead I'm just chillin on reddit.	I'm sitting in my living room listening to good music, sipping coffee and browsing reddit. Which is exactly what I should be doing on a Saturday, dammit!
Where do you look to meet someone?	I’m okay with being down voted. I rarely post on Reddit. When so do so I just leave honest and genuine comments. With that said, It’s really disturbing how many men now think they are at risk of being labeled as an assaulter. When in reality, being assaulted is something women have had to struggle with every day, and it’s always been accepted as an unfortunate part of society. Dudes, you are making up a problem for yourself when your ladies actually live with real problems every day. The down votes are a reflection of this overall complacency.	A good friend of mine walked up to a girl at a train station. They have been dating for 4 years now and are getting married next year! Ya never know...
Men of Askmen who have lived with female roommates what was the level of modesty around the house ? Did you discussed this beforehand ?	If one of them secretly wants you, that one will flaunt their body accidentally. If two of them secretly wants you, it can get ugly. This is how women work. Normally, none of them will want the male house mate, and you won't see any immodesty at all or if it does happen, it will be focused privately so only you see it.	I'm a guy who lived with 3 female roommates for a summer. We never talked about modesty, and we all just wore a towel around our bits when leaving the bathroom after a shower. It just was unspoken courtesy. We walked around in our underwear which nobody seemed to mind. We were rarely sober and a very merry bunch, so it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere.
Women who graduated with a degree in arts/social sciences, how did it turn out for you and what fields are you working in?	BA (hons) in fashion design. Am now a designer for a UK high street retailer. Ironically I never actually wanted to be a designer and was more interested in garment construction. Wouldn’t have it any other way now though.	Got a BA and MA in sociology. Still working on my PhD, while earning a living at a research institute. I love my job, but I'm really sick of classes and don't want to have to finish my degree. I think I could do ok sticking to the type of job I do now even if I drop out of my graduate program, but not having a PhD would really limit my upward mobility / options in general. So... struggling with that right now. I'm still incredibly interested in the subject matter. I love the project development and data collection phase. I just don't want to have to ever write another paper (and writing papers is a huge, seemingly inescapable part of it all).
How to be direct enough with guys to show you want to have sex with them?	I'm locking this post because it looks like the incel brigade has decided to stick their heads out from their asses to mass downvote again. Thanks a lot you chucklefucks.

Is it okay for me to buy my boyfriend new underwear?	>"Hey your underwear has holes in it, didn't you notice?" >"I don't buy new clothes, I don't care." What a fucking slob.	You're his girlfriend, tell him you want him to wear them for you and it makes his ass/package look great. Tell him it's an early Christmas gift for yourself.
My pug barfed and my Roomba tracked it all over the room. Ladies, how have your loved ones let you down today?	my kitty puked up his breakfast all over my roommate's clothes and i didn't notice it until i was running out the door to work so i had to leave it there.	My dog is an excited pee-er. Or maybe a submissive pee-er. I'm not sure. We were told by our vet that it's pretty normal for pitbulls and he's barely a year old, so he'll probably grow out of it. Still, when the first thing you're greeted by when you come home is a leg covered in pee, it gets pretty tiring. He's perfectly house and crate trained, and he tends to be okay with my mom and sister who live with him full time. But when I come home to visit I always get peed on.
In terms of compatibility, what are some traits or habits people often forget to watch out for before deciding to enter a marriage or long term relationship?	If they grew up with a family pet, how much of the daily responsibilities were theirs? If slim to none, don't get a dog, let alone have a kid with this person.	Their open mindedness.... To anything and everything. Most importantly their open-mindedness to your opinion and whether they are willing to listen to you, while also being accepting of their own faults and flaws. Because what seemed like good conviction or beliefs or cute stubbornness before, could just as easily become rigidity and just being an asshole, unwilling to compromise or listen and entertain the possibility of them being wrong.
Married men. How did you know it was time to propose?	How did I know it was time? When she told me. Everyone should have a starter-marriage in their 20s. It teaches them what to do right the next time.	This is one of those life questions where the answer goes like this: "If you have to ask, you're not ready."
Has there ever been a time when you weren't taken seriously for a medical complaint, and it turned out to be something serious? What happened and how do you feel about it?	Only my entire life. I have a genetic condition that has been showing symptoms since I was a toddler and I got a partial diagnosis and treatment for it not long after my 38th birthday. I'm still waiting for the genetic testing that will give me specifics, but at least I know it's not MS or Parkinsons or some other degenerative neurological disease.	When I was a young teen I started feeling sick and nauseous all the time. Like really really bad. Doctors said I was just nervous about school or something, cos teen girls are highly strung right? The nausea got so bad that I stopped eating, because I couldn't eat without feeling sick. Doctors decided that I was anorexic. Eventually I lost so much weight they put me in a psych hospital and started treatment for anorexia. Basically, I had to eat lots and lots, and have therapy about my body image and calories and stuff. It didn't help, obviously. Just last year, at 23, nearly ten years later, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, which is where my stomach actually doesn't work properly and makes me feel nauseous all the time. I wasn't making it up after all.
Have you ever hit a girl out of self defense? If so, what was the outcome after the incident?	Unless she has a knife, blunt weapon, or gets a complete absolute sucker punch there are very few, if any, women out there that are any physical threat to me on my guard. I wouldn't hit a woman for the same reason I wouldn't hit a child, discrepancy of force.	Yes. A girl hit me in a head with a skateboard because I was fighting with her brother (he started it). So I hit her back.
How do you flirt with a girl that you’re already friends with?	I leave my plate of food on the dining room table and excuse myself to the bathroom. **That** is where I shit But if you’re going to go for it, don’t really flirt, just make opportunities to hang out one on one and see if something develops... just tread lightly man	I’m going to go a little against the grain here and say, go for the throat. Be friendly, relaxed, and don’t make a big deal about it. But get the question out ASAP. I was in your exact situation, and this girl was a w e s o m e. So I didn’t want to spoil our friendship by going in too much. I took a few weeks of flirting with this friend and dropping hints before asking to take a step into a relationship. Some other guy beat me to the punch! So, while not throwing her off, get it done because the potential pain is worth the potential significant other.
What's the angriest you've been at your partner? Why? How did you act and how did you calm yourself down?	She supports NATOs actions in Ukriane. I got so pissed off i almost popped a vein. I stormed out and smoked half a pack of cigarettes. Was not a fun day.	My ex. If we got into an argument, he would literally just ignore me until I said whatever it was he wanted to hear. Or he would yell at me until I snapped and said whatever he wanted to hear. I was constantly crying out of frustration and exhaustion. Constantly. And he would get pissy about it. One day I was just so fed up with his shit that I just... shut down. I stopped crying in the middle of crying and yelling, and said very calmly, “I’m done. Get out.” He left. To this day, I can not stand it when somebody gives me the silent treatment. It will literally drive me up a wall. I’m not asking to talk about the argument or the problem, but I need to know that you’re okay.
Lesbians, what is your "creepy girl" story?	I’m a straight dude and I’ve had problems with creepy gay dudes...? It took only once before I understood how women feel about men creepin on them. My luck with women went up ten fold...	Not my story but my girlfriend... This girl pinned her to the wall super aggressively trying to kiss her. My girlfriend said no numerous times and was running away from her prior to the wall pinning. Girl just wouldn’t give up. All the while the girls boyfriend was watching... clearly unicorn hunters. My girlfriend had to yell at the boyfriend to get his girl off of her.
What is the worst case of over sharing you've seen on social media?	Like I'll gossip with my bff about your oversharing statuses but I really try to keep in mind that it's not hurting me just because Kathy is mentally ill and needs attention. Related: I am SUPER pleased that most of the comments here are about violating others' privacy, rather than your own. NEdit: Wow the Kathy comment makes me seem like a real dillweed, so let me just say I am mentally ill and need attention like all the time. I just use different methods than angsty facebook statuses as a general rule.	The saga of my friend's baby who was dealing with constipation. Her baby was extremely constipated for a week, which I am sure is stressful since the baby was crying constantly from discomfort, but she diligently documented the events on facebook. Then posted a picture of her **exploded diaper** when the baby finally got relief. D: WHY PARENTS. WHY SHARE POOP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. (have also seen 'poop or chocolate' pictures....)
Women of Reddit, what is your reaction to men who call themselves feminists?	Its a good thing. Apart from the ones who go "feminist, as long as you understand its about equality for everyone." Fuck them.	Their deeds and actions matter far more to me that whether or not they declare themselves a feminist. If they act like a feminist and treat women as equal and respected humans, then they are fine by me. If their actions don't match their feminist label, then I won't be particularly impressed by them.
My SO's "velvet" dick phenomenon... What are your other "sometimes my body just does that - no idea why" experiences?	Before people on here call that weird, I'll tell you that I know exactly what you're talking about and what it's from. Poontang is the ultimate wang moisturizer and I get "velvet dick skin" after sex, usually until the next time I shower.	Before people on here call that weird, I'll tell you that I know exactly what you're talking about. On some days my penis (especially the glans) just feels exceptionally smooth. I think it may have something to do with hydration.
Women who debated between having a large wedding and having a small, casual wedding, how did you eventually decide?	I’m unmarried but have attended a sufficient number of Indian weddings. 600 is small for us, so you need to specify your idea of small.	I looked at our budget 😂 But seriously, we had about 60 wedding guests and were able to spend quality time and talk to all of them. We had only people we currently talk to and are close with; no obligatory invites. It was the best and I have zero regrets.
What’s the stupidest thing someone has argued with you about?	I have always been the instigator of stupid arguments. I once argued about cultural appropriation with my mom as she doesn’t believe it’s a real thing that can be bad. I always feel bad when I remember that argument because it was kind of pointless. The problem is that I love debating so I have a hard time not arguing about stupid stuff sometimes. Also one time I argued with a girl I didn’t know well while I was on a long car trip with her about how Japanese people eating whales isn’t ok (she told me her grandmother eats whale) and she got pretty mad at me which made for an awkward rest of the trip... and I don’t know why I bothered arguing about that. I need to avoid talking about politics with people.	Arguing with a dude who said women should always get a small separate bed to sleep in when they are on period because they cannot sleep in main bed with their husband or boyfriend. Life wtf.
Men who are successful with online dating HOOKUPS, what does your dialogue look like?	I used to use a bot to message all the women on whatever site I was trolling for pussy. Then I'd set up meets with all the girls who were both local and could attract me. Maybe 3 or 4 would be honestly representing themselves rather than fat whales. 1 or 2 would be interested in a relationship or fucking and not just having me buy them stuff. Meh...I'm married to a young hottie now so I don't have to worry about it anymore.	Online hook ups are 90% looks, 10% sealing the deal. If you dont have the looks you'll have more success in real life.
Men, what’s the WORST thing a girl has said while having sex?	Daddy Yeah, unless you’re my kid or addressing me to my kid, stop that shit. It’s disgusting and not attractive at all.	As im slipping it in, her- “wait, you washed it since you pooped last,right?” , me- “what? Yes”, her- “but with antibacterial soap, right?”, me -“um, what... yeah sure”, her -“i dont believe you. Go wash in now and i need to smell it first. “
How has it been like for you living with overprotective parents?	As I look back, I’ve done well. No money, drug/alcohol, relationship problems. After being sheltered for 18 years I went to college then into law enforcement. I’ve seen a lot but kept my values to stay a good person. Some would say it sucks having overprotective parents but I appreciate it. I did not have a dysfunctional childhood like some people unfortunately do. So yeah as a teen it sucked getting my phone taken away or not being out late with boys but I’m living a good life thanks to them.	It led to a ton of anxiety as an adult. Lying became a survival skill as did my heightened senses. I can hear almost any noise at night, even when I’m sleeping. I can instantly feel when someone’s mood shifts and I will generally adapt to that shift. I ask “is anything wrong?” too frequently. Edit: guess I should clarify. This is not only for overprotective parents, this was also to survive abuse.
Men who have used steroids, what negatives have they had on your body? Were there any unexpected positives? And are they actually bad for you?	I've never done them myself, but I lived in a dorm with 2 guys that did. Roid rage is a real thing, and the amount of acne and bacne they had was insane. I highly recommend staying away from them	300 mg test and 300 mg tren a week. No negatives - slightly higher acne once you stop, but I'm also on accutane at the moment which keeps it all clear. Pros - gains come as long as you diet. Only thing is that if you let your ego go too hard (like some of my friends), you'll hurt something because your tendons dont develop as fast as your muscles
Ladies, what examples of sexism towards men do you notice?	As a man I don't really ever feel objectified. I want to say it's impossible, but that isn't accurate because maybe some other men have felt that way. I'd really love to hear from people about men being objectified as I've never experienced it.	One of the biggest ones I've seen in my line of work is the lack of male teachers and childcare workers due to sexism towards men. I've actually heard people say that any man who is interested in working with kids is probably a pedophile (WTF!). It's completely unfair to men and it's not a great thing for the children to experience, either. It also bothers me that there's so much pressure to be a super manly macho man. My boyfriend likes fashion and cooking, and plenty of people feel the need to question his sexuality or make him feel bad about himself. Screw that.
What are your thoughts on BoJack Horseman?	I watched about seven episodes. It was fucking stupid and I don't know why I kept watching for so long. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.	I am obsessed with Bojack Horseman. Stick it out through the first couple of episodes, trust me. I did not expect it to have such depth. The episode where Diane's dad dies (not really a spoiler) is when I really fell in love with this show. I'm not sure that Zeldas will like Bojack at all though. You might have to be a Zoe to really get it.
When was the last time you were truly happy?	Not a guy (sorry? ;) but I just wanna comment on this post. Probably one of the most "beautiful" questions I've read on Reddit so far. I know how often men can be neglected by people or society if they are truly happy or not. :) Sadly, I've never asked my father this question. But I think I probably knew the answer anyway. :) Wish all of you guys as happy as a clam ... :D	This is sick and twisted, I was in Iraq, we were constantly playing practical jokes on each other. I forget the joke or the series of jokes. I was laughing so hard I was crying, I forgot we were all in a big pile of suck we were just a bunch of friends having a good laugh. Life made sense. We were with people that we trusted, outside the wire were the people that hated us. At home, safe, were the people we all loved. Then I came home, and life went to shit. Edit: I hope you all don't mind, but I'm using this as a therapy session.
What are some things you do for safety reasons that most guys wouldn't think twice about?	If your post is going to be about the things men also do, about your experience as a man with this, keep in mind this is someone asking our community about things they do for safety reasons that they THINK most guys wouldn't think about. That doesn't make this an open challenge to point out every example you can under the sun. This is not a debate sub, this is an ask sub. People ask the community questions, the community answers. That's it. If you have an experience that is on topic but you find it contradicts someone else's, leave it as its own top level response instead of potentially derailing or invalidating another user.

Men of Reddit, what age did you discover that your dream career was not going to happen?	When I turned 6'6", not long after my sixteenth birthday, all my dreams were finally shattered. Still, science was a good second.	You know the funny thing? I have the technical skills to at least attempt my dream job. I just know it's stupid to and isn't worth it. (video game development) Compared to basically any other development job, you get over worked and under paid because of the absurd competition for "doing what you love" I knew going in that it was never going to be more than an idle dream. Especially with how flooded the market has become over the last few years with everyone and their mother thinking they'll make the next hit indie game in their basement and become millionaires.
Men, if your significant other had NO say, what would your wedding look like?	Me: "How much for the little girl? The women. How much for the women?" Edit: No Blues Brothers fans in here?? So much for Ask "Men"....	Somewhere super remote, like the Maldives. Invite everyone I've ever met, knowing that none will come but will feel obligated to send gifts.
How many of you deal with dark inner thighs and armpits? Any tips to lighten them?	I'm trying to picture this, and I'm not imagining anything that would turn me off, especially if I were already into someone enough that our clothes were off.	I had pretty dark armpits, and 90% of it went away after I went for IPL hair removal. For me, the dark tint on my skin was coming from the hair follicles that wouldn't go away when I was waxing/ shaving Edit: Changed laser hair removal to IPL
When was the last time you were really creeped out by someone?	Well, my male friend and I got catcalled by some girls who drove past us while we were walking on the sidewalk. They leaned out the windows, gestured with their arms and yelled something like "woohoo!" Obviously I didn't really mind, but it struck me that women complain about men behaving that way toward them and then they turn around and do it to us. Or at least these women did.	Weird guy at the gym always stares me down. Like every day this dude gives me death stares. We've only ever had one interaction, he asked me if I needed a spotter and I said I was good. That's it, now I have a creepy enemy.

What's a bad habit you're trying to break?	Masturbation. My religion believes it to be a sin, I feel guilty about doing it while in a serious relationship, and I would save a ton of money on lotion if I could stop. When I fail at quitting that, I'll try to break my habit of cussing, which I only do at work. GD the culture around these parts.	I have a bad habit of settling. I'll start learning something new or exercising more, then I'll just go "eh, good enough" and start to slack off
How do you deal with knowing that most people in your life don't really care about you?	Realizing that is both sad and liberating at the end of the day it's just you. Make mistakes, fuck up, learn, grow and become someone you like	They care a *bit*. You care a bit about the people around you, right? You'd get on with your day if you heard that the guy who checks out your groceries every week had died in a car accident, but you'd think it was a bad thing. Nobody's gonna care about you as much as you care about yourself - frankly, that being the case might be a bit unhealthy for the person in question. But that's okay. Your life is important to you, and that's enough to make it matter. When others care too, that's an extra, something more to appreciate.

Is anyone else kind of just... lost?	Join the military. Seriously. Just a couple of years. You get a whole other perspective on life. Sure, it can be dangerous but at least you'll have buddies and a mission.	Do you know what you want? Why compare your life to your married friend's if you don't want to be having a kid right now? You're not in a terrible place at 25. You're fit, sociable (as you can be), you're probably doing better than you think. I know you've said you've looked for a new job in the city, but maybe you can find one elsewhere? If it's the schedule or demands of this job that you think are the problem, see if you can find a more stable/consistent one where you are now. Outside of that, try to stop comparing. Life isn't a competition unless you want it to be. You can be happy for your friends while being in a different place. Take things at your own speed - besides, it's not like everyone who's married at your age has everything figured out either.
What ended up being a deal breaker in your relationship that you didn't think would bother you at the start?	The drugs, man. I thought it would be cool dating a chick that liked to party, but ye gods it got on top of her and nearly ruined me. Not to make blanket statements (well, here's one coming up), at least not to make blanket statements with negative intent, women cannot handle drugs. If your girl looks like she's getting hooked on something, dump her.	She talked a lot, which didn't bother me at first because I'm quiet, but that quickly turned into "Jesus fucking Christ does she ever shut up?"
Men who live alone, how do you discipline yourself to do household chores?	What's the problem? You live by yourself, you can do whatever you want. Cleaning up every now and again when you feel like it is perfectly fine.	I want to live in a decent home and that means that I have to keep it clean. That's all the motivation I need.
Girls, what makes you happy you're not a guy?	I wouldn't say I'd rather be a guy physically, but socially I think men have all the advantages. Except for being seen as more dangerous around kids and stuff. That's a drawback. But still, they automatically get people assuming they are strong and able to protect themselves and others.	Dealing with random boners in high school would have given me a nervous breakdown. I also really enjoy dresses and wearing fun eye shadow colour palettes. I am also very glad that I rarely have to stifle my emotions because of society's expectations. I enjoy having a good cry when a good cry is due. I find it very soothing and uplifting.
What's something everyone else on AW seems to enjoy, but you don't?	- Feminism, and all its related activism (or lack thereof) - Casual sex/promiscuous sex/polyamory/FWB/hook ups - Receiving oral sex - most aspects of pop culture marketed towards women (music, movies, tv shows that seem to be popular with the women around here...I don't care for them) - period sex - contrived political correctness - A vociferous child free stance despite still being in your reproductive years: look I get it, I was like that too, but most people won't truly believe you until you hit menopause.	Benedict Cumberbatch. He is not attractive to me at all. I know this might seem bad, he can't help the way he looks, but his face is kind of creepy looking. It has a lot points.
Does anyone here feel like they have a higher sex drive than their partner? How do you feel about it/how do you deal with it?	Not a female but a guy, he probably jerks off too much . Seriously if you do, you most likely won't a)want much sex b) be able to get a hard on to have sex.	One thing that no one is addressing that I'd like to is that an erection doesn't automatically equal wanting to have sex. That kind of attitude is the same one that leads people to believe men can't be raped by women and it's just really toxic in general. Boners can happen at inconvenient times, they can happen without a lot of horniness (or not happen when there is a lot of horniness), etc. Just try to ditch the whole attitude of boner = sex because it's not helpful to anyone and can even be harmful.
Whats the most embarrasing thing youve ever got away with hiding from everyone?	I regularly visit prostitutes. That in itself isn't such a big hoo-hah, but I deliberately only visit the very low-end ones, who are always surprised why a guy like me would go to them, because clearly I'm out of their league. The more obvious the difference in looks is, the better. I guess I like the feeling of being genuinely wanted, or at least I want a more genuine-looking illusion of it. If I went to some hot bimbo, she couldn't make me believe that she genuinely wants me, and I'd probably have a shitty time.	I peed my pants at work once. I had a bad, bad cold, and started coughing really badly. I made it to the rest room, but one final cough was the last straw... I peed. And in pants that really, really showed it. There was no way to hide it. After a minute or two of panic, I turned on the sink and splashed water ALL OVER the front of me, totally soaking myself from bosom to knees. Then I ran out of the bathroom yelling that the faucet had sprayed me when I turned it on. My boss apologized, called a plumber to look at the faucet, and I got to go home early because I was wet and uncomfortable.
Do you think it's necessary to wash your hands after you pee at home?	Yep. I don't see why being at home would make a difference. Do you touch your genitals or wipe yourself? Wash your damn hands. Do you flush the toilet? Wash your damn hands. Do you touch doorknobs? Wash your damn hands. Seriously just wash your hands. I can't believe this is getting asked here again. So gross.	I do. But realisticly, my phone is probably a thousand times more dirty than my hands after touching some toilet paper. So I do it, because it is ingrained and a good way to wash your hands a bunch of time every day, but I guess you could technically also make it part of another routine. I won't change my ways, but I think that washing my hands before I prepare food makes more sense.
How is/was dating after college?	It's fucking horrible, man. I suggest you lock a college girl down now because after college you'll be wading through garbage just to find a girl without children, drug addictions, or facial piercings/excessive tattoos.	As a single college student who just broke up with his first girlfriend and graduating in 3 months, these replies are fucking depressing.
What is the most hurtful thing your SO could say to you without realizing it?	"I like you because of your personality, not because you are a man." That one right there makes me sick. Never had an SO, but if this happened I would be upright offended for the first time in my life. Why would anyone want to be with me if they didn't like my body or my gender? I sure as hell hope that this never happends.	Held a woman in my arms while she died one time. Two weeks later we were with some friends and they were asking about it. As i was telling them about it my ex said "Don't leave out the part where you cried like a little bitch." I left her very shortly after.
Drinkers of AskMen -- What's your #1 sign that you've reached the point of being drunk?	When I know I can't walk unless I wait a little bit, I stop drinking. Usually that's 6 double tall crown and cokes in two hours, with 2 Redd's up front.	My "tell" is letting out a huge exhale with my lips pursed and cheeks puffed. I have no clue why I do this, and I do this without thinking when I get drunk; when I recognize it, it's my sign to slow down before I say stupid things like "moving around is fun!" in public again.
New SO doesn't cum from sex, is this normal?	Lol to all the people saying this is "normal". I can't attest to the "deathgrip" stuff people are saying, but his behavior and how he handles it is not normal. It's completely socially awkward and you should just sit down with him and tell him what you want from sex and what he wants from it.	I'm actually 31 and exactly the same as this guy. I enjoy sex and blow jobs, but I have to use my hand to finish most of the time. I can cum from sex, but it takes like 30 minutes of pounding without a condom to get me there. >Are you really going to masturbate when there is a girl who wants to have sex with you in your bed? I personally wouldn't masturbate in bed next to my partner, I would more likely go do it in the bathroom or something. But unless you made it clear you wanted to have sex right then I wouldn't assume you did either.
Men of Reddit, what are your biggest frustrations with women who are in their 20s?	Just the vapid idiocy. I mean, I was probably the same way, but I'm tired of being told how the world works by someone who's barely an adult and is still sheltered enough that they can afford to die their hair pink.	How a lot of women just... dont do anything. How am I supposed to establish connection with you when your interests are Netflix, Instagram, and drinks with friends?
Guys who don't chase after women and let them chase you. How has that been working for you and what is your strategy behind it?	There is no strategy behind it. You only need a strategy if you're chasing something. Also, if you don't chase anybody, there's higher chance somebody will start chasing you.	I don’t chase women, but I don’t make them chase me. The effort you put in should probably be equal or close to equal.
How much do you REALLY drink?	When I'm traveling for work? 2 ciders and a cocktail at least per night. Sometimes way more, usually tons of pre-gaming with vodka. It's how we cope with the shitty work we have to do. On an average week? One drink, tops. I'd rather have soda.	Wow this thread makes me feel like an alcoholic. I usually have a drink most nights with dinner, usually wine but sometimes beer. On weekends I have 2-4 drinks per night. Type of alcohol varies depending on my mood and context. I should probably drink less.
Women, who did date the "nice guy", what happened?	All of mine ex's are "the nice guy". My current boyfriend is the poster boy for "nice guy" and "friend zone". As much as I like the whole "bad boy" image, I'm also not stupid.	I went out with him twice and if I didn't do everything he wanted exactly like he wanted he pitched a fit like a spoiled toddler. Only this spoiled toddler was 6'2 and 30 years old. His anger was much more dangerous.
I hear a lot about women who never have experienced an orgasm during sex. Are there any men out there with the same issue?	I think you just need the right girl and to feel relaxed. Find one who can have vaginal orgasms fairly easily. She'll be well lubrucated and the fact that she's very obviously getting hers will boost majorly your confidence.	Happened to me the first 4 or 5 times me and my ex had sex. Fun for a while because I could just go until she finished. Eventually the more comfortable I became with her and our sex life I started finishing consistently
Guys, what is your degree and how much money do you make anually?	High school. 50k. Sauce boss. I make sauces and salad dressings. Plan on going back to school, and or pursuing photography more seriously.	Majored in business ethics. I am a male stripper. $55k, but its a cash business so if you are the IRS $40k. Thank god for wealthy cougars.
Mothers of AW, have you ever teamed up with your child to play a prank on your SO? What was the prank?	I was the child. My mum came across her boyfriend's car and decided it would be funny to write "you smell of poo" on one of the windows using lipstick. It was so funny I couldn't help but tell him who did it as soon as we next saw him.	Last year she wanted to do something for April Fool's, so we smeared the toilet seat with Vaseline. She was only 7yo and couldn't stop giggling, so of course, he saw it.
What weirdly specific thing makes you sad or emotional?	Children laughing makes me cry because it sounds so delightful, pure and beautiful. Later on in life, they might not find joy in the smallest things or they will be too stressed out or whatever.	Scenes in movies where an animal loves and trusts a person, but is in danger so the person has to shoo them away or set them free and the animal is like "but we're friends" and can't understand why the person doesn't like them anymore. This situation may have happened in Dances with Wolves or maybe I just constructed that in my mind. Also it happened in Air Bud.
Ladies, what kind of moments make you look at your SO and say to yourself “Damn, this one is a keeper”?	Today was an unexpected snow day. Neither of us knew it was coming. I took the dogs out for their wake up and go. Snow is an event here and an unexpected snow means staying off the road. So I popped on some baby foot booties. He got curious why I was waking like a demented baby giraffe. I had another pair so he decides he’s gotta try them. Watching him take the dogs out to poop while wearing slimy socks under socks in my slides bc I did the first take the dogs out in the snow was so unbelievably hilarious. They pooped when he took them out. When I took them out it was maybe 45 seconds. He wasn’t even mad when he came back inside. He knew it was hilarious to watch.	We've been together for nearly 20 years. He's watched me grow and change over time. No one on the planet knows me the way he does. He's kind, supportive, and loves even when I don't feel at my best. I just sat down with him and he offered me part of his pizza. That's love.
What is it about dating/relationships that hasn't already been answered in at least 1000 previous threads would you like to ask in here?	What kind of dogfood would make for the most romantic third date dressed in dogsuits to show you're equally committed in sharing her love of dogs?	How in the hell are you supposed to find a dominant woman? Every woman I have met was submissive. I want someone who will be my big spoon, figuratively and literally.
What should a young guy who hasn’t thrown a BBQ party himself know about throwing one?	Get your smoker to a nice 200 before throwing the pig on. Keep that baby nice and low for at least 12 hours	Provide side dishes or ask guests to bring them. Also get extra burger and dogs just in case, it’s better to have leftovers than not enough. Provide a good variety of drinks (water, Soda,beer) and LOTS of ice.
Women who ended long-term relationships with generally supportive partners who are not abusive: what ultimately convinced you to end the relationship? Was it the right decision?	For those reading the top-level comments in this thread: this is not the place to come and judge people for their reasons for ending relationships. No one has an obligation to remain in a relationship they're unhappy with, period. Everyone: please continue to report any rule-breaking comments as you see them.

Men of reddit, what surprising or disgusting things have you had to do when you started living with your SO?	same same story. was not pumped for that but really its not all that big a deal after i realized i was being childish. man im commited to this person im active with said person on so many levels why do i need to be freaked out by this. sure i dnt care much for blood but i love the person more then i hate blood. its also a natural normal function.not some icky tale that media drives into ones brain.	The things you see while doing laundry before and after pregnancy; also heavy periods. I know what is happening down there, don't care. I just turn the machine on and forget about it.
What are some social aspects of being a woman that men will never understand?	Thanks everyone. Apparently one thing that fits the post is "answering the question without a bunch of men coming in and telling women how they are actually wrong." If you had a comment removed, it was because of either derailing or invalidation. Don't do it in the future.	Thanks everyone.

What’s the furthest you’ve ever drunk teleported?	Yep! I was at a party and wanted food, 'teleportred' a full car (full of people) to Wendy's and I was ordering food. I then 'teleported' us all back to the living room to eat our food. Twas a wonderful venture.	30 meters from my house, 33km from where i blacked out. Looks like i tried to drunk-stumble home but ended up in the gutter by my neighbour's house. So close yet so far.
What is that obscure (or not) topic you know a lot about but don't talk about because no one has ever brought it up or asked about it? What are you DYING to tell someone?	Every other person I meet is happy to talk about old Nintendo games, but no one ever wants to talk about old Sega games with me.	I know a lot about Latin. I'm extremely proficient (I don't say fluent because Latin is read/written and not really spoken) because I have studied it since I was 13 plus all through college. I do some now in my spare time, just translations and such. I have a lot of books. I know all of the grammar. I see a lot of words with Latin roots and I think about Latin on a daily basis but I keep it to myself because bringing it up sounds really pretentious and most people find it boring. Oh, and NOBODY brings up Latin. But I'll have you know that the second that someone does (happens, I don't know, maybe a few times a year), my ears will prick up and I will run over and knock over people to contribute.
How can I get my girl friend to stop treating me like a girlfriend?	You're her emotional tampon. She's using you as a sponge so she can vent, but I'm willing to bet that she does absolutely nothing for you. Edit: Typo	Stop enabling it. If you don't want to be her source of comfort, then stop doing it every time she goes to you for it. Understand though, however you do this whether you just get colder or you tell her to stop doing this, this will probably cause rifts in your friendship. She's going to you because that's the kind of friend she sees you as. You're essentially telling her that that's not what you are, and she'll be understandably confused or upset about it because that is what you were telling her the kind of friend you were through your actions.
Have your cramps ever been so bad that while your phone is warm and charging, you put it on your abdomen and use it as a makeshift heating pad because you can't get out of bed to get a real one?	I use my boyfriend's hand on my abdomen. He has really warm hands, so if we're out somewhere talking and I get bad cramps I'll grab his hand and put it there, or if he sees my face in pain he'll put it there. He's a real sweetie.	That's a good idea. If you have a cat...keep treats by the bed. If they are like mine, the minute you open the package you'll have two furry mobile heating pads at your disposal.
Would you date a woman who posted naked pictures of herself on the internet?	This thread sucks, you'll use their service, but don't respect them for doing it. How is this not wrong. It's a job, just like any job it can fuck with you. It doesn't turn every sex worker into some shady self loathing narcissist. I would and have dated sex workers. It's about who they are, not where they work.	Before we were in the relationship, I probably wouldn't mind. During the relationship I'd probably have a problem with it.
Asian men, what are your thoughts on the stereotypes and portrayal of Asian men in the media?	I'm Polish, so I am about as qualified to be culturally-sensitive about this subject as I am to fly a space shuttle, but whatevs: I honestly don't think they have it that bad. Sure there's not a lot of them and they're rarely the protagonists, but when I think "Asian guy in a movie" what comes to mind is "competent, stoic, honuorable, humble badass". Though I probably should disclose that I watch more Asian movies than dumb American comedies.	It's pretty shitty, but I'm hardly surprised. We're a huge minority in the west, so I wouldn't really expect media to cater to us, but it doesn't help us when Asian men are usually portrayed as some combination of small, quiet, shy, nerdy, bookish, small-penised, sidekick, foreign, and effeminate. It certainly affects how people view us when these stereotypes are perpetuated in the media we consume. As a population, we're typically neutered in media; how often do you see an Asian male character get laid in movies that isn't some kind of joke a la Sixteen Candles?
What are some of the downsides/meh aspects of long-term relationships?	The realization that you've given them all the best years of your life and gotten next to nothing in return.	I wouldn't say it's a downside, so much as a reality: if you're together long enough, at some point one or both of you will face hardships (e.g.: job loss, illness, grieving, stressful situations, etc.) that may impact the relationship and where you require the other's support. It's something people may not be prepared, willing or able to deal with. It's easy to enjoy the good times and look forward to the happy times ahead, and you should, but the reality is that life throws you curveballs and if you're in a LTR the curveballs life throws at your partner may impact you as well and vice versa. How you two get through those curveballs helps shape your relationship and can ultimately strengthen it, but you do have to be prepared and willing to work through and ride out those difficult times.
Lesbians: how do you feel about straight ladies at gay bars?	I dunno, the last time I was at a gay bar, it was as part of a bachelorette party for a straight lady. And it was the one club I went to during that bachelorette party where I could dance sexy with my girlfriend without getting all grabbed at by straight boys. As long as you do what I do in straight bars (have fun without acting as if you're attracted to people you're not attracted to, and turn them down politely, and don't treat other bargoers as if they are entertainment for you) I don't see the issue.	I'm a bisexual and feel kind of uncomfortable going because I feel like I will be evaluated as not gay enough.
For all my office working ladies, what is in your "survival pack" at work?	**In my desk:** makeup bag, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouth wash, deodorant, manicure set, bobby pins, hair ties, brush, comb, full change of clothes, granola bars, soup, nuts, jerky, tea, condiments, umbrella, phone charging cord, ear buds, mirror. **My office provides:** Advil, Aleve, Tums, band-aids, neosporin, tissues, hand sanitizer, tampons, pads, and hand lotion.	- Tampons - Toothbrush and toothpaste - Copious amounts of tea - Deodorant - Painkillers - Hand sanitizer - Moisturizer - Allergy pills - Tums - Kleenex
Would you date someone who hates curse words?	Fuck that noise. Swear words are just words, words. If you get offended by just mere words then fuck yoouuuu	> P.S. Let's say all curse words, starting from ass and damn. Nah, someone like that's too uptight for me to date.
Approached by a female coworker asking if I was free Saturday evening and I don't want to meet up, except I've already said okay. What is the best excuse to get out of it?	Re: edit #1. No, you don't need excuses. Get off the couch. Honor your commitments. Don't be shitty. Go interact with people.	> EDIT2: I have a girlfriend and it just hasn't come up in conversation. This German coworker is only here for a few months, and she has a boyfriend in Germany. I really need a good excuse to get out of it and not look like I'm slingin dick. Say you're sorry to cancel with such short notice but your GF surprised you with dinner reservations for Saturday Or, you know, you could just tell the truth
Men, what would you cook for your date?	Idk how to cook, and women have been statistically terrible to me, so I wouldn't want to cook for them anyway.	Oh hey meal requests yeah I can do this > I'll probably make a brocolli purée with goat cheese and walnuts Well shit you're outta my league
Poor, broke, and down on your luck ladies, what are some things financially stable people say that annoy you?	If you're complaining about how broke you are, I know you're doing better than I am. I'll sit there, listen & nod, "oh yeah, that's tough," but I'm conserving my energy for surviving. Getting angry at the people in my life who having no concept of value just fills me with hatefulness. I have enough problems without that emotional stress. When you're drinking extra water to keep the hunger pains down, you don't talk about that shit. You don't want anyone to know. My new hatefulness/financial stress buster is singing a song called "knocking on wood" by Spose. Gotta choose between paying the bills and having grocery money again? Rock out, loudly.	I make a decent living but it still bothers me when people make assumptions about others' finances, like "Oh it's only $5, everyone can afford that." No. Not everyone can afford that. It also *really* bothers me when other people make decisions with my money. "I bought this spa weekend. I figured we'd all go and chip in $50." It may only be $50 but it's my money, not yours to spend. My family does this to me all the time.
Have you ever had a girl insist on being "one of the guys" only to be repulsed when you treated her as as one?	I just don't like hanging out with girls. I'd rather watch you guys play Portal for three hours in silence than talk about keloid scars from c-sections and kid's bowel movements.	Repulsed no, been completely offended, cried and one of my friends gets told what a jerk he is because he gave her some shit, yes. Why would you want to hang out with us when half of our jokes are about how we're fat, stupid and going to end up alone forever? It's like the woman's greatest hits of things to make her cry.
What changes moved you from living paycheck to paycheck to being financially comfortable?	Shopping smarter - make a menu, make a shopping list and stick to it. We buy meat directly from a local processor. It's much cheaper, the meat is better, fresher, and not pumped full of steroids, antibiotics and God knows what. No credit cards. But whatif....NO CREDIT CARDS!	Getting divorced and no longer having to support my husband. I know it sounds flip, but it's true - spouses are hella expensive!
What is the dumbest thing you've seen your pet do (and not get harmed)?	[My hedgehog Boots] (https://instagram.com/p/BHy1XicBZAk/) loves to do stupid stuff (like she's doing in her picture! But the weirdest is when she climbs on the roof of her cage upside down. Idk how she does it but then she falls off and just keeps going. What a dork!	A couple of days ago, my idiot cat swallowed a live bumblebee. If she'd even whimpered, I'd have taken her to the vet, but no sign of distress. Just now she outdid herself by jumping onto the lit BBQ. Thank goodness I had closed it a minute before.
Any other verbally needy ladies out there?	I actually get annoyed if a gf is fishing for compliments. It sounds like the only reason you pretty yourself up is that you give your boyfriend reason to massage your ego. >The most I ever get is 'pretty', and frankly it's just left me feeling like crap and like he doesn't think I'm sexy or beautiful. Just...pretty. I actually have to roll my eyes here. I mean a compliment is apparently not even enough. You have apparently something specific in mind and want to hear precisely that and "pretty" just doesn't cut it. Yes, it's nice when the SO says something affectionate, but as soon as you expect it it looses all merit and would really put me off to say something, because I know now I HAVE to say something nice. Compliments should be offered not requested. That's not how compliments work.	Yes. I'm not someone who needs a lot of validation from other people but it's very important I get it from my SO. He's horrible at it though.
What (trivial) knowledge might save your life one day?	If a French person asks if you want a tattoo on your body, say no. Armadillos can carry leprosy, and you should never underestimate an undomesticated animal.	If you feel like you are having a heart attack and decide to take aspirin, you **must** chew the aspirin for it to be effective.
What are conversations that every couple should have?	Two big ones for me are finances and long-term goals. Good to know if those align with what you are planning in general.	Well, I found this out last night... Apparently you have to clarify that you are in fact one another's SO's. We'd been seeing each other for a couple of months, I being a simple man, assumed that we just were a couple. Thats a lot easier than actually asking her to be my girlfriend. I always assumed that once we were always together, friends had met one another, we clicked she just became my girlfriend, and I her boyfriend. We had this convo last night and I guess we are only now officially boyfriend and girlfriend. Little does she know, she's been my girlfriend for like 2 months.
Ladies, what’s your experience with getting a bikini wax?	Your significant other should do it. Free of charge minus the wax and those canvas paper sheet things and that lotion stuff. I'm just saying if their usually down their anyway. Best to make sure their not a one trick pony put him to work.It's just one more choir. You wouldn't pay to have your trash taken out(literally or a light bulb changed? Then again it is the 21st century. Maybe the lady at the STD clinic will throw it in when you buy a panel test?	It hurts but not as much as you think it will. It's fairly awkward making small talk with a woman you've just met staring at your vagina. I totally grudge paying money for pain.
Have any of you seen '13 Reasons Why' on Netflix? What did you think of it?	Clay deserved to be on those tapes tbh. He did fuck all when he should have stepped in, be marginally more supportive, and then tried to make up for it in the worst ways possible.	It was amazing. I binged it all in a day and a half. I felt so raw afterwards. Most well-made Beats by Dre commercial yet.
Dating rule: "Who cares least wins." How did we get here?	It has nothing to do with what you're talking about. Basically what it means is don't invest everything into a single date that'll leave you devastated if it doesn't work out. Statistically these things don't work out more than they do. So when you're banking on it and subsequently placing giant expectations on something that's supposed to be casual, you're setting yourself up for failure. None of that means don't put any effort into a date, just don't expect anything from it. Edit: I think where the problem lies is that, judging on the men who post here, guys don't come across these opportunities often. So when they get them they put this overwhelming amount of pressure on themselves and the date to succeed, because who knows when they'll get this opportunity again?	"Who cares least wins" is just a way of expressing how a power dynamic that is common in many types of relationships is also part of romantic relationships. For example, imagine you own a company which sells almost all of its products to wal-mart, and wal-mart wants to change the terms of your contract. In this little scenario, wal-mart doesn't care much about your business at all, but you care about wal-mart's business because it is super critical to your company's survival. When you negotiate, wal-mart has all the power because wal-mart barely cares what happens. It is not advice to try to be an unfeeling robot, but a warning that if your partner doesn't really care about the relationship, your partner is the one with the power to dictate what happens.
Women of reddit, what are the best surprises a partner has done for you that also didn't cost a lot?	I’ll never forget the day my SO brought me home a mocha frappe with extra caramel drizzle. Except I don’t like mocha. I hate everything mocha/chocolate flavored and love the caramel frappe but he’d gotten confused and order the mocha by mistake and I let him have it but I was so touched by the sweet gesture. My love language is gifts and it’s centered around the thought of the gift so I’m equally stunned by someone bringing me a $1 candy and someone buying me a $700 piece of tech. I love when people stop and think I’d like this thing, so they bring it to me unprompted. It’s hands down the sweetest gesture in the world to me and the fact that I don’t drink mocha drinks just made the whole thing cute.	Coming home to a meal already cooked is always great. Doesn't even have to be a fancy meal, just whatever we were going to eat anyway.
People who found their "calling" or "passion" late, how did you find it and what do you do?	Never understood why everyone 'needs' to have a passion or calling, it sounds really individualistic. A job isn't meant to be fun, its an exchange between your time and money. I feel passions are what you spend with the money outside of work, and only some lucky people get to live with both living and working their passion. Truth is you don't need a passion, you are not obligated to find something you like to do because if nothing clicks its just a bunch of wasted pressure thrown at you to make a good income while being ecstatic to go to work every morning. I know the economy is getting harder in terms of living a comfortable life with non-skilled jobs and this is creating the pressure to find a calling but its all for the wrong reasons.	My Dad worked in real estate for 30+ years and recently quit to become a substance abuse counselor. Totally different field, but he went through all the training and got certified and is now working a job he loves at a major hospital. Oh, and he'll be 70 in April. It's really never too late. Reminds me of that quote that's always on Reddit: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now".
What's the most insensitive thing you asked an adult as a kid?	My daughter is amazing at saying awkward stuff. She's five. Just last week I was picking her up from school. She has been asking a ton of questions about the equality movement ever since they studied Martin Luther King Jr. Her best friend is also the only black kid in the entire school. So a week ago, she hugged her friend goodbye and as we walked away, we passed her friend's mom making her way towards the school pushing a stroller with her friend's baby brother in it. My daughter turned to me and loudly said "BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BLACK BABIES!" Nice...	Thank god I just asked my parents, but when I was about five my cat got neutered and I asked them why our neighbors (6 or 7 kids) couldn't do the same thing.
What are the most common misconceptions that men have about how women experience sex?	This is a good post, but I honestly feel that most men on this subreddit are probably already aware of most of if not all of these bits of information. That being said, still good to hear again.	I always find it funny when I come across a guy who legit thinks that women don't enjoy sex and use it for manipulating men. My automatic conclusion there is that he's horrible in bed, ha.
OK lofty ladies, it's our turn. What height-related problems do your shorter friends never understand?	I'm just going to go on record and say I love tall girls. #1 most attractive feature to me. So all you tall ladies keep being you; you're beautiful.	PANTS. Please don't complain to me about not being able to find pants when you're short. Every department store has a petite section. You can hem pants. You can't make them longer. I have maybe one pair of pants that actually fits properly. I wear skirts most of the time, and ankle pants in the summer or covered with boots in the winter.
How do I avoid "girlfriend-zoning" my female friends?	Eh... Here is some old dude advice. Guys don't have girl...friends. They have potential sexual partners. You are no different than any other guy. You are friendlier to certain girls because that is what we do. The problem isn't "girlfriend zoning" whatever the f'k that is. The problem is that you cant close the deal. Your question is probably more like...how do I get girls that I like to have sex with me. That is the question all guys have. Edit: here comes the your-opinion-sucks brigade. The difference between us is that I don't have pretenses	That never goes away buddy. Just learn to respect boundaries. Dont get drunk and have sex with them. Dont touch them inappropriately or make jokes about yall hooking up. Its about establishing boundaries and respecting your female friends enough not to cross those boundaries. This is never going away, so start establishing these expectations now and in a few years you will be a pro at it. Plus, these women will respect the absolute fuck out of you because most men do not follow these boundaries and disrespect them by crossing over them. Its just part of life for women. So dont add to the bullshit they have to deal with.
As a male, nearly all of my closest friends are female. While it's not an issue, I'm the only guy I know who almost exclusively has female friends. How normal is this?	Ive only ever seen this with gay men because they fear they won't be able to fit in with men as friends because they'll be made fun of. This was particularly evident in high school and the women are more accepting and understanding. I personally, in my late 20's don't have and never had a single woman 'friend'. Everyone I know is like this too. The only time I pay attention to a woman is a) If I have too or b) If I like them. For these women you are 'friends' with. How many would you sleep with?	My closest friends are all female. One I thought was male and then she came out as trans. ... traitor. I love her tho EDIT: Should probably clarify that I mean I met her as a "John" and now she goes by "Jane".
When did you realize you were dating an idiot?	This is finally a thread to which I have the perfect story. Keep in mind this girl was a relatively new driver, maybe a month in. I dated her in high school. She asked me while driving us somewhere how to roll down the windows in the car. About fourty five minutes later she said she needed to get gas and asked how to do it. I broke up with her that night. Edit: apparently it's normal to grow up around cars and not know how to operate the windows. Additionally it is totally normal that after thirty days or more into driving a car every day, a smart human still hasn't learned to work the gas tank or the BUTTON to roll a window down.	Not me, but the poor sod in the row in front of me at the cinema. After our showing of Inglorious Basterds, the girlfriend was getting out of her seat and said to her assumed boyfriend - “It’s amazing that that’s how Hitler actually died like” To which the boyfriend, sort of sadly, replied, - “Babe... we’ve talked about the TV thing” Leading me to believe that this is a running problem.
Women who moved to another country for love, how did it turn out?	A story from a friend of mine. Men will dislike it I guess. Basically she married this dude she found online or something like that, he is from the US, moved with him, lived with him several years, then got a greencard and divorced him. Now she has a US citizenship, she moved her parents to the US, is married and has a kid with a European dude so her child has two most powerful citizenships. Smart lady.	He dumped me and I found myself alone in a foreign country. My nearest family was hours away, and my entire friend circle was through him. I was completely on my own, no family, no friends, nowhere to live.
What is it about that "one guy" in your friend group that you can't stand?	Nice Guy syndrome. 'Poor people should just work harder' even though when his parents cut him off he depended on everyone else for food, housing, and transportation to survive university. 'The woman in Rum Diaries deserved to get raped because that's what happens when white women hang around blacks'. 'The woman in Irreversible deserved to get raped because she didn't listen to her boyfriend.' Just a general lack of self awareness and social skills. Love the guy though.	He was a good friend of a guy I consider one of my best friends. They'd been friends since elementary school. I always thought he was a douchebag, and didn't give a rats ass about anyone but himself. Well, my best friend's wife walked out on him for reasons that boiled down to her not being happy. Best friend told old school friend to stay away from her for a while, hoping that she'd come back. Turns out old school friend was after her from before she left. Last I knew they were shacking up together. If I came across them burning in a car fire, I wouldn't so much as drink a beer to work up enough piss to urinate on them to put them out.

What do you think straight porn would look like if it catered only to female pleasure?	It already exists under the title 'Feminist Porn' it's a lot more genuine and focuses on making the woman orgasm not just make a bunch of moaning noises for the camera.	A lot more cunnilingus that actually brings the woman to orgasm, unlike few second licks like in porn. Female centered penetration, instead of male centered one that dominates porn currently. This is grinding while penetration, not just in and out.
I'm tired of all the relationship questions on askmen. What type of music do you guys like? What song have you been listening to on repeat lately?	I've been listening to a playlist made of albums from Coheed & Cambria, Blink 182, 1989 by Taylor Swift, MMLP2, The BTVS Once More With Feeling soundtrack, the Frozen soundtrack, Jimi Hindrix Greatest Hits, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Panic!, Royal Blood, and Meghan Trainer. My goto song right now is Sentry The Defian by Coheed. Second would be Random Reality Shifts, by Coheed. And then Castles Made of Sand by Hendrix.	Right now, I really like Die Antwoord, Parkway drive, Iron maiden, A LOT of classical music, Led Zeppelin, and some Kendrick Lamar. I try to listen to a lot of different music. I want get into music from around the world, in other languages besides English and Spanish. Die Antwoord and Sigur Ros are my first artists in this aspect.
What's the best way to use Tinder?	i've just started dating a guy i met off tinder. previously used it just for hook-ups. its whatever you want it to be really. i ignored all pick-up lines but some guys say they work for them so i dunno. pictures where you look hot are typically the best.	Group pictures where one cannot tell which one is you ARE THE WORST. Also posing next to an attractive friend. It's pretty bad when you swipe right for the friend... awkward. Try and talk to them, but not too much - actually make plans to meet and have that organic connection in person. Also, know what you want and stick to it. Hookup? Great! Not hookup? Great! If you're just seeing where things go, great, but don't lead people on. That's not nice. Just be clear and communicate that to the other person.
You just won the lottery and never have to work again, but you're bored and want to. What job do you do or business do you start?	Puppy, hedgehog and bear breeder. That or I'd invest it all in the research to bring back dinos. Buy and island and build a lab there	A bar where I'm shitfaced all the time and belligerent to the other patrons But SUPER cheap drinks so people always come
Bachelors, what is your go to meat you cook often and how do you prepare it?	Instead of meat, try some grilled veggies. Slice squash, zuchinni, carrots, or any vegetable of the like in 1/4" slabs. Throw in a skillet with chili oil, sliced onions and garlic. Serve on toasted sandwich bun!	I buy boneless skinless chicken breasts in bulk, 40lb box for $45 at restaurant depot. Preheat oven to 400 degrees, rub chicken in olive oil and season with salt and pepper. I'll do other seasonings if i'm getting tired of salt and papper. 10 minutes in, flip, 15 minutes on the other side and check for internal temperature of 163-165 It's easy and cheap. I'll throw some asparagus in the oven too on some days, or toss it in a salad other days.
Were you a bigger fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon or Zoo Tycoon? Why?	I don't think I could choose between the two. I was a huge fan of both. Making death roller coasters and releasing the lions on the zoo....what isn't to love about those games?	Roller Coaster Tycoon, definitely. I liked making people fall to their deaths. Besides, an amusement park is waaaay more fun to visit.
Women who accidentally got pregnant, how did birth control go wrong?	First time it was a batch of recalled birth control, 2nd time I had the flu and apparently if you throw up your birth control it doesn't work... ;) I wouldn't change either for anything though.	Not me, but my sister got pregnant with an IUD perfectly in place. They didn't find any defects, it hadn't moved at all, the doctor said she was just "the 1%".
Are white lies okay in your relationship or do you expect complete transparency?	I would want complete honesty. My SO likes to tell me white lies. And I catch him on it. It drives me insane. I'm not upset but it's annoying. Because we have to have the conversation all over again. Just tell me the truth from the beginning.	Meh. I'm fine with lies about gifts, surprises, or how yummy the meal you prepared wasn't. But even beyond that, I don't expect complete *transparency*. Honesty is fine, but I don't need to know *everything*. I just need to have what you do want to tell me be true.
Openly bi/lesbian ladies, how old were you when you came to terms with yourself and what made you realize?	Despite intimations from a very young age, it wasn't until my teens I realized I was bi after crushing on and fooling around with folks of both genders. In college I realized I was trans after learning the miraculous new word "transgender" (the 20th century was a dark and ignorant era for us). It wasn't until my 30s, after a series of fucked up relationships with dudes, that I decided to give up on men altogether and live happily ever after as a lesbian.	Seventeen. Finally realized why I'd watched *all* of Shakira's music videos, and that the "admiration" I had felt for a couple girls since the beginning of high school was more like a crush.
What has been your worst “This dude/gal is clueless” moment so far?	My husband thought that he could reveal all my sexual secrets to his family and colleagues and my family all the while painting me as hard work dramaqueen who provoked episodes of biting and beating to which I owned up for him.	I had to train one of my teenage students that it was not ok to open mouth cough on his classmates, and that it was not a good idea to blow his nose into his hand. When he asked for a tissue, I knew I had succeeded. His desk mate thanked me after a very rough winter. Kid was 14 and had no learning difficulties. He was jus clueless.
Women who've taken a partner's last name when that name doesn't match your own culture/ethnicity: What has been your experience with your new name? Have you ever regretted taking it?	Kinda funny. My name is Welch - but I’m Asian. So for a long time my name didn’t match my Asian last name. And when I got married my husband had a very regal British last name, which now suited my first name - and apparently sounds quite common over in the U.K. lol. At any rate - even if we divorce I don’t regret taking the name since now it actually fits my first name despite outwardly not looking the part at all. I’d probably keep the name even after divorce.	My married last name is Hispanic. I got asked, "how did a white girl like you get a last name like that?" I really wished I could have answered them in perfect Spanish but alas I took German in high school. So I just said I got it from my husband.
I just messaged my ex on facebook. What is the stupidest thing you have done lately?	First break up I spent 6 months crying over her. Second break up I realized I didn't want to do that. So the day we broke up I hit on some girls downtown and got laid that night. The following weeks I met a new girl each week, each more amazing than the last. Choose	I didn't delete my porn folder or search history whilst my computer was breaking but still usable. Now my friend is coming over to fix it and I'll have to spend the whole time looking over his shoulder.
What's making you unhappy in your current relationship?	Our baby is 5 months old. Our sex life is non existent. My vagina still hurts terribly and it's making me unhappy. My clitoris tore as well, so it's been quite a ride... Lack of sleep makes me angry and we both are stressed out and snap easily, but we are working on it. I never thought having a baby would be this hard.	Only that my husband is very unhappy and stressed at work and I hate seeing him so deflated and upset. I know that I can cheer him up short-term by cooking him his favourite food, cuddling him and listening to him talk, but the fact that I can't do more makes me sad.
Asian women of Reddit, what are your thoughts on the media stereotypes and portrayals of Asian women?	My girlfriend is Vietnamese. Some of the comments I receive from other men are downright disrespectful. That’s my girlfriend man!	Ethnics outside of Chinese and Japanese are virtually nonexistent. Koreans are making more of an appearance. Asians are either half white or looks... very Asian? I’m Asian American and I feel like I don’t look like the Asian women I see on the screen. I don’t look like Olivia Munn or Zhang Ziyi. Brenda Song is probably the closest representation but even we don’t look anything alike.
Ladies of Reddit, how do you deal with depression?	I hit the bar and return home with the tallest, most buffed guy I can find. Works charms for selfsteem. God, men are easy	I was lucky enough to find someone who accepts me completely and encouraged me to go to therapy. He was also the one to clarify that I'm not crazy, playing the victim or just stupid.
Ladies, what's your favourite book that you feel like nobody else has read?	Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. It seems like everyone should read that but I've only met 3 or 4 IRL who have. Everyone and their mother read 1984 but Huxley's dystopian future is so much more frighteningly realistic.	I have to admit, it's hard not to make a couple snarky comments when people are posting about literal best sellers and required reading in schools as "books you feel like nobody else has read" I adore the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud, it's like if the Harry Potter world was way more realistic and wizards were shitheads. It's also hilarious. I know it was also a YA best seller but among fans of fantasy and YA I have never run into else who read it, so....I'm snarking myself here, I guess. But seriously, read those goddamn books, people. Even my fantasy-hating husband loved them.
Men who have actually dated someone half your age, what are the pros and cons?	I feel like there’s two reasons men do this and neither are healthy. 1. She’s a trophy. She’s super hot and you get to show her off. Typically successful men who are after improving their image in a kind of twisted way. Same reason they buy a Ferrari, they’re essentially buying a girlfriend. 2. To dominate. Men who want a girl they can completely control and manipulate. You’re gonna have a hard time finding a 35 year old woman that you can do this to. A lot easier if the girl is young enough to be your daughter.	Less baggage, more energy. Generally more positive outlook on life and people, and I enjoy and need that. The bullshit is different, depends on the person. Sometimes it's harder to deal with.
How well suited would you be to life as a vampire?	I have really bad seasonal depression, so I would be the mopiest, emotional vampire ever. Think twilight but so much whinier. Can I take vitamin D supplements as a vampire?	I fucking love garlic. Can I consume my human blood while I'm an animal? Morally I would have trouble killing another human being, but I wouldn't mind sneaking into a blood bank or something and having my 25% there. Humans usually die if they lose around 2L of blood, so my 25% would only be 500mL which is only stealing one bag a week. I know blood supply is short, but I guess it's better than actually killing someone. Besides the garlic love and the killing part, I think I'd manage okay.
What do you find to be some common misconceptions among men about what women want?	Women, at least young ones, are way WAY more interested in a guy's looks than generally admitted. They are shallower about this than men. Look at that OkCupid study where 80% of men are "below average"'in appearance. Fat guys get NO action.	The idea that women know what they want and that everything men should care about is figuring out what that is.
[UPDATE] Do your friends hit on your wife?	The title is misleading, and should be "Do your friends have affairs with your wife?" I'm not calling you out on anything here, but just trying to point out: the fact you didn't phrase it that way tells me you already know your friend and your wife have broken faith with you. That it's far beyond what's normal or acceptable in any relationship. I haven't been in your situation, and can't imagine the betrayal you feel. Neither of them respected you at all in their behavior. Have an (actual) friend and you just go out for a night and talk to him about it. Getting it off your chest and/or raging about it is something any good friend should be able to help you out with. Nobody's going to have your asshole ex-friend's back on this one.	Your wife and friend were flirting with eachother in front of you..... What the fucking fuck. She and him were having fun thinking about how they were fucking while you were right there. She is not a good person. Period. This wasn't a drunk night (which is still a bullshit excuse). This was thought out and flagrant. Talk to a lawyer and get her out of the house and future you were working hard (and faithfully) to build. Congrats of not shooting up the place. I'm so mad right now and I'm not even involved. Stay as calm as you can and stay smart. Keep an extra eye on your finances. Hell, check your and her credit reports to make sure she hasn't taken out any debt you don't know about that you may be on the hook for.
What's the worst "hack" you've seen on the internet?	Any lemon stuff and 5 minutes craft. Never tried any of this, dont want to anyway, ive actually seen people trying on the internet and the outcome was always the same " stupid, dangerous, pointless, ineffective, etc" and it never came out like theirs.	Oh man. I follow a Kmart (different in australia, think trendy, fast fashion homewares for super cheap) hack callout group on Facebook. My favourite was this one person posted their small shelving hack. The hack was that they put things on the shelf. But they called it a hack. I damn near lost it.
What's the most unintentionally offensive thing your S/O has said to you?	My roommates and I were talking about prom and how we spent exorbitant amounts of money. He looks at me and says, "Wow, **ex girlfriend** only spent $60 on hers!" Well good for your fucking ex girlfriend.	A month after my mum died, I started my first year at university, obviously in a pretty fragile place. I visited my boyfriend at the time at his college, only to hear when I got upset "Haven't you gotten over it yet?". I was stunned to say the least. Not sure what planet he was on, or what possessed him to say that, but I certainly shouldn't have stayed in his company for a year after that.
What's the best thing a girl can do to make you feel strong and sexy?	Unless you can maintain the facade for life you should probably just be yourself rather than play act perfection as you will eventually be discovered.	My wife just hit one on the head last night, that I didn't even know mattered to me. She was sitting next to me on the couch with her head on my shoulder, holding my hand, and she said - in this breath-y, exhaling kind of way - "I can't believe how hard you work for us. No one has ever tried so hard to make me happy." I'm not a cryer, but man, my heart was in my throat when I heard that. Because you know what? I **do** work my ass off to make things good for our marriage, our family, and for her specifically. It was like I got the wind knocked out of me, it made me so happy and so relieved.
Speaking of Disney films, who do you think is the true villain in Beauty and the Beast?	I think Gaston gets a bad wrap. His only character flaw is that he's arrogant. That hardly makes you evil. Sure, he's old fashioned when it comes to gender roles but many women are as well. He's pretty much the only person in the town who likes Belle and even though he has bimbos throwing themselves at him, he like the girl with brains. When he hears that she was held captive by a monster he goes to get rid of it. He goes through dark scary woods and into a cursed castle to fight a monster who kidnaps innocent people. Put Gaston in green and it's basically Legend of Zelda.	The sorceress. Who changes an 11 year old, and _every member of their entire household_ to punish them because an 11 year old bratty prince didn't let her in when it was cold out. For that matter, if maybe he was really supposed to be older, why punish _his servants_ when this happened? No wonder he got resentful and LESS trusting of people over time, look at the crap that was done to him and everyone who worked for him.
What are your pettiest life-hacks?	I don't have the manual for my router, but I want to prioritize my Wii U's traffic over everyone else's so that my game of Mario Kart 8/the YouTube app doesn't crash due to a spotty connection.	I had a friend who was late to everything. We just started telling her things started an hour earlier than they did. Worked like a charm.
What made you realize your SO/ex-SO was raised by wolves?	Once I brought my ex some Thai food and he just opened the box, sniffed and seemed really hesitant to eat. That's just fucking offensive.	Every time he peed, my ex would get pee droplets all over the seat and the floor. We didn't live together, so he would do this in my apartment. I would go to the bathroom and see pee everywhere, and when I would go to him like "WTF bro, you pee everywhere," he'd ask me "Well what do you want me to do about it?" -_____- He wasn't raised by wolves, but he was raised by an absolutely insane helicopter mom who no doubt would have no qualms about trailing after her 24 year old son wiping up his pee on the bathroom floor.

Shy guys of reddit: how do I come on to you?	Sounds like you don't want a shy guy, you wan't a reserved person. Shy implies weak willed, socially incompetent, fear of social interaction. Reserved just implies they won't approach you for one reason or another, but it's not related to the issues above. That being said, just say hello. "Hello, my name is I_Shot_JFK, nice to meet you"	Tell him he seems fun or interesting, just let him know you're talking to him because you want to, not because you're waiting for someone else. Get a drink or two in him if you can. Don't make a big deal about long pauses or stutters, we're not well practiced in being social. Go straight into deep topics, we're pretty bad at small talk but we sure as shit love to think, give us something to think about. Be honest, we know when you're lying, we pride ourselves on knowing. Don't focus on our shyness, it's a symptom not a trait, try to figure out why we're shy, that's where the interesting parts of our personality is.
What do you own that might be considered inappropriate for your age or station in life and how do you justify owning it (to yourself or others)?	I am 18 years old and I have a Nintendo, a Sega Genesis, a Super Nintendo, and an N64. I also have a reasonable library of games for each. My parents never bought me things so I always got consoles as hand me downs from my cousin.	My bookshelf is *filled* with YA. Mostly because I started going to the library around 16 years old instead of buying books, so most of my bought books are from before that. But I don't care. Lots of them are also really good books and are still some of my favorites. You can pry my Meg Cabots, Louise Rennisons, and Sarah Dessens from my cold, dead hands.
What is the stupidest mistake you have made while cooking?	I once tipped *all* (and I mean all) the spaghetti I'd cooked for a dinner party into a sink of dirty dish water when I was trying to drain it. Fuck it, I clawed it out with my bare hands, rinsed it under some boiling water and served it anyway. I figure, it's not as bad as the time I probably served up broken glass in a lamb tagine, to four people. Hmm. Maybe should have told that story.	unsure if this counts... i'd heard of using vinegar to do a clean cycle on the coffee machine. having never used vinegar to clean before, i did this with balsamic. which meant i had to do like 4 more water cycles to get the balsamic vinegar taste under control.
What 'knife under the pillow' security measures are normal behaviour and what are borderline crazy?	I keep a hunting knife and a machete sheathed tucked between my bed and the frame (like so the hilt is out). You never know man. I live in the ghettos. I don't own a gun yet so a knife is the next best thing. Hopefully if I ever have to use it it's just to scare an intruder off. At least where I've home safety is a real thing. Locked doors and windows are easy as balls to unlock with a little know how, and that know how is just a Google search away.	Probably best to not keep a weapon literally under your pillow. Keep it a little farther away so that you can't access it while still half-asleep and irrational. Under the bed, in a drawer nearby, some place you need to get up to reach. In combination with a decent alarm system that should be more than sufficient. I just lock my doors, home invasions are extremely rare around here.
Women who have become doctors/tried but dropped out,would you recommend med school and why?	I considered med school and now I’m in dental school because among other reasons I want a family. It wasn’t because I’m not smart enough, I had a 4.0 in undergrad (you don’t have to believe me, I don’t care, it’s anonymous). I didn’t want to spend 4 years in school then bust my ass in residency when I could love what I do and be out in 4 years, and start practicing and making great money, and start a family after my debt is paid off with my eggs being healthy (statistically of course -lol)	I wouldn't recommend against it to someone who wanted to be a doctor, if that makes sense. I don't think it's a career you can choose easily - the money isn't worth the stress and hours of exhaustion, and if you're in it for noble causes there are other professions that can fulfil that noble need without draining your savings and mental health (NB: as much). I would recommend lots and lots of shadowing and work experience. Get an idea of what medicine is really like. When shadowing, try to do a long shift or on call shift so you see the end of the day, shitty parts of it. There are loads of medical specialties and you don't have to know right away which one is the one for you, but it's good to experience them all and understand that there's a big variety.
Have you ever broken up with someone who took it very hard? Did you finally forgive yourself? Why or why not?	I see no reason anyone should ever feel guilty or need forgiven for breaking up with someone. If someone doesn't take being broken up with, that's their own failure, not the fault of the person breaking up with them.	My most recent ex tried overdosing many times over my break up with her. She thought I was the "one". Meanwhile I wanted out because she repeatedly sexually assaulted me. I felt guilty at first once I heard of the suicide attempts, but through therapy I realized that she was only further trying to hurt me via manipulation. I don't feel guilty about breaking up with her now. I only feel guilty that I let her do what she did to me. Still working through that. Only a month removed from it.
What is the most interesting wedding story you know?	It wasn’t technically at the wedding, but literally a week after we got married we found out I was pregnant. I took a test and woke up my new husband to show him the stick, which read “pregnant 5+ weeks”. He said “Oh shit” (in a happy/surprised way) then rolled over and went back to sleep.	My dad runs a food pantry/soup kitchen and he got ordained so that he could perform weddings for the chronically poor guests that usually couldn’t afford a typical wedding. One of these weddings took place in a 1950s themed hair salon where the bride worked. The bride wore her mother’s wedding dress and the groom wore blue jeans, a Guns N’ Roses tee and his finest leather vest. The guest list was small and most people sat in the salon chairs for the ceremony. After the newlyweds kissed we passed around a champagne toast to all of the guests and even the salon customers that attended because the salon was still open during the wedding. It was a very touching and truly bizarre experience.
Ladies, what are some common misconceptions you had before having had sex for the first time that were proven to be untrue?	Definitely changes depending on the guy, but also depends on their mindset. If I'm horny, sometimes my D is ready for round two in like 5-10 minutes. Sometimes, I'm tired and he doesn't want to play. It's sad because you can't force a dick to be hard :/	I assumed semen would just be absorbed by the vagina (like lotion on skin?), rather than sit there and be at the mercy of gravity.
Women with serious mental health issues, past or present: how do you navigate life?	Not sure. I don't generally go out unless I need to, like work or to the store or something. I just generally feel uncomfortable with people all the time, especially if I have to talk to them. I recently tried a fidget cube, and I find it helps a little when I'm feeling nervous with people around.	I really have to view it as a chronic condition that has to be managed, that comes with flare-ups, that I'll probably always be dealing with throughout my life. I tend to go through spells of really hard times, and then the next day I'm totally fine, so I try to remember that the darkest times are not permanent and that things will get better. Getting enough sleep is huge for me, as lack of it triggers anxiety attacks. Also exercise, keeping social and reaching out to friends irl or online, cooking and eating well, meditating and just breathing deeply. I get really frustrated with how much I feel like I've held myself back because of mental health issues, but I also just have to remember that these are the cards that I've been dealt, and that I am doing everything I can to get to a better place.

What criticisms do you have towards modern feminism as a movement, if any?	As a man, I find there's a lot of hypocrisy in today's feminism. I also feel that there's an entire subset of "feminism" where the only goal is to tear down men. It's not so much about achieving equality for both genders as much as it is promoting women as superior to men in every way. Stuff like that creates conflict, and keeps us apart instead of bringing us together. I also don't like how there's no room for dialogue on this issue. We should all be able to talk about this subject and express our opinions and share our experiences and have a healthy discussion overall. It would do more for the movement than anything else. But if we're going to write off every man or every oppositional view as misogynist, wrong, old fashioned, offensive, etc, we won't get anywhere.	The fact that most feminists don't seem to appreciate/understand that there are many schools of feminist thought. I'm tired of people who think their understanding of feminism is The One True Feminism.
If ectogenesis (raising a fetus in an artificial womb) was 100% safe, would you use that option instead of natural pregnancy?	I am child-free, so it wouldn't matter to me, but I think that it would be a wonderful option for women who want children and who may have difficulties conceiving or carrying to term, those who have a fear of or low tolerance for body changes, or for women in appearance-focused careers like actresses/models. I would have no issue with women who chose to use that technology if it was safe and available.	I dunno if emotional detachment is a serious concern. Fathers do not get pregnant, but they're often still emotionally attached to their children.
Men of Reddit land, how do you feel about dating single mums?	I don't want to say there's a 0% chance, so I'll say 1%. I don't want to have to provide for another man's children while he runs around knocking up other girls. Also, single moms seem to search for guys who can provide for her and her kid, as opposed to actually liking the guy for who he is. I would rather not be a walking wallet. Your situation is a classic though. You spend your 20s having fun and hooking up with hot guys on the daily, but as you grow older and your looks fade, you start to realize that you need a provider to fix up your life.	I'm 32, so I'm around your age. I have a huge hesitation when it comes to getting involved with women who have kids. It's not a knock on you. It's due to my own experiences when I was a kid and my parents pursued romantic interests after their divorce. If things were to get serious, then I would have to accept the responsibility of being a father figure to those kids. I know I don't have to literally be their father, but there's still a responsibility there. Not accepting that responsibility wouldn't be fair to you, or the kids. It's not something I take lightly because I know what happens when it goes bad. I lived it. Maybe I'm just being over paranoid, but I don't feel like I'm ready to be that father figure and I'm terrified of becoming the kind person I hated when I was a kid.
Men, what are things women think you find annoying but actually don't bother you at all?	This *should not* be a gender-specific thing, but only women have ever mentioned it for some reason... I'm not bothered at all by people walking slower than I do so I have to slow down. It's true I tend to walk quickly, but it's just a habit. There are at least four women who have repeatedly apologised for walking slowly when we are walking together, despite my telling them each time that I do not care about this. It's the weirdest thing.	Not being perfectly groomed. I honestly prefer my so looking like a hot mess in a hoodie...it's cute as all get out
Men, what books are you reading at the moment and what are some quintessential books that every man should read?	Am re reading ' no more Mr nice guy ' but it's interesting how it really conflicts with '48 laws of power' . Looks to me like I am better off with Glover's book	I'm reading Brothers Karamazov, after reading a Vonnegut quote that read, "There is one other book, that can teach you everything you need to know about life... it's The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, but that's not enough anymore.” Its pretty good, made me think about religion and man's purpose in a way that I had never taken the time to do before. Other books that had a huge impact on me were: Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald, The Stranger by Albert Camus, The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.
What are your favorite cellphone apps?	>I just remembered tinder! Are there any cool tinder equivalences? If y'all are in a committed r'ship, then tinder is THE WORST app to have installed and use btw!	**Swype + Dragon on Android:** turns the shitty Android swype into something really efficient. This his App made me a lot more polite and talkative because texting used to be a chore for me. **QuizzUp**: A Quizz App with tons of topics and that allows you to play against people from all over the world. A pretty neat time-killer. **Spotify** (Paid Version): I've been using Spotify for 5 or 6 years now. Don't regret the investment at all, it's great for any person who remotely interested in music. **Evernote**: I tend to forget all the jokes, thoughts, and small important things of daily life. This app works much better than Google Keep and there's also a Desktop version.
What was it like growing up with hard-partying parents?	they did weed, alcohol, and meth but not much partying. on a good night, they locked themselves in their room and left us alone to make/eat dinner. on a bad night, my dad mixed the wrong shit and went on methrage rampages while my mom followed him around trying to get him to chill and urging us to not call the police. their drug dealer at the time also gave them a special price if he could play with me and my little sister. we were never hurt by him, because my dad was always nearby and would hit us if we made him too excited or made him ''think you're his girlfriend''. we were like 5 and 7.	I spent a lot of time in bars, and surrounded by people I didn’t know very well. It was a lot of chaos and uncertainty. It definitely affected me, and plays a large part in my social anxiety and fierce desire for peace and quiet the majority of the time. I love my parents a lot, and I don’t resent them for it-they were two people who had children and lacked the maturity to realize that having children means your life has to change. It is what it is.
25+ year old bachelors or Reddit, what are some of the most pathetic meals you’ve ever made yourself?	Even my worst meal came out great. The laziest thing I'll do for dinner is bacon, eggs and a hash brown patty. One thing you should never skimp out on or try to take the "easy way" on is your food fellas. You have to eat that. To dine well is self respect.	I can actually cooked, but when I was depressed in uni, I would make this one pot pasta.. In the microwave. I would put pasta, onions, peppers, garlic, habaneros, and other seasonings in the bowl with water, cook it for a while, stir, and Nuke again. By this time the water would have reduced, and I would drain it off, put a sachet of cupa soup and pour it back onto the pasta, crack a tin of sardines, add a pinch of sugar, squirt of mayo, and half can of sweetcorn. Like it sounds gross but I fucking loved it. I can only imagine the amount of toxins I absorbed from that fucking container. Another upside the steam would loosen the grime in the microwave, and ill give it a quick wipe down. such a good dorm mate I was.
What are some of your favorite traditions you and your SO have?	We take turns disappointing each other, ignoring each other, feeling bad, and making up for it. At least once a month maybe?	Every Halloween we get loaded and watch Nightmare Before Christmas. Every Christmas we get loaded, make lasagna, and watch Muppet Christmas Carol.
Do you take unattractive or average girls into consideration when you say women can get sex/dates easier than guys?	Unattractive, yes. Average, no. Askmen also seems to think that a woman's appearance is all she needs to get laid. From my experiences, that's not true.	Average girls can get easier sex/dates than average guys. I'd say that unnatractive guys *may* have a slight advantage over unnatractive girls but its very difficult for both sides
A common stereotype is men 'protecting' women - but have you ever been in a situation where you 'protected' a male from something/someone? What's your story?	Yes. I've protected my brother, boyfriends, male cousins, small male children Because that's how shit works. Of fucking course there are women who have protected men. Of fucking course there are men who have protected women. Women who have protected women. Men who have protected men.	For as long as I can remember I considered it my job to do this for my younger brother as we grew up in a troubled household. I apparently did such a good job that he didn't know how bad things were until he was in his late teens.
Why is that one friend terrible with dating?	Thinks bumble/pof/tinder are good places to find relationships. Thinks she's in love with every guy that makes it to a second date.	She's in that life stage where she keeps trying to date douchy, emotionally unavailable partyboys and doesn't/can't see them for what they are until after several dates, if ever. She really wants to see the good in people, so much so that she completely ignores the bad. She's a very sweet, kind, compassionate person, to the point of never speaking ill of anyone, no matter what they did. She excuses terrible, douchy behaviour from dates because "they had a bad day/week/childhood/previous relationship/breakup". I love her dearly, but sweet baby Jesus on a tricycle honey, sometimes a guy is just a fucking jerk and it's okay to say that about him.
Are there any certain sex positions that make you feel closer to your partner? What are some intimate positions for you?	I'm reading all these "I don't have sex unless I have feelings" and im like "don't worry... you'll grow up soon enough and be one dead inside like the rest of us	I mean it's hard to beat missionary for intimacy. It's full body touching with lots of eye contact. Physically it feels as close together as you can possibly get.
What do you love most about your SO?	She respects me and doesn’t snipe me at every turn. I swear to god damn near every other relationship I see, nag, nag, nag... snipe, snipe, snipe... you married this person on purpose right?	She’s incredibly smart, emotionally intelligent, a great communicator and my kind of gorgeous. She wandered into my life when I was least expecting it and I’ve loved every minute of it.
Those of you who online date, is there one message that made you go, "Nope!" to a girl who otherwise everything was going well before meeting?	I would think any girl who openly calls herself a feminist without me asking I would stop talking to them. That means you hate all men, not that you want equal treatment for men and women.	Last week I had a girl on tinder who started talking about her evangelical church. WHY ARE U ON TINDER THEN
Anxious people, when did you have the realization that your anxiety was more extreme than normal?	When I cried in class so often that people started to bully me and nobody wanted to be my friend. I was only 11 when I started on anxiety meds.	When it got bad enough that I couldn't do things that I needed to do, like go outside to get food or do laundry, because I was afraid of people seeing me. Before that I just thought "everyone gets nervous, everyone freaks out sometimes, it's normal." In retrospect, a lot of my behavior in the past was very much not normal.
What's the most shocking thing your wife has wanted to try or do sexually in your relationship?	Not my wife, but had a girl in college who asked if I would submit to being pegged, I noped out of that situation real fast!	Not my wife, but I was making out in the back of my car with this sweet, “innocent” southern girl I had just started dating and out of nowhere she grabs my hand, slaps herself across the face with it, and told me to choke her. I mean I obliged, but that was quite a shock
Men, how long do you usually last in bed?	I try to knock it out inside of 5 minutes. It gets hard though because it's so easy for me to last a long time. I found that if I got my wife on top of me, with her back towards me and her legs spread while I'm inside her, I can knock it out faster. It helps a lot if she comes once or twice. I like this position because it puts me in control of making her cum faster. The faster she can knock hers out, the faster I can knock mine out. If anything the real question should be how many times you can go in a day. On a perfect weekend I'd like to have a marathon and see who could have more orgasms. I think I could totally win at that one against my wife.	7-8 hours. Maybe closer to 10 hours on weekends, especially in the winter when it's so cold. I hate getting out from under my warm blankets. :(
Women who have used a male prostitute, why did you do it and how was it? Have you done it again since?	This is kind of an interesting question. I've never had to because if I was that desperate, well, Craigslist is free.	I hired a male tantric masseuse. We didn't actually have intercourse, but I had a very amazing, very long sexual massage. I was curious about tantric massage and after lots of emailing, he seemed very knowledgeable. If he was still available, I would absolutely hire him again. He isn't available and the others I've spoken to since do not seem to be at his skill level.
Would any of you NOT want to receive nudes?	I think sending nudes is a pretty clear sign of poor judgment, which is something I generally don't look for in a partner. I guess I wouldn't really be *put off* by it, but it certainly would influence my opinion of the person.	I speak for myself when I say that under the assumption of being interested in the girl: I always welcome it.
How important is a girl's hair in terms of their attractiveness?	Very. Women tend to have longer necks and short hairstyles make them look like giraffes. 😆 Shoulder length at the shortest and I find long hair to be very feminine and sexy. In a rare issue if she doesn't have any or it's short b/c of sickness or injury that's fine. Looking like a boy with a man-cut is not attractive.	You think it's not important until you see a girl with a terrible haircut. Same goes for guys often. But a bit more for girls. Healthy hair is #1, and then a good style can make a girl go from pretty to beautiful.
Askmen, how do your dating experiences mesh with what you read on here?	Pretty consistent. Chicks are mostly interested in what they can get out of a relationship and not so interested in what they can contribute to one.	I don't know anyone killing it in the dating scene to be honest. Most of my friends would like to if given the chance, but at best usually settle down with one girl because they don't have the option to just fuck around. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but studies have shown this generation is having sex less than the previous generation. My reason as to why is with the rise of online dating, people are getting pickier.
If you're a guy who has kids but another man is raising them: how does it make you feel if/when they call him dad?	Not exactly what you are asking, but. I just got remarried and I have a three year old I split 50/50 with her mom. I'm "daddy", my ex is "mommy" and my wife was just "Kristi" when we started dating. Now we encourage her to say "momma kristi." Not Mommy, but my wife is just as involved as my ex in this girl's life now and we want her to look at her as a parent.	I'm actually cool with it. I've actually gotten to know the guy, we have a few things in common, we talk and get excited over a lot of the same things. So I'm okay if my son calls him "daddy". He calls me "daddy" too. Plus it's still funny to me if we're both at my ex's house and my son says "Daddy?" and we say "yes?" at the same time. I call it "parenting in stereo".
Men of Reddit who have put a dog to sleep, my dog has to be put to sleep. What do I do?	>Is it normal to cry? It's *your dog*. If you don't cry, you're a robot. There's really nothing that makes it easier. Don't leave his side until he's gone.	One thing you don't do is leave your dog when it's happening, if you do, he'll be spending his last moments looking for you. Be there with him the whole time, and don't be shy to tell him you love him and cry if you have to. Dogs are a wonderful blessing that we have in life and they are ridiculously loyal and loving to us. It isn't going to be easy, but make sure that you give him the best two days you possibly can. Stay strong dude.
Is my job a turn off?	Guy here, if a woman you meet asks your profession just tell her it's a bit strange to most people and you don't like to talk about it until you know the person better. This will intrigue them, women love a bit of mystery. When you do tell them, don't be the least bit embarrassed, be proud of what you do and emphasis the emotional aspects rather than the technical. Assuming it's true, talk about wanting to help people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.	Best thing I can tell you is that it's not about the job, it's about your presentation. Think of it like a resume. You probably don't want to go around telling the girl you're dating how much ass it kicks to embalm corpses all day because she won't "get it." Just say, "actually, it's not that bad" and mention that it pays well or whatever. Try to ease her into it by not letting the subject stay up for too long at a time in the earlier points.
What harmless secret does your SO think he/she is hiding from you, and how did you find out about it?	mark my words; it's near impossible to hide anything from a woman. even when we "don't know", we still had a subtle hint about it somewhere in the female intuition lands of the inner female psyche. nodnod	My husband thinks he was sneaky last year buying me an oven for Christmas and then hooking it up Christmas Eve while I slept. I found the oven a week prior since I had to run to our storage unit for something and that's where he had hid it (to be fair, I hadn't been to the storage unit for like six months, so it was a good plan). I didn't sleep because he was making such a racket moving the old oven out and the new one in. Oh well. I acted shocked and let him have his win.
Men who were cheated on in a LTR, how long until you were able to trust someone in a relationship again (or were you unable to)?	Women cheat. Say it with me: women cheat. It's what they do, and it's unlikely that you'll find the exceedingly rare forever-faithful type. Don't let their infidelities affect your self-image. Keep future partners at a metaphorical arm's length--no cohabitating, joint finances, or ovum fertilization. You should know in the back of your mind that you can walk away from a relationship at any time with minimal cost. And don't let your relational status get in the way of getting yours.	I think it's one of those things, like your house getting hit by a tornado. You never feared it before because you didn't really think it could happen to you even though you know it's possible. After it happens even though you feel safe in your new house from day to day, storm clouds always bring dread of what may happen.
What were you certain was not "just a phase," but turned out to be totally just a phase?	My hard left liberal phase. Stopped using certain words because they were offensive, constantly said that guys suck and stuff, and women are so under privileged. Now I'm just hating everyone and everything and hate the left as much as I hate the right. Solidly middle on a lot of shit at this point, and it feels more adult like than taking sides.	lol, I cringe when I think of my emo phase. My mam wouldn't even let me be a proper emo because I couldn't dye or straighten my hair. I was like emo lite.
Dating Question - How old is too old to be living with my parents?	I don't think any age is too old as long as you are having a good living. I think it is plain stupid for someone making peanuts or living paycheck to paycheck to be living off by themselves. Many other countries have their children living with them until they are married. I lived with my parents for 3.5 years after college even though I was making over $160k/year. Granted I also used their other homes along their main estate.	Times are changing in my opinion. Some absurd amount of people high into there 20's still live with their parents. Some because they can't afford to move out because of debt from school and some because they're trying to get ahead and save money. Either way who cares what other people think. I could of moved out a while ago but I'm saving money to buy a condo or small house. Screw renting.
Do you prefer a partner to be of equivalent intelligence, or do you prefer to be the 'smart' one/do you prefer your partner to be, and why?	I have yet to have a relationship with someone more intelligent than me. But intelligence isn't everything. My wife has a lot more EQ than I do, and helps me where I am lacking.	As smart as possible. My wife is a straight up genius. I like it. I'm not dumb myself, but what's hotter than a woman who can explain the subtleties of foreign policy who also happens to be a total babe? We kind of cover each others' blind spots when it comes to intelligence. She's a lot better at understanding people, I'm a lot more of an analytical type at coming up with what our options are at any given time. Together we are a superbrain.
What made you stay for too long with a person you've already fallen out of love with?	I'm afraid I'm just spoiled and will want out again as soon as I'm in the next relationship. Right now we live together in an expensive area and being separated would make it way more difficult for both of us. I'm guessing the answer for me is to live alone and date around a bit until I find someone who fits but I work from home and know very few people in my city.	Change is difficult. I didn't want to hurt her, as she was a great person. The sex was awesome. All of that, and it made ending the relationship worse. Always best to end it once you're sure.
Men of Reddit, I am a lady who can't have PIV - what would you like someone in my position to do?	I went through something similar. For me the solution was frightfully simple (may not work for you though). 1. I was trying to operate as a pure sapiosexual. I was not physically attracted to anyone I dated and just could not open. 2. That set of guy's didn't care and tried anyway even when I said it was painful - cease and desist. Solution 1. Dated men I found attractive and arousing. Solution 2. Only dated men who were respectful and cared whether they were causing me physical pain. I hope your solution is as fundamental. I never apologized or warned people I couldn't. Also, I insisted they get STI tested before trying anyway. Unfortunately, warning men about a lack of experience seemed to make them more aggressive. Good Luck TLDR: Only date nice people you find attractive who can respect "stop, you're hurting me."	You're asking the wrong questions. You should not be thinking about a relationship without also thinking about addressing this problem. What you are describing is something you need professional medical help with. If you can afford it, go for therapy with a qualified sex therapist. I'm not suggesting you DON'T start dating. I'm suggesting you deal with this at the same time. Get some help :) THAT should be your priority here. Good luck!
Who is that one stranger that you still remember? Why?	I was very in tune... I sat on a bench on the oval at OSU and I was eating a carrot and I heard this voice in my head “I’m gonna go sit next to her” and I thought, okay, and then this man came and at next to me. We talked. I told him what happened. It was pleasant. I think his name was Bradley. My hearing experience was common then.	The elderly gentleman in Target when my daughter was 2 & on the verge of a tantrum. My husband had been deployed for 3 months at that time, out of a 9 month deployment, and I didn't have much patience left before my own tantrum. He gently rested his hand on top of mine & told me I was doing all the right things and to ignore the judgy looks from strangers. It was such a simple act of kindness & empathy that was enough to put me back in the right headspace to console my daughter.
What is the darkest, most terrible joke you know?	What’s the hardest part about having sex with a 6 year old? Getting the blood off of your clown suit.	I saw a black guy riding a bike this morning so I went to the garage to check it wasn’t mine and there it was still chained up, but asking for food.
Women in tech: As a guy, what are some things I can do to improve things for you?	TBH you need to do the exact opposite of asking this question. Treat women exactly like you would treat anyone, theres no reasons to complicate things. Just by asking this, or planning to go out of your way to make things feel "inclusive" for women, you are acknowledging and defining some imaginary line that separates the two sexes, which is the whole problem.	A lot of women fail to find mentors in the work place. If you're in a management position, mentor the women under you as much as you mentor the men under you. Invite us to happy hour and other social aspects of the workplace. Don't leave us out. In meetings, if we say something important or have a good idea repeat it and give us credit "I like what Muppet is saying about our firewall system, she's got a good idea there." And if we're interrupted, direct the conversation back towards us. "What were you saying about the firewall Muppet?"
Men of Reddit: what's the one thing you keep in your wallet besides money and cards. Some people keep a condom, some people Band-Aids, what about you?	I know it sounds pretentious, but for 18 years I have a credit card sized copy of the UN Declaration of Human Rights from Amnesty International in my wallet. Just in case of an argument with any right-wing idiot.	I keep a picture of my best friend when he was a kid. Always makes me happy to see my bro when I'm down, I love him so much. We're both in college and go to different schools but whenever break rolls around we always go out of our way to link up again. Always a great time with him.
When did you have your first kiss?	I was like 19? Turns out kissing is really gross, I'm a bit of a germaphobe, and I never want to do it again 🤷‍♀️	It was on my first real date which was a month before my 27th birthday. Edited to include: *LATE BLOOMERS, YOU ARE NOT ALONE*
Those who have or have had a low libido, what did you find that helped increase it?	Discovering cohabiting partnerships are my reason of anxiety and low libido. Discovering that monogamy was not for me. Discovering that I'm much happier with multiple partners and variety of sexual encounters.	Losing weight and cleaning up my diet. I think part of it was that I just didn't feel attractive. But also I was just tired all the time and bloated, and I really think a shitty diet can mess with your hormones. I focused on getting healthy (losing weight was just a by-product of that). I have so much more energy and confidence.
How have you dealt with "low key" sexual harassment in the workplace?	I had one guy infer I was a slut because I mentioned having a long weekend (in an extremely casual and nonsuggestive way). This was also my first week on the job.	"Quit being weird" "That's not funny" "Don't make this awkward" said in a dead pan voice, straight faced. Make them uncomfortable. I used to work in a mostly male environment. We all got along really well, always joking and laughing. One day one of the guys crossed the line and made a comment about my breasts. I stopped laughing, looked him dead in the eye, and said "That is not okay." He immediately apologized. They may not always have that great of a reaction, but by directly confronting the situation sometimes you can shame them into proper behavior. EDIT - I only advise using this method for small, innocuous moments with people who you usually never have problems with. If someone is being very overt, or doing little shit over time, you need to document every interaction and report it when you have a nice stack of evidence.
What are some early indications that a girl might be **too** high maintenance for your taste?	Has a nice car. She wears overpriced, oversized Gucci sunglasses that probably cost around $200-$500. Wearing the latest designer clothes and shoes. Unapproachable, negative body language. Has a "It's all about me and no one else" attitude.	I love When Harry Met Sally. Relevant dialog: Harry Burns: There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance. Sally Albright: Which one am I? Harry Burns: You're the worst kind; you're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance. Sally Albright: I don't see that. Harry Burns: You don't see that? Waiter, I'll begin with a house salad, but I don't want the regular dressing. I'll have the balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side. And then the salmon with the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side. "On the side" is a very big thing for you. Sally Albright: Well, I just want it the way I want it. Harry Burns: I know; high maintenance.
Many men claim, that they don't like heavy make up, so how come, the heavy make up pic's always get more likes/attention?	More than likely they aren't after the makeup. Seemed pretty obvious what their real end-game goal is. "Maybe if I like enough if her pics I can has the sex." It's pretty sad tbh, but so is uploading pics 24/7 for validation.	I worked with a girl that put on a ton of makeup to contour her face. I didn't think much of it, until I realized that **she was literally painting on cheekbones**. Kind of an interesting way to look at it. I'm sure glad I'm not expected to put on makeup to paint a jawline on myself, what a pain.
How *exactly* am I supposed to ask a guy out?	If you know so little about him (if he has a gf, not knowing when you'll see him next) then you don't know him well enough for him to want to spend time with you. Try forging a connection. Maybe he'll then ask *you* out. Asking someone out is an organic process that begins when you already have rapport, not before. Sometimes even a non-date becomes a date. It doesn't have to have a label that will just crush everyone under the weight of expectations. If you need to have a game plan, you're already overthinking it.	"I would like to get ...(coffee, beer, dinner, etc) with you" Alternatively, present a properly signed and notarized form 1489-74b from the federal sex bureau.
What’s small steps can I take to be more masculine?	2 separate questions: 1. What does being masculine mean to you? What does that look like? 2. How do you dress? Do your clothes actually fit you? If your clothes are quite loose then you will appear more childish.	Take care of yourself, your SO and other important people in your life, adopt a firm handshake, project your voice more (use more air when speaking, hold it in your chest) learn when and how to cry, don't bottle how you feel up, but learn how to do it in an acceptable way, not a great list, but it's one I stick to.
Is your girlfriend/wife funny?	>I see a lot on /r/AskMen[1] that women aren't "lmao-rofl" funny like guys. They aren’t. It is exceedingly rare. However, my ex-girlfriend was unusually funny. She could actually make me laugh out loud. That is rare for me. I really prized that in her. Edit: Wow, r/ask(premenstrual)women really leaked on this one!	Funny in that she says things that make me laugh - no. Funny in that she's a gigantic goofball, who is so silly she sends *herself* into gigglefits that in turn crack me up - 100% yes.
What was the most uncomfortable thing you’ve had to do for your SO out of politeness?	Listen to his mother in law talk about my husbands brothers balls (cancer). She asked me to check to make sure my husbands were ok.	Went suit shopping with my SO and his mom and she kept talking to the tailor about how my SO needs "*just a little more room in the package area*" and trying to get me to confirm for her. Like no lady I'm not gonna talk with you about your son's dick but thanks anyway.
Have any of you ever met a "redpiller" or someone who would qualify in real life? What's the story ?	Isn't this one of those things where you only notice it if the guy is bad at it. Almost all of these comments are about socially awkward guys, who then try and compensate with trp stuff, but they are still socially awkward in the first place. Do women think/realize that it is effective when done right (even though that's entering no true Scotsman territory)?	Yeah one guy. He was in my lab group in college. Smart guy, just really socially stunted. It's sad because anyone could tell he didn't have a whole lot of confidence, and the whole "alpha-male/ladykiller" schtick was just a way to compensate. Unfortunately those types often come off as clumsy caricatures of the real "casanovas" they're trying to emulate. It's hard to make fun of them in real life. Mostly it's just depressing and you don't want to think about them too much because it's a bummer.
how aware are you of a girls body during a hug?	It really depends on the situation but generally I don't really focus on a girl's body when hugging. Hugging is primarily a mechanic that demonstrates emotional proximity, which can coincide with physical attraction but it doesn't have to. Sure, when I hug my best friend I can feel her warmth, smell her really good and feel her boobs pressed against me. But I am primarily just really glad that we met, can sit down and spend some time in this busy world. This pretty much describes my position. I might want to add that I don't just go around hugging girls I don't really know, so...	It's hard to analyze her body without the correct samples, so I always make sure to discretely take body fat %, water levels, height, weight and a blood sample while hugging a girl for the most through results later.
During sex with my partner, I said in a dirty voice that his grabbing my ass was like "you're kneading two lumps of dough". Cheer me up with some embarrassing times you failed at being sexy?	Not sure why I'm seeing this because I'm not a woman. But my wife, back when we actually had sex, once sneeze and got snot all over me. Wasn't that bad.	I was having stupid drunk sex with my ex-boyfriend and I was on top. He grabbed a hold of my rib cage with both hands, close to my armpits and it tickled SO much. I told him to stop, but he didn't and I just peed. Peed all over him. Yep...
What up with guys loving their head and beard being scratched?	depends my head is covered in tumours so when a girl tries to scratch my head she usually comes away with bloody fingers. but generally its considered pleasent.	basically, every man is touch-starved from a very early age. it's a cultural problem and its known to be a contributing factor to a lot of health problems. ladies, touch your man more, he needs it.
What do you guys feel about sperm donation?	Don't do it. Never do it. The day will come when some woman or kid identifies you and then your life is ruined. Pay up! No, the law doesn't matter. The law may state that you're safe, but judges always *put the kid's interest first* which means if somebody thinks you should pay for the kid, *you will pay for the kid*.	It bums me out because I'm forbidden from donating sperm. I'm not tall enough. Eugenics at work I guess. I'd do it if I could. Easy money and I wouldn't have some hang up knowing that I have genetic progeny walking around. In fact It'd be perfect since as of now, I don't want to have kids, but the main thing that bothers me about that is my lack of legacy and ending my bloodline which goes back as long as humanity has been around. I wouldn't have to worry about that anymore.
Guys of AskMen, what is it about female promiscuity that bothers you, if it does?	I personally don't care at all, I mean I don't have any qualms about other guy's dicks having been, at some point in the past,inside a girl I like. I just don't care and I'm not naive about it, I'd even go as far as to say that it's good because that means she probably has good experience. However, such behavior is risky due to STDs so it does matter a deal. It's a case-by-case thing though, so I don't play by any general rule, and I would never turn down a girl on the sole basis of having a promiscuous past.	I'm with you if the guy actually *is* being hypocritical. My issue would be if the number was "off" with your partner. If one person has had 2 sexual partners and the other has had 52, I think that's a problem. It is indicative that the two people have differing views on sex and the meaning of sex. It isn't necessarily an insurmountable problem, but it is definitely an issue that is worthy of discussion.
Fellas, what is your relationship with your Dad like?	I don't know how to put it into words, but killing him with my bare hands would bring me soooooooooo much fucking joy. I'd look him right in the fucking eyes, tell him IM the reason his life is ending, and watch that light fade. I fucking despise that piece of shit.	Excellent, He raised me as a single parent since my mother died when I was just 2 months old and as cheesy as it may sound he's my hero, my mentor and one of my best friends.
Women who have decided not to have a dog, what made you decide that?	I like that this this post quoted > [Women who have decided not to have children, what made you decide that?](https://redd.it/4n4n0h) Some people have dogs as an alternative to having kids.	- I don't want the additional expenses that come with dog ownership - I don't want to pick up poop - I don't want to go for a walk everyday
I told a girl that if a guy sleeps with her and never talks to her again its not because you slept with him its because he didn't like you and only wanted to sleep with you. Was I being too harsh?	I'm not sure you gave her great advice. Sure, it's great for thirsty guys to have more uninhibited girls out there. And for a few years, the guys and the girls have fun. But a huge fraction of men (myself included) will have less desire for a long term relationship with a woman who has a history full of putting out easily for other guys. Men just don't face that social consequence (for the same behavior) to a comparable degree. Fair or not, if a woman prioritizes an LTR later in life, being wary of one night stands is a good adaptation.	So imagine you're into this girl, you get along great, you have sex, awesome. Why would you not see her again? The answer is that he didn't think they got along as well as she thought they did.
My new puppy or the girlfriend, which one do I choose?	Puppy, puppy always, if my ex wanted to get back and got a puppy I'd love the puppy as well.	1) that mindset, the idea of "them or me" is toxic as hell and will bite you in the ass. 2) you made a commitment to that dog and you should live up to it. the girlfriend you're still deciding on.
[NSFW] What Changes would you make for the Vagina 2.0?	I got feeling that with all these "activated of non-consensual penetration" mechanisms my precious little guy could get into serious trouble in really innocent situations: What if it's getting frisky with your gf and you fumble around and you just stick it in for shits and giggles but she actually wasn't prepared for that and you end up with a liquefied/mangled dick :(	1. Built in contraceptive controlled at will 2. Easily & consistent clitoral and vaginal orgasms for all! 3. Periods are kinda like taking a shit. You get warning, you go to the bathroom and dump that sucka, you go about your day. 4. Vaginas smell like candy. Or vanilla 5. Secretes a poison that melts objects in instances of non-consent 6. Pest resistant - no yeasties, no BV, no STIs If we're including all repro areas: 4. Childbirth is waaaay safer and the vagina is all like "Shoot this kid out? NO PROBLEM YO" 5. No endo, no PCOS, no ectopic pregnancies, no vaginismus
Women who love their career choice, what is it and why do you love it?	I love my freedom and don't get trapped inside a boring rhythmic office. I feel proud being a lady in my line too :)	I'm a marine biologist who studies whales and dolphins. Like any job, there are pros and cons but I really enjoy my work. It's difficult to find employment in my field of study because it's very competitive, so I consider myself very lucky.
How do you make peace with the fact that your life didn’t turn out the way you wanted it to ?	Wine has been useful. It helps to zone out and imagine you’re in your mansion with John Stamos making love to you when in reality you’re in a 1br apartment in the suburbs with a sweaty, balding man grunting as he thrusts and thumbs your asshole. Mmmm. Wine.	I did two things. A) I changed what I wanted to be more in line with my life today. B) I realized that what I wanted from my life would make me sad/alone in the end. My mom is very fond of saying that "Who you are when you are 10 isnt who you are when you are 25." Don't let who you were define who you should be.
What is something every woman should know about her boyfriend?	A Man need quiet time and not be bothered unless for sex, food, beer... you get the idea. She should know that he needs time to spend with his bros without being bombarded with “when you coming? When you coming home?” She should know NOT to nag, nag, nag. She should know how to be direct when she wants something. Giving hints and clues only confuses a man. If you want sex from him, just say I’m honey, let’s fuck. If you want a specific present for your birthday, anniversary, etc, tell him “this is _______ (fill in what you want) for my birthday or anniversary. When going out to eat, don’t pick food from my plate. Order your own. More of a wish list for me.	Something he would like when stressed after a long day. My girlfriend will see my overwhelmed face when I get home sometimes, grab an Easy Mac from a hidden cabinet somewhere, and let me just zone out on the couch silently for a while. It's the greatest. Somehow we pass as adults.
I'm moving into college in three weeks and I have no decorations! What's some cheap, cool ideas?	You're gonna move so many times on the next few years. Buy nothing, things just appear and follow you from house to house.	Zen Minimalism. Get some nice looking rocks from the driveway, a bonsai or other cheap plant. Done. Another option could be : don't decorate on arrival. Just bring in some nice bedding, cushions and blankets, and leave space for your new home to be organically filled by all the things you'll love over the next few months.
Those who need them, do you prefer to wear contacts or glasses? why?	Glasses. I can't stand putting stuff in my eyes, and I've been paranoid about then not being able to get them \*out\* or getting infections.. The worst thing that can happen with my glasses is I smear something greasy on them or have to adjust if watching TV lying down (I keep an old pair as my emergecy spares as my eyesight is pretty bad)	I wear contacts for many of the reasons mentioned already but one weird perk is that my eyes don't water when I'm chopping onions with contacts in.
You have a girlfriend who made you wait until the 10th date before having sex with you. Midway through your relationship, you find out she has a long history of casual sex and hookups with guys she barely knew. How would you react?	This is the saddest post I’ve ever read in this sub. Has it been brigaded or something? Nobody is entitled to sex with another. Just the use of the term withholding is making me cringe. So many paradoxes and hypocrites here it makes my head spin.	I’d be totally fine with taking it slow & not having sex immediately since that’s what I’d want to do anyway. I wouldn’t want to know about all her hookups & casual sex though tbh
What's the best way an SO has ever woken you up?	I was just barely awake and her first words to me were "I'm so horny, I want you so bad." Made her wait till I ate breakfast cause I can't do any of that on an empty stomach.	A gentle handjob until I was rock hard and just a little awake and then guiding me into her. Various partners have tried waking me up with head, but it never works out - all the moving around to get mouth to cock access always wakes me up.
How would you feel if the brother or father of a woman you were dating gave you a "warning"?	Yeah it's a threat......... so what? Any father worth his salt will scare the shit out of you for at least a little while, Same thing with brothers. What's the big deal?	"If you hurt her, I'll hurt you worse." "And what if she hurts me?" They never know how to answer that.
What advice would you give a girl when it comes to choosing an outfit for a first date?	Personally, I would call all of them trying too hard. I do have a very toned down and practical sense of style, so I would consider wearing sweat pants to be just fine and jeans to be dressing up. It does, of course, depend on what you are doing. Going hiking is on my list of things I would like to do on a date, and cargo pants are the practical choice for that kind of activity.	holy low cut option four batman! But seriously, I would show up to a first lunch date in jeans with a nice shirt, which would be a safe bet for you as well in most social circles.
Men of reddit: How do I get over the fact my 20s were a failure compared to most other guys?	How about you try not being a fucking whiner? Why on earth are you comparing your experience to anyone else's as a metric of success or self-worth? That's pathetic and immature. All the wasted years are over, that you is dead, so there really isn't anything to get over other than this mincing little bitch phase you seem to be stuck in. You've identified your problem areas, now change your fucking behavior or shut your fucking cunt mouth.	I think that you need some perspective here: 1 - you have had long term relationships, which is better than many men. 2 - you persevered and completed a degree even though you didn’t enjoy it. This shows good attitude and effort. 3 - you have a job and are working to support yourself 4 - you have travelled to many places and experienced the world. You are comparing yourself to a Hollywood fantasy, which isn’t real. It does sound that you are isolated and lonely though, so I’d suggest speaking to a therapist or life coach to work through how to improve this and your own self-image. You are doing much, much better than you think you are.
What is it like to have a woman hit on you? How often does it happen?	I generally let girls express interest in me or hit on me rather than being the first to do it. It's fairly often, pretty nice and once they've done it I know I'm in.	If she asked to touch, that was her hitting on you. I've never been hit on so I can't add anymore haha^fml
Do guys masturbate to girl's bikini pics on Facebook...?	I've never done it, seems really weird to me. I've never heard any of my IRL friends admit to it either, and I'd be pretty surprised if I found out they did. The awkwardness/creepiness factor, plus the fact that there's *actual pornography* online is enough to put me off doing it, and then there's the whole using-someone's-pictures-without-their-consent thing that is pretty awful IMO.	A girl you've met is generally more attractive than a girl who has always been in 2 dimensions. That said, yeah, it's awkward.
Married men of askmen, how far into the relationship were you sure she/he was the one?	Three months, well that's when we found out she was 5 weeks pregnant...married for a rollercoaster year. Two years later and the divorce still isn't finalized.	I knew after the first date that my first wife was the one. That marriage lasted 20 years, and was only cut short by her death due to cancer. I remarried. I knew after a week. We got married this past March. I'm never letting her go.
What are some examples of healthy boundaries in a relationship?	Have your own things that you do without your SO, like your own hobbies. Have your own group of friends that you hang out with, without each other. Don’t become one entity and do everything together. Be able to spend time apart without getting restless about it. Basically, have some semblance of your lives separate from each other. Oh and also, no shaving pubes in front of each other or peeing/pooping whilst your SO is in the bathroom with you. I’ve heard of some couples who do both those things and it’s weird af...	Having a life outside of your relationship. Like not spending all your free time with your SO and neglecting your friends & family. Not having them read your texts from your family & friends. Not get offended when they do the same.
What are you ashamed to admit has happened to you more than once?	Accidates. I've just now gotten to the point where I've had more actual dates than accidental. And a few months ago, I STILL had an accidate.	Woke up at night. Didn't turn on the light. Grabbed a mug. Poured water into it. Splashes out. "Holy shit that overflowed fast". Turn on the light. Mug is upside down
Where can a conservative girl learn her kinks?	what was your religion? please don't hate your religion because of your family, lol. but if you're still religious then some books on sex techniques and positions etc will benefit u (it benefits u anyway since u don't like porn)	I would recommend reading. Try Literotica and see if something appeals to you. Also, I picked up the Boudoir Bible last year and thought it was good. I'm a pretty experienced pervert, but I think it was a good introduction to lots of different things.
How would you feel IRL about dating an immortal being who was 100+ years older than you, like a vampire or Time Lord?	In my opinion, in the twilight saga, Bella should have gone for the werewolf. On other hand, I guess it would be an interesting experience, it would be like having a highly misogynistic, prone to violence and racist person who would like you and expect you to have his heir or something. If they are open minded and nice you could show them the new world. Lack of hookup culture.	Can I also become a vampire? Eventually I'll be 900 years old and they'll be 1000. By then we should have stuff in common and could maybe give it a shot.
Am I out of line for not wanting my husband to spend time with a particular woman anymore?	I'd bet Money that they've done a lot more than spot each other at the gym already. Your husband and this chick have absolutely no respect for you at all and you sound like a pushover bcuz ur husband is comfortable as a Fuck to even dream of bringing this lady around you.	> Than she says in a flirty voice, "If I was his wife I would suck his dick everyday." over the line
To men who are on the smaller side, how do you maintain your sexual confidence?	Most girls don't care that much, why should I? I guess once I started just being friends with girls that I wasn't sexually interested in I learned just to be more comfortable around all women.	I am so god damn good with my tongue. It don't matter how tiny a guy is if she has come 4 times before pee-wee gets tagged in
Men of Reddit how do you really feel about giving your gf oral sex?	love doing it, but some vaginas are far more visually appealing than others. I don't know if others guys notice it but vaginas with a fuck ton of flap and skin aren't visually appealing to me at all.	Don't enjoy the act itself, but it makes her happy, so that makes me happy. I imagine a lot of women feel the same way. That said, the feeling of thighs around my head is absolutely divine.
When did you first realize you were in love?	I can't say I ever was in love. First time I thought I was, proceeded to let myself be led on and used for money and bail outs for years. Never again.	Long long time ago............... 1971. I was 16, and had been hanging out with this pretty little hippie chick for about 6 months........I would walk down to meet her halfway when we got together. This certain summer day I saw her walking towards me at a distance, and I could not stop smiling, a silly grin so wide my I thought my face would split................:) It lasted the whole time she approached, grinning back at me. We've been married over 38 years.
Ladies who got married very young/ straight out of college, what are you experiences?	Married at 20. Divorced at 21. Married because pregnant though. I would not recommend it. Honestly, I don't think anyone under 25 should be allowed to get married.	I got married at 20. We were both very religious, we didn't live together before our wedding, and we were both virgins. We divorced two years later because he was abusive and I drifted away from organized religion when I was told that God wanted me to stay with my husband no matter how badly I was being treated. I'm a very happy single atheist now, a decade later.
What does sex feel like to you?	Feels an awful lot like my dick is in a slightly slimy hole. No emotional feelings unless I'm drunk. Sober= holy shit this is boring, I could be doing something more fun. Drunk = holy shit, this isokay, I guess I'll play along and try to have fun.\	Like that feeling when after a long day of work you take your shoes off, while taking a much needed piss, while drinking water when super thirsty, while finally scratching an itch, while eating a delicious medium rare, ribeye steak, while winning at Dark Souls, while getting my paycheck, while my dog is playing with me, while my penis is in a vagina.
Men, how do you feel about a girl who is actually thousands of venomous insects clad in a visage of flesh?	Honestly, can we stop with all the parody posts? I used to enjoy the interesting question and responses, but now the only thing that makes it to the frontpage are these joking posts.	If you can't handle me at my buggiest, you don't deserve me at my fleshiest. Edit. I'm a little high

How do I stop casually dating a girl that I'm not that interested in, without being a dick and just not responding?	Text her: "Hey, I'm just not feeling the spark between us. You seem like a cool person, but it's just not there for me. I didn't want to pull the fade away, so here I am, taking responsibility for my feelings. Good luck finding someone else."	Don't pull the fade - it's really a dick thing to do. Be clear with her that you don't see this going further and don't waste any more time. It's never an easy conversation to have, but the person on the receiving end should appreciate the directness in the long run.
What are healthy women actually eating?	Why are you just asking a bunch of redditors? Did you expect one answer? If you want to learn how to eat healthy, every major medical organization in the world has basic guidelines. And those guidelines are all the same. They’ll vary in how they phrase it (“make half you plate fruits and veggies” vs “eat 5 cups of fruits and veggies a day”) but it’s universally the same basic advice. And frankly it’s what you know already. You KNOW when you’re eating junk food. You KNOW you should eat your greens. There’s no magic, just common sense.	I just try to make every meal at least 50% veggies, and the rest kind of falls into place. So breakfast might be a veggie scramble, or veggie frittata that I made earlier in the week and rewarm, or potatoes with veggies. If 50% of a meal is vegetable, it's hard to go wrong and you will likely be eating pretty healthy.
Guys who have been divorced, what was the day after the filing like?	I didn't know the day of filing I wasn't talking to my wife, but the day I got served my papers saying it was over was a day I was heading out on vacation with my very beautiful gf of the time. I was happy it was all over.	The day I got my certified copy of my finalized divorce decree and drove the second copy to my ex in-laws, they said they only time they ever saw me smile like that was when my son was born. I had some damn energy that day, and felt on top of the world. The actual day I filed though wasn't really anything special it was a long time coming and just a step along the way. When it was over... is where it was at for me.
What is a product you wouldn’t think works but actually does?	As naive as this probably sounds, a mousetrap. Until I was in college, I'd never needed a mousetrap before, but one day I suddenly needed one. I went to the drug store not knowing what I'd find, and the only option was the wood slab with a metal coil on it, like from an old cartoon. It didn't occur to me that that would still be an option, but I figured I might as well give it a try. It totally worked. Within ten minutes of setting it down with a glob of peanut butter on it, SNAP! The mouse was dead within 30 seconds. I salute you, inventor of the old-timey mousetrap, whomever you are. No one has bested you yet.	Good dry shampoo. I always assumed it wouldn't do much to help my hair and I now know that was a dark, greasy-haired time in my life.
What stereotype about men do you conform to?	I like my long term partners to have less sexual partners than I do... like A lot less. Can't explain it but I know its not because I hate women but in my experience girls who have only had sex with like less than 10 guys are just more compatible with me. maybe its just a coincidence but i haven't met a "promiscuous" girl that i clicked with anyway. And I tell them my number and they don't seem to mind so I guess if everyone's happy right? Oh I'm also super into sports like an unhealthy amount of time is spent learning BS that Ill probably never need.	Work outdoors with my hands in a relative high risk job. Preferred beverages are beers or whiskey. Two modes of transportation are truck or motorcycle. Very solitary person and happy with it.
[Possibly NSFW] Men, who is the creepiest guy you know? What makes him creepy?	For most guys I've heard called "Creepy" I would advise them to dress better and lose some weight, as it seems creepiness and attractiveness are inversely proportional.	I know a guy who graduated from HS last year who was 19. He would hang around underclassmen, especially those that owned a 3DS. Once he knew that you owned one he would latch onto you. Even if you didnt know him. He also would laugh at everything, not a haha type of thing. But a HEAHEAUGHA. He made any situation feel uncomfortable.
For anyone who meal plans/meal prep, what are you eating for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks this week?	Breakfast: scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, or cereal (bran flakes) Lunch: salad (carrot, cucumber, iceberg lettuce, chickpeas, corn) or soup! Dinner: teriyaki chicken or honey mustard chicken and veg (carrots, onions, pumpkin, cauliflower, cabbage)	We make smoothies for breakfast every morning. I bring grapes as a snack, and this week we made chili for lunch! It's finally feeling like fall here, which means it's crockpot season!
What is your hidden daily struggle?	Debating on what I want to do with the rest of my life. I want to go to graduate school. But for what? Psychology? Clinical research? Physician Assistant? I want to make good money, but have nice, normal hours. I also don't want to be in school for 6 more years or I would try for my MD. I am stuck.	I'm actually pretty good at my job. Which is good, because I don't have the focus to do it more than half of the work day.
How can I communicate to my friend that I'm into him and want to get physical?	1. Approach him 2. Say "Hey, I want yo dick" 3. Proceed to sexy times It really is that simple if you own a vagina.	>how can I subtly feel out if he wants it as badly as I do? I don't want to be too obvious in case I weird him out Fuck not this again. Here is a nugget of wisdom from the FAQ: >Be blatant. Extremely, blindingly blatant. Guys, particularly younger and nerdier guys, can be terrible at picking up at signals that seem obvious to you. Anything short of "want to come over and bang right now" can and will be misinterpreted.
What is the most psycho thing a girl has ever done to you?	We got linked to a few other subs, and the thread has run its course.......so we're locking this thread so it doesn't turn into a whiny shit show.

What's he fastest you've ever brought a man to orgasm? How did you do it?	As a guy (ignore username) sometimes I last a good 30min to an hour, other times I'm a two pump chump. I usually go down on her first, get her there, which takes the edge of performing solely for her, then we can just basque in the glory of mediocre to kinda good PIV (I kid, it's actually pretty hott). If I last a while, and get her off again during PIV, it's win win. If I last shorter than a trident commercial, she's turned on by how quickly she got me off and takes it as a compliment. Either way, high fives and cuddling take place after.	About a minute and a half. I have had them come quicker but this one made me the most proud. It was round two that night. We were in the spooning position and I was kegeling while twirling my hips. I just heard a lot of heavy breathing in my ear and he had a death grip on my hip, which made it super hot. I let out a moan and bam! He was done. He was embarrassed but I loved it. It was a huge ego boost.
Ladies from the African and Asian continents: where are you from and what do you think everybody should know about your country?	White people are from Africa too. My ancestors came to South Africa ~1661 from Germany/Netherlands. People love to occasionally tell me how I'm not African and should go back to Europe. Too bad Prussia doesn't exist anymore.	I was born in the Philippines (mom is Filipino, dad is Chinese). There's a large discrepancy between rich and poor. Lots of corruption in government, and popular culture emulates American popular culture (lots of selfies, make up, kids having "deep and profound" thoughts). The food is delicious albeit different from American food. Some parts are beautiful and the big cities have a lot of shopping. It's an inexpensive place to visit once you get there. The flight is expensive though.
How do I tell a guy I'm not going to orgasm?	"Hi, this doesn't have anything to do with you, but I'm not going to orgasm. I'm fine if you finish, don't worry about me."	>that I'm not going to orgasm This is ok and most guys have slept with a girl who was similar >and that I would honestly prefer that sex be over as fast as possible. this....is not going to go over well. Most men are ok with no orgasm but will probably feel like shit if you dont enjoy it at all.
What is a trait that makes you instantly dislike a person you are conversing with?	When someone stops talking to me to answer their phone, and I can tell they're annoyed at the person for calling. **The sound of a phone ringing does not constitute a requirement to answer**. You can let it go to voicemail and not interrupt our conversation.	People who talk at you instead of having a conversation. They only want to be heard and never seek to hear. They can be on a roll pontificating about whatever they are going on about, you can say, "I dress my penis like a tycoon from the 1920s" and they will go on like you haven't said anything. You realize after you have gotten away from them that they probably don't even know your name because they never even cared enough to ask.
How do you feel about girls who have had threesomes in the past, or been otherwise sexually adventurous?	I'm a woman but I've had this same conversation with my boyfriend and with several male friends and not one of them said that it made any difference to them whatsoever. Sounds like the same kind of guy who would say that if a woman has been with X number of guys she's no longer "girlfriend material". Very immature and insecure.	If you're sexually adventurous, then don't get all prudish because you want a serious relationship. Finding that kind of shit out will make anyone think "what's wrong with me that they don't want to explore sex with *me*?!" and that may turn to "those desires just didn't go away, so either I'm so repulsive that she can't have fun sex with me, or she's having fun sex with someone else" and thus kill that relationship. So, if you're sexually adventurous, then find someone else who is sexually adventurous and have lots of babies in a very freaky way. (Or don't have babies and just have freaky sex.)
Ending a friendzone relationship with a girl. Do I owe her an explanation?	No such thing as a "friendzone relationship", that's called a friendship. Yes, if you're ending a three year friendship you generally can't just cut off contact without explanation and expect her to accept it. If this is more of an acquaintanceship you could have done a more normal fade, but since you went straight for ignoring messages of course she has questions. IMO you should just explain that you still have feelings for her and think it would be best to try to move on.	"This relationship isn't healthy for me. I want more than friendship, and since you don't share those feelings with me, I think it's best if we cut contact. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to move past this. I've already made up my mind, but I feel that you deserve to know why. I wish you well." Be brief, but stern. Don't let her try and convince you to change your mind, either by flirting or shaming. Remember: You don't owe her your friendship, time, and attention similarly to how she doesn't owe you sex for being nice to her.
Men who married women who wore sweatpants with ‘Juicy’ on their ass, how did your marriage end up?	My (22M) girlfriend (21F) of 6 years, now fiance, wore the whole "Juicy" suits in high school. Her friends would coordinate when they would all wear the suits. We went to high school in the richest county in Northern America, so that explains that. Ever since we have given our lives to Christ and she has become an incredibly generous and compassionate soul- we frequently go on local and international mission trips to love those who need it! She has grown away, as have I, from the lifestyle we lived in high school towards a much more generous one, as modeled to us by Jesus Himself! Getting married in Jan. 2020, can't wait.	I didn't know my wife wore these in middle school till this post. Thank you for the very enlightening anniversary.
[Serious] What aspect of adulthood were you the least prepared for?	**Your post has not been removed, this is just FYI.** AskMen does not moderate for the [Serious] tag like AskReddit. If you are concerned about your question not being taken seriously, you may want to consider removing it and rewording it. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskMen) if you have any questions or concerns.*	How much it costs. You don't realize just how much your parents were paying to support you until you have to keep one human being alive (aka yourself) with nothing but your own income.
What can be done about people you have ghosted?	I was unaware anything ever needed to be done. Ghosting's fine. It keeps you distant, they can go full nuclear-meltdown on their own without threatening your life.	I'm always interested in how anti ghosting Reddit is. I've never once had a woman not ghost me, like I've never had a woman say something like "hey, not interested anymore, but good luck out there" and to be honest, I don't know if I'm just used to it now, but I'm not sure saying anything would be any different. Being ghosted is pretty clear, and if you liked the person it sucks, but so would any possible thing they could say. I get it's different for OP just because of the time frame, I'm talking first or second date. .
What game(s) should I get from the steam summer sale?	I got a vive, recently, and all I am playing these days is VR. So, if you have $800 to spend and a PC that can run it, I totally suggest getting a vive and then some sweet VR games ;)	Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games on steam, and it's on sale, Pillars of Eternity is an excellent RPG, but it's very old school, I just got Rise of the Tomb Raider, which I'm excited to start, and I've heard really good things about the new Doom. I'm probably not going to get that until Christmas, though because Overwatch is consuming my FPS life.
Have you noticed that friendships where you got really close really quickly, have a tendency to end badly?	I was just thinking about this! I have been burned a few times now, and I'm at the point where I have mostly guy friends. And I know ladies here hate when people say, "oh I hate drama, I don't have a lot of female friends," as they usually start the drama, but this is honestly true for me.	Yeah, I've been through this a couple of times. Learnt the hard way that the girl who hugs you within a couple of weeks and calls you her "best friend ever!" might not be the most stable and is likely to turn on a dime.
Aside from feminine goods, what supplies would make a good care package for homeless women?	If you take away all the feminine goods, then there's no need to differentiate between male and female homeless. In other words, socks.	Socks! Socks socks socks Deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste. I just know most shelters say they are in desperate need of socks and no one ever donates them
Do you enjoy being naked but don't enjoy seeing yourself naked?	I've gotten to the point where I'm okay with seeing myself naked because I'm okay with being naked and I don't feel like I need to apologize for, like, existing. I don't look in the mirror and think "GODDAMN WHAT A HOTTIE." But I also don't waste my time pinching and poking and ranking what I don't like from worst to least terrible. Life is short, nobody gives a damn about how my tummy folds.	I always love being naked, but whether or not I enjoy *seeing* myself naked largely depends on what kind of body image day I'm having. I usually enjoy it, but some days I just feel like a manatee.
Women who don't like your current partner but are still with them - what's your story? Where is the relationship heading?	To every top commenter: >Don't be scared to speak >Don't speak with someone's tooth >Don't bargain when you're weak >Don't take that sharp abuse >Some patients can't be saved >But that burden's not on you >Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that (10+x)	I feel like I'm the bad significant other in these threads. I've gained a good portion of weight and I'm a handful with my depression. I'm somewhat preparing mentally for my so to end things.
What has been your experience with "right person, wrong time" relationships?	I don’t believe in the whole “right person, wrong time” thing. It’s odd how people romanticize this so much, like you’re star-crossed lovers or something. We aren’t living in one of Shakespeare’s stories, this is real life. It’s not the “wrong time”, it’s the wrong person. Framing your incompatibility as the universe’s fault is just a coping method used by people who so desperately *want* a particular person to be the right one, when they just aren’t.	I found out 25 years too late that the man I was mad about also liked me. He only told me recently and it's been hard to come to terms with how different my life would have been had either of us said something as simple as, "I like you."
Gents, what is your worst dating horror story?	I asked out a girl to go to the movies one day. She wasn't particularly pretty, nor is she very charming...a solid 4.5, or a 5 on a good day. But you know what, I was having a dry spell and was getting desperate. Anyway, I guess she just wasn't used to having guys asking her out...so she said to meet at the movie theatre. "Ok..." I thought to myself. When I got there, I gave her a call and she said to meet her in the theatre. When I finally found her, I also found her friend sitting next to her. Who the fuck brings a friend to a date? I watched the movie, because I've already paid for the ticket, and peaced outta there. Couldn't believe I put in the effort of putting on a big boy shirt with buttons and collar for that.	We were supposed to have a movie and pizza date at my place ( well my parents, I was 17) I drive to the plaza order the pizza and go to blockbuster to get a couple of movies. Get home about half an hour later and look at the answering machine. 27 messages. All from her. The first was " I thought we were getting together tonight, where are you" and degraded to " you fucking prick , I thought I loved you." This was to be our second date.
Just had an idea stolen from me at work, have any other women here had their ideas "re purposed" away from them in the workplace?	At my old job, I asked a female mentor about this specific problem and she gave me some advice that I still think about today. She said that a lot of the time, having an idea ignored can be due to the way women present their ideas. As a disclaimer, I'm not to trying to say that this is the only reason our ideas get ignored or that women bear all the fault. Basically, women tend to speak more passively subconciously. Do you tend to use passive or "emotional" phrases, such as "I think..." or "I feel that..."?	Yes! Not too long ago. I teach at a college, and a close female colleague and someone I considered a friend asked, supposedly just in general conversation, if I had any ideas for a committee we both served on. I told her an idea I had been working on for a while, and, bizarrely, she wrote it down as I told her about it. At that point, I had a feeling she was going to poach, so I bluntly asked her not to bring it up at the committee meeting, and she agreed. Fast forward to the meeting the next day, first thing out of her mouth? My idea. She didn't even mention my name with it. She just basically pretended it was solely her idea that she had come up with all on her own. Needless to say, we're not friends anymore.
Women who look young -- how does it affect you in professional situations?	I'm a bartender and most people seem to think I'm 19. I'm actually 24. Customers sometime walk up to me and ask if I'm allowed to work behind the bar and I feel like some customers go easier on me when I screw uop just because they think I'm just a teenager. I kind of don't care that much, but it did annoy me quite a lot at the beginning. I was afraid that people wouldn't take me seriously, but it hasn't been the case so far.	I get stopped in the halls during class and yelled at. I have people yell "where is your teacher?!" When I'm sitting right there at the teacher's desk. I've had a security guard try and take my phone. I've gotten multiple threats to tow my car for parking in the faculty parking lot. The kids are constantly trying to find out if I party or smoke weed. I'm a high school substitute teacher and I'm 29. (I sub at multiple high schools so security/other teachers don't always recognize me) EDIT: I want to add that I love my job and most of the time I don't get yelled at, I just have gotten yelled at before, for being in the halls during class time before or for sitting at the teachers desk or parking in the faculty lot.
Besides medication and therapy what other things helped you through depression?	I lost my shit on lexapro and quit that shit real fast. I enjoyed reading a whole bunch. Creative workbooks were really fun for me. I also did this thing called "tapping" where I tapped on my temples, wrists, hands and would close my eyes to just feel that sensation. And being outside barefoot. Feeling the elements really centered me.	Break things down and write a plan. "Clean a bedroom" is too much to think of sometimes if you're severely depressed. So instead, you write down 'vaccuum' and that's what you do. In the words of Kimmy Schmidt, you can stand anything for ten seconds.
People who have broken down in public before, what happened?	Gender dysphoria. Some years before I realized I was trans, I was on a ski slope. Skiing scared me a bit, but I kept telling myself I can do this, and to "man up" and get off the bunny slope. I did, kept trying to psyche myself up in that fashion and had a dysphoria/panic attack in front of my family. That sucked.	My son was about 9 months old and we were in Target. A sweet little old lady approached him, cooed over him, said how handsome he was and generally made a fuss. She then squished his little hand in hers and said “you look like you need a grandma, I could do that.” My mom had passed away when my son was 3 months old. I went from normal to full on sobbing in about two seconds, to the point I lost a contact and smudged mascara all over this sweet little woman’s jacket.
Do you sleep talk? Does your partner? If so, what have you said or heard?	I do occasionally. I usually just laugh - sometimes for lengthy periods of time - but my fiance says I've said things a handful of times. He says he will talk back to me and sometimes I'll say something again. I've woken myself up laughing a few times which is kind of a weird feeling at first - I usually wake up confused about why I'm sleeping and laughing. My sister was the first one to point out that I laugh in my sleep years ago. I woke up her to asking me what was so funny and why was I laughing so hard.	Boyfriend talks in his sleep a lot. The best was when I was on my side facing away from him (awake) and all of a sudden he rolls over and starts grabbing my shoulder saying "titty...titty titty" followed by a slight pause when I think he realized that it wasn't a boob. Then in a confused/disappointed voice goes "...titty?". Right back to sleep. *Edit: I fucking misspelled "titty". How dare I.
Those of you who have been on dates with redpillers/PUA/super sexists douchebags, how did it go ?	I have to ask, what is a reppiller and/or PUA? I have never heard that before. I am a guy just being nosey since this hit the front page?	Yeah, there was this guy that I kinda dated for a while. Not only did he neg me all the time (that was before I even knew what negging was), I found out through mutual friends that he was telling everyone he was only dating me because, and I quote, "Depressed girls put out so easily". I proceeded to break things up before ever sleeping with him, so there's that.
What is your go-to Chess opening?	I like to start out with a fat bongrip. After that I just stare down my mate until he reminds me I could start because I'm white and just go with the flow from there.	Stare down your opponent, get in their heads, be sure to smell bad to throw off their game, use a slightly crooked board to mess up their rhythm, have a mosquito sound playing in the background to subconsciously annoy them over time. Psychological warfare is the name of the game
What are some things you hate to see in women's dating profiles?	Guys, 'love to travel' is vaginese for 'I'm a golddigger/freeloader/leech/parasite. I don't have a career nor a decent job. Just gimme lots of money!' 'I'm stubborn/headstrong.' Yeh, be proud of the sucker you'll land. Bye now! 'Oh and guys that approach me, don't do sunglasses/sandals/motorbike, just a wink ugh... etc.' That's just fembragging meaning 'I'm so popular!'	I dont know if anyone else has noticed, but, I frequently see women bragging about how much of a bitch they are in their Tinder bios. Cant stand it.
Online Daters of r/AskWomen, what are some of your favorite icebreaker lines that you've received?	Ask about the latest Netflix original series or the latest pop culture event. For example, if he thinks Trump won the debate, you know to look elsewhere.	The only 'line' that I enjoyed was one guy who messaged me saying 'does it ever bother you that lobsters are immortal?' It definitely started a conversation about harnessing lobster genes to create a team of immortal super mutants. It ended up not going anywhere for other reasons. Otherwise my now fiancé messaged me asking who my favorite Sailor Moon character was. It was from my profile and wasn't the usual barrage of 'hi sexy' crap.
Men, do you find navel piercing hot? Why?	Women with them are often times slutty in nature, and I don't find them attractive. I don't like piercings for the most part, and tattoos were always a dealbreaker for me. I just find it to be low-class.	Depends on the tummy that's got it, and on the style of piercing. Navel piercings can definitely be a turn on on the right woman, and a turn off on the wrong woman. The surrounding clothes and tattoos make a difference, too.
Women who have lost weight or become otherwise more attractive, how did your life change?	I am a bit depressed at the moment, so I have put on about 5kg. I am heading towards being overweight, but I guess it is a wall to protect myself. When I was skinnier I had more confidence and men treated me nicer, and prettier girls wanted to be my friend. I am guessing it is my confidence as well.	I lost about 70 pounds a few years ago. I had birthed 4 children and had been overweight in some capacity for around 10 years. How did my life change? Everybody thought I *must* be having an affair. Thanks assholes....
My younger sister is becoming extremely promiscuous. How am I meant to handle the situation?	Stop slut shaming your sister. CIS-HET PATRIARCHAL SHITLORD No but seriously, nothing you can do. Let her be a drip-dry whore for all you give a fuck.	If I were you, I'd actually focus my worry less on the promiscuity itself (because yeah, she has the right to fuck who she wants), and I'd be a little more worried about anything underlying all of this behavior, drinking included. It's possible that she's feeling lonely, or having self-esteem problems, or something. OR maybe she just loves to fuck/get male attention. Regardless, it might be worth saying, "Hey sis, I support you no matter what, and I just want to let you know if there is anything you ever want to talk about, I'm here for you. I hope life is going well for you." Maybe that'll open up an avenue for her to talk, and if it doesn't, there isn't much you can or should do.
Ladies who have kids: what is on your children's Christmas wish list? And are they going to get what they want?	Don't tell the Santa lie to start with and your kids wont have unrealistic expectations. Mine is 8. He knows Mommy will do what she can for presents. He is super appreciative and doesn't complain.	My kids are 2 and 3. We do “something you want, something you need, something to wear, something to read”. Saves us from spending a fortune. With all the gifts they get from other family, underneath the tree is still plenty full.
From the male point of view, how can you tell that a female friend is attracted to you?	well as we men do not have female friends for the sake of friendship we can tell when they let us hit...actually pretty easy	They'll tell you several years later. Edit: Wow, two golds. I want to thank my mama, Vikki, Kari, Lauren, and Dani. Without these special girls life would be much less confusing.
Women with a different sex drive than your partner, how do you find balance?	I am newly divorced and mismatched sex drives was a big part of it. Ideally, I would have sex every day or every other day. Ideally, he would have sex every 3-4 months. He was diagnosed with low testosterone and tried a gel treatment that didn't work for him. The doctor said it doesn't work for everyone and that testosterone injections are more effective and cheaper. Hubby wouldn't try it because "ew, needles." Low testosterone also has other side effects such as depression and weight gain, both of which were also big issues he was having. He couldn't/wouldn't get these things under control and we divorced this summer after 11 years together. I am sad that it didn't work out, but I'm much happier now that I'm not getting crushed under the weight of his depression. And I'm also getting laid much more. That's nice too.	There is no big issue about it but I'm always down for sex and he needs to be *feeling good*. Like if he's stressed or hasn't exercised or is tired he just doesn't want to. He's quite apologetic about it, which of course he doesn't need to. It can be a little frustrating sometimes, but I'm thankful we have such a great relationship I don't even remotely take it personally. Plus, he said he's always happy to get me off and that by the time he does he wants me anyway...I'm always too hesitant though because how can you say to someone who's clearly not in the mood, hey can you just finger me for a bit lol. BUT that exact situation happened the other day and it was rather excellent so I think I'm in the future I'm just gonna ask when I want it.
What would you go back and tell your 22 year old self?	Don’t bother going to grad school for music, you’ll never have a career in it, just get a diploma in computers instead or something.	Look after yourself. Doing your best does not mean exhausting yourself to the point where you cant function. Listen to your own needs, instead of letting everyone else tell you what they are.
If any, what are some problems you face while being under a female boss as opposed to a male boss?	In my career I've had two female bosses. Both were incredibly hard working, professional and generally a joy to work with as long as you work hard and do what is expected of them. The six or so male bosses have been an absolute mixed bag, mostly of bad habits and being in positions that they don't deserve. After a while I found that getting on with them and getting praise was less of what I did and more of how I did it and how I played them. So in summary from my experiences female bosses are problematic if you enjoy success in the work place from playing games rather than by doing a good job.	My male boss was a jack ass but he was a jack ass to your face,my female boss is a jack ass behind your back .
What did you do for your 30th birthday?	I went to a hotel with five close friends. We got day drunk and ate a lot and listened to music and went swimming in the hot tub. We went out downtown drinking and dancing. It was a lot of fun!	I went to Alaska—my goal was to visit all 50 states by my 30th birthday & it was the last one. I spent some time in Denali & Seward and took a day-long cruise on the Kenai Fjords on my birthday. I went home a couple days later & my best friend flew in to visit for a long weekend.
Which character on Bob's Burgers do you identify with the most, and why?	As much as I have a sense of disdain for the show, I've had like six different people tell me that I reminded them of Gene. It's just the type of humor I have and the way I say things.	I wish I was Louise, or even Tina or Bob, but I'm becoming more of a Linda every day. I've started saying "Crackers, you're comin' with me!" when I grab my saltines for night snack.
Why do so many guys talk to me about not being able to get a girl yet never think to put any time into their appearance?	How much time should I have to put into my appearance? Aren't I "born this way"? Isn't it "all about the base"? Aren't I "perfect just the way I am"? It's a rather annoying double standard where "real women have curves" but "dad bods" are hideous and laughable. It's the same thing with "I don't date short men" being 100% socially acceptable, when there's nothing the guy can do about it but "I don't date fat chicks" is shallow and offensive when they absolutely could do something about it. Maybe he doesn't have time to work out more, maybe he can't afford to whiten his teeth, maybe he likes his haircut. Maybe he's happy the way he is, why does he have to change for a girl?	>I want to tell my guy friends this but not in a mean way. I think you answered your own question. Nobody wants to tell them because nobody wants to be mean, and they never find out.
Anything creepy or unexplained happen to you lately?	Started seeking God again lately, went back to church this Sunday. Felt really good. Starting fresh again. I need guidance in my life right now. But I've been having really creepy dreams. Last night I had a dream, I was at a friends house with a few other people, and I felt the presence of demons all around me. They were possessing my friends, and when they tried to posses me I told them that they couldn't because I had Christ in my heart. I think Gods trying to tell me I'll be alright with everything that's going on in my life. Coincidence? I don't think so.	This morning I woke up an hour earlier than normal to go to work. I had been hoping to go for a run before work, but I ended up passing out on the couch instead. I woke up at 0500 hearing a small kid crying. My youngest is 4 years old now and this was a newborn sound. I wandered all over the house listening to this before figuring it out as being outside our front door. I stumbled outside and the noise shut off like a light switch. None of my neighbors have newborns, so I assume it was an animal of some type. I hope.
What is the point of a strip club? Is it really worth it to spend a shitton of money just to be frustrated?	Strip clubs are fun in a group. Don't get suckered into the champagne room, spend less than a few hundred tipping out the main stage and a few lap dances. Then get out and hit the club/bar for some skanks to get your D wet for real. It's the appetizer round.	I only go to strip clubs with a group of friends. Normally, some guys and some girls. We are all drunk and just looking to have a good time. And honestly, do you get blue balls just every time you get an erection or something? You know you don't have to get a dance if you don't want to.
Have you ever experienced something that seemed small or insignificant at the time but actually ended up having a profound impact on your life?	I hate cleaning my room. I changed to cleaning room 2 times a week before I have girl friend and now my gf like to stay with me in my room. U know the rest.	I convinced my mom to take me to a fan convention for a tv show I liked when I was a teenager. Through connections I made there I got my first internship, which turned into my first job (where I had a wealth of amazing experiences), which is where I met my future husband and through my first job I got my current job at my dream company in my dream industry that as a teen I never thought I’d get a chance to work in. Who’d a thunk being a super nerdy teen would have lead me to an incredible career and an amazing SO.
Living with my best friend just turned into a nightmare. Tell me your roommate horror stories?	I had a roommate who was a DJ (I'm sure you can fill in the rest) Additionally: He slept all day and spent the nights watching movies on his speakers (for some reason he REALLY liked Django Unchained and Drinking Buddies) Bonus: one weekend (I usually went home for the weekend but instead went to a friend's house and came back the next day) I found that he ate MY FOOD in MY BOWL and hadn't bothered to clean it. :/	I had an awful male roommate for a while. He refused to pay his part of any bills and constantly ate my food. He tried to convert me to christianity constantly (I grew up christian, but I'm agnostic). That was bad enough, but then he started getting creepy. My panties started going missing. He ate my food, even when I told him not to. Then one day I came home and went to do yoga, and stepped in cum. He had cum on my yoga mat. I lost it. He was evicted shortly after that. I found all my missing panties, crusty, behind his bed.
What is the most valuable thing you learned in therapy?	I've learned quite a bit in my time in therapy, and one of the things that's really helped me deal with a lot of internal self-hate is just separating that as a thought of, this is not true, this is just one negative thought that doesn't outweigh the overall general and positive experiences that show otherwise. As much as I really don't like myself some days, I have to remember that and it's really helped me.	The oxygen mask concept. Basically you have to put on your own “mask” first by improving your mental health and doing what’s best for you before you can assist others and help them with their lives. Really made me take a step back from getting involved in other people’s problems because it wouldn’t benefit me or my health.
What’s the biggest signal you didn’t pick up on?	I had a girl over for about an hour to "watch the office" but I didn't know if she was 100% into me so I let it go on for a while until she said that she should probably leave. Then I decided "fuck it", made a move, then fucked her. After a decent amount of time where I wasn't sure if she wanted to fuck or not. Good times.	A couple years ago via snapchat convo: --- **Her**: Remember back in high school? You used to throw pennies at me and call me your "penny whore", good times... **Me**: Hahaha yeah, sorry about that, I thought you found it funny **Her**: I did think it was funny! I liked it a lot... **Me**: Oh okay good, I was kinda worried, I was a major douche back then **Her:** It's okay, I can still be your penny whore if you want... **Me:** Eh, probably wouldn't work, pennies aren't legal tender anymore hahaha --- She then proceeded to stop talking to me, met a guy at her university, and they've been together ever since. Still beating my head against the wall for that one.
Men who need a lot of physical affection, how do you cope when you're single ?	I'm that way too. I cope by finding things to take up my time and distract me like hobbies and work. And going out with my friends who tend to be affectionate. Also, you know that you can have sex while being single, right?	Naturally a needy male, 25 y/o, haven't had a legit gf my entire life. No sex. In 5 years, I'll become a wizard, which is nice
What do you think is men's number 1 issue that should be adressed?	I'm not trying to hate on women, it men's rights need to be addressed. Women everywhere are wanting equality and think women are being oppressed, but completely ignore it if it's a man being oppressed. If a man complained about the things women and feminists complain about, they would never be taken seriously. If women complain about it, BuzzFeed makes another fucking article explaining why men are such assholes that need to be stopped immediately.	Mental health, probably. Men are 3.5x as likely as women to fucking kill themselves. That's a bit of a problem.
Do you ever feel like you're living a mediocre life? And how does it make you feel?	I bet if you asked a woman from a third world country where women don’t have property, are at risk of kidnap, rape, slavery, etc or don’t have reproductive choices, you might reconsider what a mediocre life really means.	Yes. It makes me feel pretty bad. I'm 31, and I guess as a teenager I felt like I could do anything, there were so many possibilities, but now it feels like I'm sort of coasting and haven't really achieved anything and maybe never will :(
What is the most annoying humblebrag you've ever heard?	I'm more annoyed by petty jealousy than if someone is feeling good about themselves. In my book, go ahead, brag, feel good about yourselves. You earned it, or even if not, you got it.	"You cannot imagine what a bore it is, having to go to the Caribbean again. Now that the villa is paid off, it would be criminal not to go on holiday there, but it's gotten old. You're so lucky not to have a second house, it's nothing but a headache." My sister's brilliant insight.
What's the most annoying thing a woman interested in you did?	I started talking to this chick, and was into her then she said she thought 50 Shades of Grey was a good movie and that she also wanted to see Hot Tub Time Machine 2. Killed it for me.	Pouted like a child, had a mini tantrum/huff puff session when I had to go. It almost would have been cute/acceptable if she wasn't dead serious about it like I just took her toy away.

[Serious] mothers of Reddit, do you ever regret having kids and why?	No I have never regretted having my kids, and enjoy my life more with them now. We are all into a routine, eat healthy, me and my husband hardly drink anymore. We try to keep weekends free to do family stuff. Also my age gap rule was, not to have a 2nd child until the 1st is toilet trained. There was no way I was changing 2 sets of shitty nappies. My eldest was so independent when the baby arrived which made life a lot easier. It’s definitely fun having little people running around the house.	Several times a day. I also swell with love for them several times a day. I like my kids, I don’t like momming.
What kind of date would you prefer to be taken out on if a girl asked you out?	"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach" Just talking over dinner sounds like a great first date	Take me to the zoo or aquarium. I am totally a geek when it comes to animals. It's a lot of walking and talking, so we get to know each other. And if the conversation putters out, welp, we're at the zoo and penguins are hilarious.
When you "read between the lines" on somebody's dating profile, what do you really see?	"These days I'm more interested in staying in and watching Netflix then going out partying all night." I used to be super sexually adventurous and had sex with a staggering number of partners. Now I want to "settle down" with a guy who will support me and be satisfied with once a week starfish sex.	"I love to laugh"/"I love to have fun"/"I love to travel"/Emoji Spam - I'm too lazy to fill out a dating profile, so I rely on cliches to pad length like a poorly written high school essay.
How comfortable are you with your breast size?	This is a really interesting question. Coming from a guy that likes boobs, confidence plays a huge part in how they're received. Size isn't everything. Rock what you have.	I have bitty boobies. I am 89% comfortable with them. LOTS of benefits - most bras work, can sleep and run comfortably, less unwanted staring, clothes fit and are mostly flattering. I wish they were a teensy bit bigger, all things equal, but I'm otherwise content
Single ladies, what is your sex life like?	My sex life consisted entirely of a FWB. I've only slept with one person, and it was within that context. I don't have a sex life any more and I will continue to not have a sex life until I meet another person I can establish a relationship with (either romantic or FWB), or else until my ex-FWB is off the market again. I wouldn't have sex with someone I didn't know, so ONSs are off the table for me. I can't pretend to know what the norm is, though.	I feel the best way to explain my sex life would be to show you all the receipts from buying batteries. Edit: I can't spell
What do you think of "Living Apart Together" (LAT) relationships?	Seems like a fantastic waste of financial resources to maintain two residences. Fiscally moronic. If you can't live with your partner then they are probably not the right partner.	My ultimate dream is to buy a duplex and knock out an inner wall to create one giant living room with my side and his side houses. It's two houses in one!
Would you prefer a nuclear war or zombie post-apocalypse situation? Why?	Zombies. Wait is my family immune. Well were all fucked either way. Zombies I guess. Zombie tits. That's not incest. I mean necrophilia rite?	I'm going with zombies. With a nuclear apocalypse, the water supply is fucked and you have radiation everywhere so you have to wear a hazmat suit and deal with the possibility of your offspring being born with 6 limbs and 3 eyes. With zombies, you just have to stay away from/kill the zombies and hope you don't get bitten.
Why are there so many lonely guys out there?	Because women suck, that's why I'm single and have been all my life; so far. Only 20. I'm a desperate, anxious, self-loathing, misogynistic, piece of shit person and I blame it on feminism and the overall misandry in this world, specifically in the U.S. Women have no feelings, have no sympathy/empathy for others; especially men, and are selfish part of the species. Men go on being rejected and no body cares, the moment a woman gets rejected, she gets her own damn tv show made about it, it's ridiculous. Oh yeah....screw women's problems, sick of hearing about their shit when I've got; men have got, their own problems.	For me is not about dating, it's about the fact that for my entire life, nobody has invited me to anything. Not to hangout, not to play sports, not to a birthday party or any other party or anything. I always have to invite myself. After a while it gets to the point where you realize that nobody really cares if you are around or not. Every stage of my life has been like this and to me, that makes me feel incredibly lonely.
What's hard about dating you?	I'm never going to live with you. I'm never going to marry you. I'm never having kids. Most of my friends are women, and some of them are attractive. I watch porn. If you feel insecure or jealous, I'll reassure you, but I'm not making ANY changes to my behavior unless it's objectively wrong or causing a real-world problem. I'm going to expect you to adult-up and get over it and if you can't or won't, I will think less of you. I REALLY enjoy being single, so I have no motivation to deal with baggage, hangups, or games. If being with you is a chore, I'll walk away. I bake and cook. A LOT. If you're diabetic, trying to stay skinny, or trying to lose weight, you should stay well clear of me.	I have 'off' periods where I grow distant, need my own space and just don't really feel like talking to you or anyone else, really. It doesn't mean I've lost interest in you, either - it's just that sometimes having my shield emotional invulnerability down for so long in the presence of you drains me. That is a 100% on me and is ridiculous, but I know that in the context of a relationship, this bizarre hot and cold behaviour is maddening enough to want you to walk away and I wouldn't blame you.
What is your advice for two lesbians about to look after a 14yr old boy who has no real male role model?	a. Random boners happen. b. If you're attractive, he will masturbate while thinking of you. c. Make sure to teach him how to treat others, particularly women. Talk to him about girls, and how he should be honest with them and treat them like people - not just stuff to jerk off thinking about, and objects to have sex with. d. Remind him that strength isn't being loud and picking fights, its not having to.	DO NOT SHAME/MAKE FUN OF HIM IF HE MENTIONS A GIRL. PLEASE. Don't take and use information like that, even if you just think it's silly and funny. Makes the kid self-conscious and he'll just stop telling you stuff. Seriously. Can't tell how many times I told my mom "Hanging out with (female friend), be back later" and had them make 'silly' comments for weeks afterwards. Let him have his privacy. If he wants you to know about it, he'll TELL YOU.
Ladies who believe women shouldn’t feel societal pressure to shave but continue to do so yourselves, what is your motivation to continue making this effort?	I like how it looks (the same way I like curly hair, this doesn't mean I want everyone to have curly hair)	I like the way it looks and feels. And it doesn’t take a huge amount of time. I don’t think it’s any of my business what other women do.
Girls who like to workout. What is the most uncomfortable situation you've been in at a gym?	WOW, Im shocked, 159 comments, and not ONE of them about a trans woman in a locker room? Is everyone here from North Carolina? Shocked, SHOCKED I say! /s	I worked out at the local stripper gym because it was the closest to my house and open 24 hours. (Stripper gym because the guy who owned tons of local strip clubs bought all of his dancers memberships there, so there were always tons of exotic dancers there working out.) I made it about 6 months before canceling my membership because a lot of the men working out there felt very free to comment on, approach, or touch the women working out there. Sure, lots of those guys got kicked out by management, but it seemed like there were always dozens more ready to take their place. It sucked, though, because the women are all very sweet and supportive of each other.
How often have you encountered a woman who was selfish or boring in bed?	Upper 20's here. I can't bang a sandbag unless I'm really thirsty and need to get one out. That's what constitutes as boring to me. If the girl is just sexing to sex, good for her. Not enough for me anymore. In respect to the above statement, I'm absolutely done with shy girls. I often took the initiative on reserved girls expecting a sexually discerning, but repressed mindset eager to unleash some pent up energy. ( that's why I was shy, at first) Too many of them are in fact, human fleshlights with no idea how to navigate the sexual experience. Worse, lacking the courage to even try to be sexually empowered. Even the tightest of the bunch isn't worth wading through their social ineptitude. It sucks putting in the work, successfully getting laid, only to feel like you didn't get any at all.	50/50. One was a complete starfish, laid on her back and told me : "Make me cum". I was just finished telling her I was a virgin, but apparently, men have received a complete handbook on life since age 15 so I've should have known. Another one could only do missionary, did not want to try anything else. Boring as hell.
Which "signs that a girl likes you" are absolute horseshit?	Blow jobs. Just cause she blows you doesn't mean she likes you. She could be bored or just a pity blow.	Eye contact. I understand it to an extent but I don't think anyone should rely heavily on that as a sign. If people are comfortable in a conversation generally there is eye contact.
What's the latest movie that made you go "holy shit!"?	I started reading this post because I wanted to collect some new movies to watch... Not new movies and spoilers on recently released movies. Thanks.	Just got done watching The Prestige a little while ago. That movie is a devastating mind fuck (in the best way possible). YOU DON'T KNOW?!
What is the quickest amount of time you've went from introducing yourself to having sex? How and what kind of setting? Was your mindset different than usual?	15 months. I met her a party my friend was throwing. Met her again about 14 months later and asked her out. After a few weeks of dating, we had sex. The only other person I've had sex with I was friends with for 3 years before we got in a relationship. I ended up marrying both of them.	About an hour. Met on tinder, explicitly to hook up, the hour was mostly for a couple of drinks and to check nobody was a psychopath. My mindset was... usual I guess? More interesting was probably my mindset after. I didn't really enjoy the experience for some reason - I think the transnational nature of it made it a lot less fun than a one night stand with someone you meet in a club. It might have been my relative sobriety, but it felt a lot more grimy and I've been trying to avoid it ever since. When you meet someone in a bar/club you can have an evening before you get there. There is build up and tension that is then usually satisfyingly (or not) released - rather than a mechanical process.
Other than "nothing", what is the sexiest outfit you have ever seen a woman wear (in person)?	My ex had a perfect little body. She was shaped perfectly and had awesome muscle tone. She had a tight form fitting white dress with blue and green horizontal stripes at the top. The dress went all the way to her ankles so there was no skin showing except her arms. My god, she wore that on our first date and I could get nothing else out of my mind for the next month and a half. We went to some shitty bar and some dude grabbed her ass and I honestly couldn't blame him. I was fuming mad... but I understood.	A regular green bikini top and bottom. You know how in lame movies sometimes a group of husbands or whatever are all just sitting around by the pool and then their wives come out in swimsuits and the camera goes into slow-mo on them walking, some generic 80's arena rock starts playing, and the guys all lean in and tip their sunglasses down? Maybe one of them says "Daaaaamn" or some cheesy line? Yeah, that's how it felt when she came out. Damn, that girl was hot and she knew it.
Gentlemen. What do you NOT give a fuck about?	Feminism in developed western nations. At this point it feels like they're fighting based on a ton of strawman arguments and misconceptions. Yes, I have a cock so maybe "I just don't get it", but seriously whatever "oppression" women in these nations seem to be suffering is fucking extremely minor at most (from a population stand point) and I'd argue it's starting to have a net negative effect. I can see the relevance 15-20 years ago. Not anymore. The media time and energy spent on feminism could be better spent on a million other issues today. Maybe I do give a fuck...	The private lives of almost every celebrity ever. I genuinely struggle to understand the fascination, it just doesn't interest me one iota. Edit: I guess a lot of people agree with me.
Do you wish you had more hugs in your life?	I'm not a touchy person and I get really awkward when saying bye to people and don't know if I'm supposed to go in for the hug or not. When they're from people I'm close to though, I love them. I was really upset the other day and my boyfriend gave me a huge hug, and it made everything feel that much better.	We had a welsh dude at our work for a while, if you were in a bad mood you got a hug. Like a proper hug. I miss that guy.
Men who've grown up in cultures where women are often seen topless, are boobs still sexual for you?	Sexual attraction is why human females have permanently enlarged breasts, which is an exception in the animal world. IOW, boobs are innately sexualized.	I've seen quite a few boobs and been to quite a few topless beaches. It all depends on context to me. If I'm in a sexually arousing situation and I see tits, they turn me on. If not, and if I'm at the beach, seeing someone breastfeed or just changing a shirt, then I'm not typically aroused.
Can you explain the difference between "dating", "casual dating", "fwb relationship", "seeing someone" in American culture?	Oh man. Welcome to dating in America, which basically means everyone just fucks everyone without regards to people's feelings so in a nutshell that's pretty much it. The silver linings between the scenarios you describes are so thin that people just cross them all the time. Dating has definitely changed quite a lot	I think you'll find that many Americans can't agree on what those terms mean, which is why it's important for (non)couples to be clear about where they stand. "Dating" to one person might be the same as "casual dating" or even "fwb" to another person.
What was that moment when you were like "aaaaand definitely going to break up with you"?	When she told me she didn't want me to become the president of my Unis gaming club because it would take too much of my time. Ignoring the fact it was my dream job and I had been wanting it for over a year and a half.	When she had quit her third job in 3 months because her boss was some version of out to get her. Girl, there is a pattern here and it's you. I can't pay your half of the rent for the next six months.
I see it all the time on r/askmen but are there girls out there who have been completely oblivious to signs of interests from guys?	Definitely. But when I look back on it now, I think it's often been with Nice Guys™. You know, the ones who do their best to ingratiate themselves to you *just as friends*, and eventually get pissed off with you when you don't fall into their arms once you've magically realised that they've been *there for you all this time* while other guys are just assholes. The problem is that they intentionally presented themselves as 'just a friend' to me. The point when I realised they were interested was usually when they eventually got pissed off that I wasn't dating them yet.	It's not so much that I'm oblivious, but I don't trust that men are actually interested in me unless they both directly say they are AND act in a way that makes their interest obvious. I have a little bit of an ugly duckling complex, and even though I think that objectively I'm not bad-looking and I'm a fun person to be around, I'm pretty insecure about guys putting me in either the just friends or just sex buddies category because I'm not pretty enough or interesting enough to hold their interest long-term. Which means that unless a man outright says "I want to date you" and then plans a date, I assume he's just interested in friendship or casual sex.
What tips would you give to a Sikh boy going to the barber for the first time?	The barber has his own arcane rituals. He will make a move and you must match it to the poised finger. While you two dance ever closer, he will turn but you mustn't. With his back exposed, charged him and pinion his arms. Gently whisper in his ear, so no one can intrude: "cut my hair, good barber, and you will be handsomely rewarded. I am your prince, you see	If your hair is still long, donate it! You'll be doing a good cause and a lot of places will do the haircut for free if you're donating hair.
What societal pressures are there on men to 'man up'?	Sex. Men dont get sex if we dont man up. Basically women use sex as a reward. Power of the pussy etc. Pussy dries up fast when men start crying. On the other hand, a girl crying can get us hard i.e dont worry we'll save you etc. You should check out a book called The Manipulated Man by Esther Vilar (a woman surprisingly enough) written about 40 years ago on how this dynamic works. Or, The Great Female Con, or Sexploytation, or The Predatory Female or quite a few blogs and forums which discuss this stuff.	The general idea is this. If a man's down or in a bad place, it means he's a failure or has failed in some way. You must man up and not complain. When people see a man who can't handle something, their first reaction is disgust. If a woman's down or in a bad place, it means she's a victim. People simply do not hold women to the same level of responsibility. When people see a woman who can't handle something, their first reaction is empathy.
"Are you single? I have a son who is around your age..." Has this ever happened to you?	Yes and it was very awkward. You should let your parents know that asking women out for you is pretty creepy and it shows a lack of confidence.	My mom does this all the time! "How old are you? My daughter here goes to [College]! Do you have a girlfriend?" I feel like crawling into a hole and dying. I feel so bad for the waiter or person, too, and usually mouth "I'm sorry" to them when my mom looks away.
Men, how do I flirt?	I always think flirting is just talking about other stuff when you both understand that you wanna fuck. Obviously it's not quite as black and white as that but that's it at it's simplest. Anything more than that could still be flirting (like actually talking about wanting to fuck) but in my opinions you are more into "hitting on" territory there.	Make her laugh, but don't be a clown or comedian. Poke fun at her (not negging but playful teasing), easy things would be their hometown or college they attended. Don't straight up insult them, I'm only stressing this because some people like to take advice too literally. Make physical contact when it's acceptable and appropriate. Don't grab your coworker's ass and come back here whining about why you got slapped and fired. Don't send those kind FB messages again. Yikes. In fact, I steer clear of FB messages in general. If I'm not comfortable texting a girl, I'm definitely not telling her she's beautiful via FB message.
What are some SEXIST attitudes women hold without knowing?	Depends what you mean by sexist. According to feminists men can't experience sexism. Edit: Whoa, whoa, I didn't invent feminism, I'm just telling you what they believe.	I'd like to add the assumption that women are these complex and mysterious creatures which are impossible to understand. Similarly men are simple and only need their basic needs covered. I suppose it's perpetuated by both sexes but it has bugged me for a long time.
Men, what do you hate about dating and what’s the hardest quality to find in a woman?	>What do I hate most about dating? I'm coming to the realization that it's a giant waste of time. A lot of women are not worth the effort. There's a reason why marriage rates keep declining, the juice isn't worth the squeeze. So my current solution is fucking them and discarding them when they overstay their welcome. >Whats the hardest quality to find in a woman? Loyalty.	Basically my standards for a girlfriend went from "does she give me a boner?" To "do I see myself seriously dating and maybe falling in love with this girl?" This has basically made me single for a while because I won't just jump into a relationship for the sex anymore. I think the hardest part of dating at 25 vs high school is that I'm not forced to go to a place and take class everyday with girls around me. I have to go out and find them.
Lesbians who used to date men, what was it like?	Everyone, please keep in mind this post (and this sub really) is about asking people for their experiences. This means not arguing with commenters, no playing "well what about the men?", no asking extremely invasive questions. Thanks.

Ladies, has anyone dropped everything and moved far away on a whim? If so, how did it turn out?	Just booked a one way flight for the end of the month! A little nervous but more excited than anything. I'm leaving behind an awesome roomate/bff, parents, and a good but new relationship. I feel like I need this change and my main motivations were frustration with my decent paying but dead-end job and my love for traveling.	Hey there! I got a teaching job in England and my hubby and I left both our jobs and moved from Alberta to Cambridge for 9 months. The visa process was pretty smooth. Opening a bank account and apartment hunting was interesting and a bit stressful. We found the first two weeks were pretty stressful with trying to make everything perfect. But after that we got settled, made friends, and traveled... a lot! I would give it a go! Good luck :)
My sister dropped a pizza FACE DOWN on the ground. What petty shit will you NEVER FORGIVE someone in your life for?	[Insert hyperbolically sarcastic way of suggesting that your friend is worse than Hitler by scientific notationesque orders of magnitude here.]	My sister and I were sharing a piece of key lime pie, and it was the best damn pie I've had in my entire life. I split the last piece in two to share it fairly, but as I was lifting it to my mouth it fell off the fork and she reached over and stole my piece!!! This was over a decade ago and I'm still pissed , sometimes she brings it up to try to convince people that I was in the wrong for flipping out but they see right through it
Was your SO "there for the futon and instant noodles?" How did she support you if so? How do you express your gratitude now that things are better?	I had just finished a divorce, all I had for furniture was a dresser and and an office chair. We met, stayed together for 4.5 years - moved 2 hours away for work and survived 2 years of long distance. In the end, she supported me taking a job 2 states away and the distance out an end to things before she could move with me. Now make 3x what I did when we met, have much nicer things and money isn't what caused her to stay for so long or to leave in the end. Actual plot twist - shortly after the initial partner of 4.5 years and I broke up, I met someone at work and am now getting married in November. Much different experience in some ways versus my "rags to riches" experience.	My dad’s wife was. He’s really well off now and she’s younger and skinny and blonde so she catches a lot of assumptions. She was there from the black Astro van and shag brown carpet to the Porsche 911 and the Four Seasons! Love that woman.
What male fashion trends do you hate?	Shorts that sit above the knee. They look awful on any guy over 13. Man buns. Eww. Socks and sandals. Not really a trend but something they do sometimes.	Baseball caps with the stickers still on. Why leave the stickers on? Why?? Also, guys who tuck the tops of their ears into their caps. I never noticed this until my husband pointed it out. Now it’s the second thing I see, after those goddamn stickers.
What are your most controversial criteria when looking for a romantic partner?	Male here, I won't date or consider women who; Have kids, are fat, was fat once, have bad skin, have tattoo's (that can be seen in a cocktail dress), smoke, are uneducated, are ghetto, date outside of their race, are messy, have money issues, saggy tits, doesn't wear make-up etc Edit: chew's with their mouth open.	I won't date a woman with kids is my most "controversial" I suppose. I know that's not really so out there but a lot of people act like I'm the bad guy for not wanting that baggage/responsibility.
What do you wish women would understand more?	Doing some housework and cooking is NOT the same as throwing your back out doing hard labour all day coming home with cut up bleeding hands and swollen feet, etc The time of men working hard and women staying at home is over. Yet I still encounter women who are perfectly happy to try to make men pay for their comfort. I love cooking, I don't mind cleaning. I would love having an easy life where all I have to do is cook and clean. I just don't love doing those things for someone who has been sitting on her fat lazy ass doing arts and crafts or playing video games all day while maybe cleaning one thing. I will only respect a woman who works as much and as hard as I do. Get a job.	You need to tell a lot of us if you want us to just listen or if you want us to provide solutions.
Women who live alone, what are some of your tips/advice/life hacks/etc for other women that live alone?	I'm very much an extrovert, so I find living alone a bit challenging. Find scheduled ways to see people in the evening -- TV watching with friends, or bar trivia, or a class, or something. Otherwise, I crave going into the office just so I can have social interaction.	The last thing I wanna do when I'm sick is go out to the grocery store. Keep food on hand (soup, crackers, etc.) that you like in case you come down with a flu or cold.
How far have you seen someone’s desperation for sex or a relationship take them?	Are we including mass shootings or only stuff from people we know personally? Cause if news stories count, it’s mass shootings.	My best friend is in a relationship with a man that gives her so little thought that he *forgot to buy her a Christmas present.* They live together and had their third anniversary in September. He bought everyone else in his life thoughtful, expensive (!) presents. He just...forgot her. He told her that, the day before Christmas. She had the perfect gift under the tree for him and he came clean and told her that he hadn't remembered to buy her a gift, and suggested that she make an Amazon list. I hate him so much for making her feel so insignificant, but she loves him still.
Men who have been intimate with both men and women, what are the greatest differences?	I haven't had many partners but I'm guessing that besides physical differences like genitals, there's going to be more of a difference between people than genders. In previous threads like this I've heard that girls are better kissers, although I haven't found that to be true personally.	Skin is a big one that rarely gets mentioned. People with male sex hormones are just rougher, and their skin resists moving more. Obviously this shifts a little with body type, but not as much as you might think. The reason is estrogen. It actually causes thinning of the skin, leading to a softer feel, more pliability, and increased sensitivity. I was in a relationship with a trans woman before and through her transition, and it was hard to believe I was feeling the same person's skin after her hormone levels were corrected. This is also why women tend to be more susceptible to cold temperatures. ...I feel really creepy talking about skin this much.
Women who have been blamed (explicitly or silently) for a dead bedroom, what is your side of the story?	>I'm inclined to think that if it takes two to tango, it takes two to stop tangoing. Not saying you're wrong. But you need to think this through a little better. It really only takes one to stop tangoing: your partner don't want to tango no more, they'll walk off. Unless you're proposing putting a gun to someone's head, it really does literally take two to tango, and only one to stop.	Ours was for a period of time. Contributing factors - I had an awful pregnancy. By the second trimester we were fighting almost daily. I couldn't take medication and was depressed. The only "intimacy" we had was attempts to initiate sex with me, but when the last hours were spent arguing that's just not gonna work. Following that, I got on meds. They killed my sex drive. Newborn was more than SO could deal with, so he started just not being home. Would go out as soon as he walked in to avoid helping with baby or house stuff. Came back in wasted, again would try to initiate sex when I was on about two hours of sleep, heavy medication, and pissed off. We actually did resolve both the built up resentment and lack of sex, but it took time and work.
Hey Friends. What responsibilities are you hiding from today?	well, i'm on reddit at work but that's kind of normal... i watched two drug deals happen right outside my work window today and i did nothing. next time, however, i will not do nothing.	Work. I have a lot of shit to do but I do not want to do aaaaany of it. I'm sitting here on a YouTube journey through 90s and early 00s pop music instead.
Ladies, how would you feel about your SO clubbing and getting drunk/high with his friends, who are all single/actively on the prowl for sex?

Guys, can we talk about how messed up dating culture has become?	I just feel like all these "dating apps/sites" made the process of actually dating and getting to know someone and ruined it. The process of actually building a relationship over the course of actual dates seems to be the way of the past.	Being straightforward starts with you. Gotta be ready to get some flack back, but if it's what you want, you'll find people who want the same. This will also presumably change as you get older, at least it did for me. By the time I was in my mid 20s, everybody was desperate for people to stop spinning bullshit. By 30 people tell you what's up on the first date.
How many of you stalk ON FACEBOOK - Exes, exes new partners, Exes...exes, People you don't like? How far have you gone? For how long? WHY?	I don't even use facebook.. it's toxic, in my opinion. I try to allow people to have their space and privacy and tell me things as they choose to, not stalk around trying to be nosy. A couple times in the past I've quickly checked on people just because they had been out of my life for awhile and wanted to see how they were doing but nothing creepy. That's one of the reasons I try to make it difficult to search for me, honestly. It's fucking unnerving thinking friends, family, or a partner might try to look that deeply into my life without me knowing. It's nothing I wouldn't tell them anyway - it's just the idea of it.	I stalk everyone, all the time. Seriously. Once, I got as far as my ex's ex GFs old Livejournal that hadn't been updated since 2008. I'm a master stalker and i'm not ashamed.
Those of you who work while going to school full time, how do you do it?	Suck it up and work smart. You likely won't have a single hour of free time in your life. It's perfectly normal. Just keep working. Cut everything out of your life that isn't school or work, and maybe 5 hours a week of lifting to keep your sanity. When I graduated and got a job in my field where I was working only 40 hours a week and making plenty of money I didn't know what to do with all my free time. School will only be a few years of your life but working while in school teaches you an incredible work ethic.	I worked 20 hours a week while taking 18-20 credits in Computer Engineering. It's ALL about scheduling and time management. Schedule your classes back to back to back. Start with morning classes. Try to have your classes done by noon or 1 in the afternoon. Then you can work until 5 or 6, and do homework / labs from 7 until 11 or so. Make your lunches & dinner and bring them with you. I actually even kept my weekends pretty free this way.
Why do people keep spreading the belief that "women like douchebags"?	There are a lot of really good answers in this thread already, but there's another factor that comes in from time to time. Men with Dark Triad traits are often more successful with women. TRP and TRP-esque people mistakenly attribute this to "women liking assholes" but in reality, men with Dark Triad traits are just much better at being manipulators and actors than regular guys. Take someone like Ted Bundy or H. H. Holmes. Brutal serial murderers who had women flocking to them. Part of it was that they were good looking but a larger part is that Bundy and Holmes were very good at playing the part of a "perfect" man. Accounts of Holmes say that he was level-headed, never shouted at his wives or paramours, seemed to love children and animals, and was very doting and kind.	Other answers are pretty spot on. To add on my own views: - People see the woman the douchebag is sleeping with and think, "Women like douchebags." But no one sees the other 5 women he chases who don't give him the time of the day because they think he's a tool. - Men say that in hopes that if they really do want women, all they have to do is become a douchebag. They don't get enough sex as their current selves, so they hold up hope for sex when they do become douchebags.

Single women who wants a relationship but never found anyone, how do you cope up with loneliness?	I envy people who can be happy not being in a relationship. I’m definitely not one of those people. Luckily I found a great guy and remarried 3+ years ago at 46.	I live in the Bay Area, so I got two jobs to pay for my apartment, and now I have no free time. But I do have a cat, an extensive library, and a really nice apartment all to myself. I also bought a high end vibrator.
What do you do when your roomate brings a girl in his room?	Fuck no you arent supposed to leave. You two cohabit the same space. If he wasnt nice enough to give you a heads up, or even ask if you wouldnt mind dipping out, then fuck him. Stay right wherever it is you want to stay.	You're supposed to coordinate with your roommates about getting the room alone if one is looking to bang. At least if you share the same bedroom. If you have separate bedrooms, just leave 'em alone in his bedroom.
How different did a vagina feel than how you imagined it?	I didn't really have any built up expectations, but I was surprised by the amount of texture and how much her period blood and juices together made my skin feel warm and tingle, almost like hot sauce burning me light enough that it didn't feel like pain per se.	Very different. Above all: - The wetness. I mean, sure, I knew girls get "wet", but the first time we were making out naked, I was astonished at *how* wet she gets, just completely drenched. - The heat. I hadn't imagined it to feel so much warmer than, say, the skin on her arm or her belly. - The softness. While "silky soft" is probably one of the better analogies, it really doesn't do it justice. "Vagina" should be the top value on the international softness scale. - The little contractions. Whenever I am inside her, her vagina gives these erratic, tiny little clenches, without rhyme or rhythm to them. The first time I experienced that, it was a "whoa! it's alive!" moment.
What's your opinion on positivity culture, or the goal of "staying positive" even when things are hard? Have you ever been told to "stay positive"? Do you think it's a helpful or hurtful approach?	To me, I’m a firm believer in the law of attraction. Although some things in life do suck, keeping a positive mental attitude makes a huge difference. I used to be super negative and think it was so cliche but it really turned my life around seeing the positive things in life when something shitty happens. I think people are so stuck in their ways though and their mental attitude they have to want to be positive telling someone to stay positive to someone who is a negative Nancy isn’t going to do anything.	Two thoughts here: Staying positive: as a personal goal is great. "Stay positive": as a phrase said to someone else is NOT great. It's generally advisable not to tell someone how *you* think *they* should feel.
I just watched Magic Mike and feel very inadequate. Is this how girls feel all the time about how women are portrayed in media?	Maybe insecure women and teenage girls. I don't feel inadequate because I know everything you see in the media is air-brushed and sugar-coated and there are flaws in all of us. Also, everyone is 'real' even if they seem perfect.	I'd say yes, but differently. Like some of these other ladies have said, we get slightly used to it. I honestly have never felt adequate. I don't know what it feels like to suddenly feel inadequate, because that's how it's always been. But it's worse. Magic Mike was advertised as a fantasy, something known to be unrealistic. Models in magazines, thin beautiful actresses, are represented as more normal than the guys in magic mike. edit: I'd like to say thanks for the gold, and I have genuinely loved this discussion.
What is a hobby your girlfriend/wife has that you think is really cool?	to all of you idiots who think it's funny to post things like "my girlfriend is the hide and seek champion" or "invisibility, my girl has been good at it since i met her", just know that you're breaking [this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bu6qdq/mod_post_selfpitying_validation_comments_will/) and you've contributed to me closing in on the single-day ban record and for that i thank you. also get better jokes, you're not funny.	to all of you idiots who think it's funny to post things like "my girlfriend is the hide and seek champion" or "invisibility, my girl has been good at it since i met her", just know that you're breaking [this rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/bu6qdq/mod_post_selfpitying_validation_comments_will/) and you've contributed to me closing in on the single-day ban record and for that i thank you. also get better jokes, you're not funny.
What is the best equivalent of "buying flowers for your girlfriend" that I can do for my boyfriend?	the two girl blow job is always a favorite. you might have to ask a few of your friends before you find one willing, but he'll be grateful.	If he drinks, a nice bottle of whatever he likes to drink. seeing as 'flowers/chocolate/wine' all sound like they go together as a romantic gift, you can do something similar with liquor and some other food.
How do you keep a cool head during a date when you feel like jumping your date the moment you see them?	Honestly, if your sex drive is this different... Is see that as a red flag. Don't opt in to a dead bedroom.	On my fourth-ish date with the guy I'm seeing I was very much under the impression he wanted to go slow. Like, so slow. Like, he had barely touched me the previous dates. I would've thought he wasn't interested if he hadn't also talked to me frequently and planned every date. Well, on that date we talked about what we were looking for. Then he wouldn't keep his hands off me! So, it could be that he's just not sure where you're at and is just waiting for the ok. As for actual libido killer, eat gross food. But, then if things do go to sexy time you might still be uninterested...
Do you like it when people think you are innocent?	I suppose so. I smoked cannabis in front of a constable in Hyde Park at a cannabis smoke-in when I was seventeen and very stupid. He scolded me, told me I had no business being there, that I was obviously a nice girl from a good family and I had better go home or he would arrest my no account boyfriend for bringing me there. All of which, I am afraid, was true. I was a goody two shoes and when I ditched school, the assistant head master held the door open for me to leave the building. That was the extreme of my life of crime.	It's always amazed me what people will assume about you simply because you're smart enough to keep your mouth shut. Edit forgot a word
Guys of Reddit: Do you honestly look at females and think they are hot, even when you have a girlfriend?	I want the whiteknight mods of this sub to sotp putting these fucking ridiculous tags on every post that triggers them cause its not worded PC or whatever.	It's human nature to check people out. It's nearly impossible to stop that, relationship or not. It's disrespectful for people to blatantly check others out in front of their SO and just not care what they think. But being attracted to what you're naturally attracted to doesn't equate to "he's gonna cheat." Don't worry so much.
How does the dating world change once you move out of your 20s?	The way I see it, it became very merciless You don't have a car - fuck you You don't have your own place - die You don't have enough money - kill yourself	The gulf between the haves and the have-nots gets wider, in my experience. At 25 a guy with no experience is odd, but not unheard of. At 35... well... good luck with that.
What are you ashamed of about yourself?	I use feces as a lubricant when masturbating. And on particularly heavy days, I like to make a shit pussy. A lot of work, but the experience is exhilarating.	The way I look My complete lack of self-discipline and motivation My anger management problems My lack of people skills My self-centered, arrogant view of the world. Most of myself, truth be told.
Single women with few/no friends: Do you go out and do things alone? Where do you go?	Not a girl here, but honestly you shouldn't be worried that your going out alone, don't listen to what other people say and just have fun :)	I have a friend who has never had a boyfriend, and has few friends. She's just sortof a loner and is very shy and withdrawn but she doesn't seem to mind going out alone. She goes to movies alone, out to eat at restaurants she likes. I would go out alone and bring a book. If you're in the city it's not uncommon to see people out on their own. People notice you're alone less than you think. Also on the people making fun of you, they may not realize you find it rude. I make fun of my friend all the time for going out alone but she makes fun of me because I'll make her come with me to get snacks at the store.
How do you stop being a "Nice Guy"?	OP you say: >I've been a nice guy most of my life like always being there for a girl while she's having troubles or feeling down >I only did this because I thought something more would come out of doing so You're not a nice guy, you're not even a nice person. Every "nice guy" I've met generally has generally been the same. They're not interesting people, in particular they're lazy uninteresting people (the lazy part being perfectly relevant because they think being nice alone should get them a relationship). Think of it this way, remember the nerdy kid who got a cool toy as a kid and everyone suddenly wanted to be his friend? You're the latter type of person. **YOU. ARE. BEING. THE. JERK.**	Aah, the old nice guy trap. Well, the first thing is to be up front, not get into the habit of hoping you can win affection by being nice for a while. Being nice and treating someone with respect is something you should do anyway, not only to people you want to sleep with. On a more personal note, I used to be a bit like this when I was 16/17. The following things changed - - be more impulsive, don't overthink things. It's a cliché, but it's better to regret something you have done than an opportunity missed. - Never turn down an invitation or an opportunity. Get into the habit of saying "yes". - Get more interesting hobbies. If being "nice" is the best you can do, you're probably boring. Learn a musical instrument, take up a sport, create something.
What men's product is better than its women's counterpart?	This is a great video on the "pink tax" (women's products costing more than men's =feminists rage). Whereas sensible women like yourself just buy whatever product works best regardless of gender. https://youtu.be/8HEr8zmVEZQ	Men's flannel shirts tend to be broader through the shoulders than women's, I've found. I can actually move and reach up high in them.
What little things make your SO 10x more attractive to you?	-When we're meeting up for the first time that day, he says hello by picking me up and kissing me. -He's brings out the best in everyone. I swear, each person he talks to walks away with a smile. -He's passionate about the environment, and reduces waste as much as he can, even if it's awkward. Example, a store was giving out samples of some drink. He asked them to pour two samples into his nalgene so we wouldn't waste two sample cups. -He sits next to me, instead of across from me. -He never doubts my abilities. He never looks at something and says, "I don't think you can do that." Instead, he tells me to go for it, and if I fail, he encourages me to try again.	It's the way he looks at me. He gets this look on his face and I just know he's stupid in love with me.
What would be the "best" way to tell my husband I don't love him anymore?	Why do you need to tell him? Just file for divorce and he'll figure it out. > will share them 50/50 as he is a great dad How generous of you to let him see his kids half the time. You truly are a kind and giving person. What if he's not interested in sharing the kids with you and goes for full custody?	[/r/divorce](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/) is a much better place to ask this. Not that it's inappropriate here, you'll just get better answers over there. It's a surprisingly compassionate subreddit.
What's going on in your life that you feel like you can't talk to anyone about?	My ED is back. I feel like I'm in control of it but I know it's slowly taking over my life from the edges in. My mom is in denial about me having an ED, I don't want to put it on my best friend, and I don't want to tell my therapist because she'll make me talk about it and nag about stopping. This all started because I gained 30ish lbs after leaving an emotionally abusive relationship in August, which I'm still reeling from. Ugh.	I don't feel like I have much to live for at the moment. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I know that's how it'd come off if I told someone. I just don't think I'd care much if I found out I was dying or something.
What's something men insist is true that you just aren't buying?	This one might go counter to a lot of opinions on here. But there are a lot of men that feel that women need to be protected. I actually think that's flat out wrong. If anything, men are the one that need protection. Men have much more violence inflicted on them than women. Whether it's war or at a local bar. Oh, and of course men commit suicide more often, are less likely to go to college, etc...	'Men can't make noise during sex because years of masturbating quietly has conditioned them to be totally silent'. As if women are masturbating to screaming orgasms as teens in a house full of parents/siblings??
Do you hump where you pump?	He probably just takes his gym time super seriously. I wouldn't take it personally. Also I wonder the wisdom of getting naked with someone who refers to going to the gym as 'pumping'. You might have dodged a bullet here.	>I took this personally as he obviously thinks I'm a rancid swine. This made me laugh. I can sort of see his reasoning in that he values his gym time and wouldn't want to have awkward encounters with an ex if he broke up or perhaps become known as pursuing women at the gym, but at the same time there are a lot of different gyms out there. If I had such an opportunity when I was single I might have taken it.
She's obese now. It kills me; what can I do?	If you are disgusted by her and you want to leave, then just do it. It kind of seems like you're basing a lot of your feelings about her on her appearance which is disgusting in itself imo. However, if you're not happy and you feel that it is not going anywhere, then leave. On another note, have you tried talking to her at all about this issue? Not just skirting around it, but a complete, up-front confrontation of the subject. Maybe there's something you don't know about or she is afraid to tell you. Why don't you try working out together?	Is this perhaps about attraction, more than it is about love? I remember a Simpson episode that stuck with me, where Homer gets incredibly fat and Marge says something in the lines of: *"I love you, but I'm no longer attracted to you"* For anyone to say something constructive on this, I think you should elaborate. Just a friendly tip :)
Have you ever "broken up" with a close friend? How did you do it?	Neither of you are the same people you were when you were close growing up. It's perfectly natural for people to mature at different rates, develop different interests or acquire different sets of values. People will come and go in your life for many reasons. You don't need to "break up" (as annoying as he seems, I'm sure you wouldn't want to never talk to/see him again, nor hurt his feelings, nor burn any bridges). Just make yourself less available and let the friendship fade on its own.	If the person won't leave you alone, or is actively making you a worse person, I'd say you should "break up with them" as you put it. But if you just don't like them anymore, just stop hanging out with them and talking to them more than absolutely necessary. No need to make things dramatic if you don't have to.
How good does it feel to make a comment watching a sports game and then a second later hearing the announcer say the same exact thing?	Not that great because announcers are usually idiots. You only know this if you used to play the sport you are watching at a high level	I know basketball so that happens enough when I watch that. It feels good. It just verifies that you know what you’re talking about.
What have you discovered about your ancestry or lineage that you didn't expect?	That I don't give a fuck about it. I was always trying to figure out this shit or that shit when I was younger. Then I realized, I live in America. Bloodlines are dead. And nobody gives a flying fuck about your heritage.	My great uncle ran the Haitian secret police and tried to grab power before being put in jail and summarily excuted. Good times
How do you tinder-date safely?	If you are legit worried about being "murdered by a stranger on the Internet," online dating maybe isn't for you.	I forward the guy's contact details and photos to a friend, and let them know where I will be and what time I plan to get home. That just covers your bases if something happens and you need to be found. On the date, I make sure we meet somewhere public, and I don't disclose where I live until I'm sure he's all right. I met my bf on tinder and on our first date we were joking about how we had sent our friends each other's photos in case we got murdered!
How are you doing? Any miscellaneous things you want to talk about or need help with?	I'm doing fucking awful. Women are dangerous to your emotional well-being. They should be avoided at all costs. I'm seriously going to give up relationships if this one fails. I just can't fucking stand another break up. I'll dedicate my life to something else than love. I'll be happier for it.	I know reddit is pretty anti-religion, but I'm struggling with mine right now. Hispanic dude raised in a Christian family, but recently I haven't been praying, going to church, or anything really. Times got kinda tough recently, I lost a good job in December and Tuesday I start school for a couple of Cisco certificates so I can enter the IT field instead of driving again. Long story short, I'm 23 but I feel lost. I shouldn't since I'm still relatively young but I feel like I fucked up not going to college and shit.

How do men ask you out?	Well, the only one to ever succeed did so because we actually knew each-other and he asked me to something he knew I was personally interested in. Strangers asking me out or asking for my number will never be accepted.	Most recently, I went to a bar with a girl friend and as soon as we entered this guy immediately started chatting her up. I was standing there, bored, for at least two minutes before that guy's friend started talking to me. I actually couldn't hear him over the loud music, but I liked that when most guys would just start yelling or take the opportunity to get inappropriately close, he kept his voice level and remained respectful. His friend wanted to leave after a little while, and the guy I was talking to calmly and politely asked for my number. I was amazed at how confident he was--he acted like it wasn't a big deal at all, as if he were asking for a friend's number. I gave it to him. He texted me the next morning asking me out. We've been dating for a few months now.
How would you feel if your SO refused to buy tampons/pads for you?	I would buy my own because why couldn't I in the first place? That's not his responsibility, it's mine. And if he's uncomfortable with it, I wouldn't blame him. Periods are the worst and it's gross. But first of all, rule #1 always stay over stocked on tampons/ pads. Rookie mistake.	I never understood why guys were so weird about buying tampons. As a cashier the only thing I'm thinking is that maybe you should grab some M&M's while you're at it 😂
Do you have to be completely over an ex to start dating again?	How else am I going to forget that person unless I find someone to "cover up" all of those old negative feelings?	Really depends on what you mean by getting over her. If you've gotten past the desire to be with her and you understand that you will never date her again, then you're ready to date someone new.
What is the most obvious flirting you've been entirely oblivious to?	This thread pops up every now and then and my answer is the same. I don't miss any obvious flirting. Though I'm sure it happens frequently that I miss flirting that the girl thought was obvious. Saying she should come over to watch a movie is *not* obvious flirting, nor is it flirting at all in my book. If you want me, learn to flirt properly.	A girl was telling me she should come over to watch a particular movie. I said: "Nah, it's an action movie, you probably won't like it."
What thing you added to your morning schedule that helped you a lot?	An earlier bed time. "But," you may start, eagar to point out the flaw in my statement,"d3jake, you devilishly clever man, that's a decision made *before* your morning routine. Tis a silly mistake, and therefore out enjoy men." Here's why. I had low ambition to get out of bed earlier and get more accomplished before work. I made an effort to go to bed earlier, and found I had time and energy in the morning to make a decent breakfast, pack a good lunch, and get out the door early. It all tracked back to getting to bed earlier.	Making my bed. I won’t let myself leave my room in the morning without doing it. Then if everything goes to shit throughout the day, ill still have a nice already made bed to come lay in.
Why does/doesn't a girl calling you "daddy" bother you?	Dominance. Any guy that claims not to like it is either lying or likes pegging. Edit: please downvote more. I added one.	How often does this happen IRL? I have never encountered it but it seems to come up in conversations on reddit a whole lot. Not sure I would mind, it's pretty naughty.
How are some of you able to wear jewelry specifically earrings permanently, they are so uncomfortable it’s like never taking off your makeup kinds of uncomfortable?	I'm a jeweler, so I make all of my own jewelry. One of my goals when making a piece is to make sure that it's comfortable :) so the earrings I wear every day are super easy to sleep in, wear hats with, work with etc. and I basically kind of forget that they're in!	I wear a ring every day. I never notice it unless I take it off for something -- then I check my finger every 10 seconds and feel extremely uncomfortable. As for earrings, I've been lazy lately but I wore them every day for 10 years. I choose small ones that don't weigh much or swing around (usually studs but I do have some dangling ones) so I just forget about them. I can't remember ever even noticing them after the first few months. I think it's just habit. I almost never wear makeup so putting on mascara or gloss will make me very very aware of the fact that I have something on my skin all day, but earrings I just forget.
Ladies that transitioned from working to homemaker, what is the good, the bad, and the ugly?	I don't like the term homemaker-- I prefer female stay at home dad. This way I'm respected for opting out to focus my kids & artistic projects instead of vilified for being a regressive dullard. :)	Please remember to put money away on her personal pension during the time she's a SAHM. Sahms often get (accidentally) shafted that way, and can end up outright poor in their old age.
Coffee shop employees, what are your pet peeves that you wish customers would stop doing?	Don't hand me your coffee mug. I don't know where it's been. I don't know how often you wash your car cup holders and if it was in your purse/bag I KNOW that's never been disinfected. Sometimes if I have my cup a a barista will insist on taking it for me to make my coffee and I always bristle at that... no thank you. I'll dump it in later. I just tell them to make it in a mug for dine in and dump it in myself so I'm not wasting any disposables	Asking for their "usual" when they haven't been in that many times. The employees get to decide if you have a "usual". They'll let you know by calling out your order before you say anything, or asking if you want your usual order, etc. You don't get to just declare yourself a regular on the 3rd day in a row that you come in when you haven't even met all the employees yet.
For those of you have siblings, how often do you talk to them?	I have two older brothers, I typically hear from one of them on major holidays like Christmas or when he wants something. The other is 20 years older and I don't really talk to him, I might exchange words once every two years? Sucks because I have five nieces, one great nieces and a great nephew and I would love to know them but I don't get that opportunity :(	Talk... once or twice a week. However... we email each other every day. My sister (64) and I (61) are both retired, happily single and live alone, about 2 miles apart. Our morning emails are to connect and make sure we're both alive and not lying unconscious on the bathroom floor or whatever. Touching base with a sentence or two is a nice way to start off each day. We play Scrabble once a week (winters in my condo, summers on her back deck) so we catch up on all the details then.
What are the differences of dating in your early 20s vs. your late 20s?	Early 20's immature and disrespectful in relationships for the most part (i.e. selfishness, not taking the other person into considerations). Near the end of your 20's if people have emotionally and intellectually matured a lot of the shit you've dealt with doesn't happen anymore.	Early 20s: I'm afraid to admit I'm trying to have sex with you. Late 20s: "So you wanna have sex?"
What's the best book you've read this year?	I've read 49 books so far this year and according to my Goodreads account, I rated 5 books 5 stars: Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson, Notorious RBG by Irin Carmon, Redefining Realness by Janet Mock, Shrill by Lindy West, and Imagine Me Gone by Adam Haslett. I think Imagine Me Gone was the best fiction.	The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness. Literally take any of the other kids at the high school in Buffy, Twilight, Teen Wolf, etc. and make them the protagonist. What weird shit do they deal with or notice without the context of knowing that supernatural stuff exists.
Do you feel as though women (in general) demand and expect too much from men, while they fail to meet or fulfill your expectations?	Dating is, and always has been, incredibly gynocentric, and with the legitimisation of the "women are wonderful" (ie, "anything they do is awesome") effect, it's only gotten worse.	Being too immature for a healthy relationship is not a gendered issue. My list of women who fit that category is bigger because I'm straight. I'm sure there are just as many immature guys out there.
What's the deal with standards?	Standards are what you prefer in a partner. There's nothing at all wrong with having any type of standard. I want a woman who's actually fit and strong, not just a cardio bunny; these women are exceedingly rare, but that's the standard they'll have to stand up to.	It's a polite and roundabout way of saying that people should both be more aware of what they have to offer themselves and have realistic expectations from others. All while tiptoeing around the concepts of 'leagues' or 'scales from 1 to 10'.
When have you found out a friend wasn't actually the good guy/girl in their relationship stories after all?	Why would she tell you that? As a shut in, if I confided in someone something like that I'd be fucking devastated that they did that.	Guy I worked with constantly bitched about how insecure his wife was about their relationship. He worked late a LOT to support his wife and their two kids. She thought he was out with other women. He was later fired when he was caught in the supplies room with the office secretary.
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO, for reasons that were out of their control?	What are some examples of reasons out of their control? (Just want to make sure I am understanding the question as intended)	The first part of the relationship was great. He's hilarious, spontaneous, smart, and fun. But once we had dated for a few months I realized he didn't know how to relax. In our relationship or just in life. He didn't know how to hang out. If he came over, I had to be "on" the whole time, entertaining him. If I didn't have a plan for the day or just wanted to chill, he would suddenly remember all the things on his to-do list, start making excuses, and leave. He was great at parties, but the lack of one-on-one time made me feel really distanced from him. So my brain started reassessing and my attraction took a nose dive. I still think he's an amazing person though. We just weren't great for each other.
How to pursue a healthy platonic relationship with a woman?	You're essentially trying to fight your own biology. You could have close females friends and still see them as a potential partner. I don't personally recommend it, but it is possible.	As a guy with mainly female friends, I think it's important to recognize that you can't fight biology in the sense that if they're attractive, you will find them attractive. However, that doesn't mean you have to flirt with them or see them as a potential relationship, that bit is up to you.
What are some of the best products that you have bought that changed your life?	Crock pot liners. Yeah I know they’re terrible for the environment, but the less often I have to wash the stone ware (by hand) the better.	Acne Patches As soon as I get a zit, I put one on it and within a few hours I peel it off and the zit is gone! And the patch shows all the white gunk it pulled out
Do you ever have intrusive thoughts? What are they?	Having to use my inner demons to harness absolute murderous rage if something were to happen to my son. The thing is, when I joined the Marines after 9/11, to get revenge and kill as many of those fuckers are possible. I got my wish for that. So, every so often, I hear that little demon screaming "You know, if anything happens to the boy, I'm right here if you need me. Just say the word, and we get to hear the screams again"	I often randomly imagine how I'd react if one or both of my parents suddenly died. Like a horrific car accident or something. It typically just bums me out for a few seconds until I think "why am I thinking this"
When did you realize you were funny and how do you think having a good sense of humor has helped you in your life?	I realized I had a good sense of humor when I got to college. I make a joke out of anything good/bad. It’s how I cope. After opening up to some peers in college about life in general. While some people laugh it off, over the years I’ve been told multiple times “How are you laughing at this? You should go see someone.” I began to think if I didn’t have the humor I have today, I’d probably be depressed and suicidal. If you live to talk about it tomorrow, you can laugh at it.	I grew up homeschooled and always felt like an outsider. I tried to fit in by blending in as much as possible, but if anything it made my desperation more obvious. At home, my family communicated through quirky, dry sarcasm. Eventually, I started to let a little of that slip out. When people laughed, I suddenly felt more accepted than I had ever felt before. Just thinking about the times I've been called "funny" is more precious to me than any award or achievement. In a way, it's limited my ability to communicate in larger social situations. It's my fallback when I'm feeling insecure or fearful of judgment. But I think the trade-off has been worth it.
Have you ever had experience when a friendship turned into a romantic relationship?	My current girlfriend of a bit over a year, actually. We met through a mutual friend when she was hooked up with another on a blind date. They went out for a while but between events in their lives and personalities not meshing they didnt work out. She and I stayed friends through all of it and one day we realized we both had out of the blue attraction to each other.	Yes. I’ve never actually “dated.” I’ve just started hanging out with women and at some point, we both realized how we felt and express our feelings for each other. It feels the most organic.
What was the final moment when you knew you're in the wrong relationship? What was that 'little moment' that told you it'll never work out?	When he told me he lved me... I laughed. Not once did I ok pause. I didn't and never did live him..	He came home from work and declared that some guy “tried to rip him off”. Upon further review.. guy was supposedly one of his good friends, he had loaned him $5, and was pissed that the guy didn’t pay him back that day (on payday). Sounds super minuscule, but it was something so small and he played the biggest victim over it. Talking about how he hopes his “friend” rots in hell, how dare he try to rip him off, “no one gets away with disrespecting me like that”. It was $5 for lunch to a friend/coworker that, in the beginning of our relationship, he had claimed was one of his best friends. That’s when I knew I couldn’t put up with that kind of... whatever the fuck it was.
Guys who have accidentally knocked out your girflriend/wife, what happened?	Hell with it; I'd say this counts: I thought that it was men who generally pass out immediately after sex, and women tend to get a bit buzzed. But one of my exes would be out cold after O #4 or 5. She'd tap out and then be snoring like 3 minutes later, sometimes even mid-sentence.	One of my first girlfriends came into the bathroom while i was taking a shower and started throwing cold water over me. So i take the shower head and start to soak her with it, as she turns around to run she ran straight into the edge of the door and knocked herself out cold. She had a huge lump on her head and i was scared all her family would think i'd hit her.
Whats the next romantic or sexual taboo that Western society will give up?	Hopefully, with more people than ever before leaving organised religion, we can be a lot more open and realistic about sex (the good parts and the bad), and lose the artificial guilt and trappings based on primitive voodoo shtick. Hopefully this also means the elimination at some point of abortion clinic protests and bombings, and taxpayer funded abstinence-only sex education programs. It'll likely never happen, but it's a nice thought.	I'm thinking nudity on TV. We already have incredibly popular TV shows that have nudity, and sex as well, that have not ended the human race with their exposed nipples. Game of Thrones comes to mind
Would you rather have a trained T-Rex that you could saddle and ride everywhere or 100 million dollars?	$100 mil. I'd go bankrupt, or violate about a hundred laws, the first time I had to feed the t-Rex.	I'll take the hundred million. Properly invested, the annual return would constitute **fuck you money** for my current lifestyle. And I wouldn't have to sorry about shoveling dino shit into a truck.
What are the sexiest skills a woman can have? Like if a sexy musician dude is a panty-dropper for women, what is the equivalent turn-on for men?	Little to no makeup. When out together, I never see a smartphone. Never mentions social media. Rides mountain bikes. Loves to cook like I do. Doesn't care for high fashion.	I find female musicians incredibly sexy. I was in a band and there was this small, shy, girl who had a fairly average appearance. She had a very low confidence attitude about herself. Hunched shoulders. Quiet speech. The moment she picked up that violin she transformed. The energy and posture needed to play that instrument instantly conveyed a confidence I didn't know she was even capable of. Definitely made her sexy. I also tend to like artists. If she can paint or draw that's a big turn on for me.
What do you think would happen to the dating landscape if the average guy put as much effort into his appearance as the average girl?	Idk man ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, I think the 1-2 hours I spend 5 times a week squatting, deadlifting, pressing and rowing along with a caloric deficit is a lot more effort than shaving legs and putting on makeup. The rest are the same. Maybe women take more time to do their hair but we also have to deal with our facial hair. Edit: Many women are quite pathetic going all downvote and validate me because it’s so hard to put on make up, follow some regime and not eating like a pig. Please if a 2M tall man can workout, go to work and eat <2k kCals/day you too can eat < 2k kCals. Much hard work, very strong womyn. Please...	I think the average guy would, if he knew what would work and was confident it wouldn't make him look stupid. When I was single I knew I had a very boring way of dressing and no particular sense of style. Every time I'd see a guy who dressed flashier or whatever I'd think to myself "yeah but if I do that I'll look like I'm pretending," or "does he look good or does everyone just think he's a douchebag?". I did, however, put tremendous effort into what I *thought* women wanted. Some of it was a waste, some of it wasn't wrong. Mostly fitness and getting good enough at stuff to hopefully be attractive if anyone saw me doing it.
Girls who got straight A's in school, college, etc., where are you now?	I'll answer for my sister, young twenties: Recently became a single mom with a 1 year old child, just got a Master's, dropped out of PhD program and can't afford to keep the house without financial assistance from the family.	My family was really toxic and I had a miserable, lonely childhood. Due to their high standards and threats if I didn't meet them, was a very high achieving student in high school but tanked in college. After college I did low-level clerical work and hated it. Then I met my husband, he believed in me and agreed that I could do more with my life with just one support person. So he paid for me to go to nursing school, where once again I was a straight-A student. I won an academic contest in my last that gave me a $3000 scholarship and a job interview at a local hospital. I got hired, and have happily been a nurse there ever since!
In my mid 20s, what books do you recommend for me to read?	Atlas Shrugged, The Road to Serfdom, the art of war, Economics in one lesson, The Law (Bastiat). After that we can go into heavier reading.	I say this every time and I will say it again. East of Eden by John Steinbeck. There are some great recommendations in this thread that I have read, but none of them come even close to the sheer godliness that is East of Eden.
What seemingly inconsequential thing did someone say or do to you that really messed you up in some way?	when i was about six years old a girl in my gymnastics class told me i was the ugliest girl in the class. i didnt realize it until years later, but that was the start of my insecurities. also, a few years ago my best friend made a comment about how i run, and now i try to avoid running in front of people because of it.	Mine is sort of a recurring one, but my older sister is legally blind, and every time I try to talk to my mom about any kind of problem in my life, she says "Just think how much harder life is for your sister!" It's made me feel guilty about feeling upset about my problems, and it's also really made me resent my sister, which isn't fair to her because she would never say anything like that. My mom always says that she's just trying to give me some perspective and that it shouldn't bother me so much, but it feels like nothing going on in my life is significant enough to matter to her.
Ladies, how many of you struggle to "get off" also, any tips???	Wear a pair of fitted panties, preferably cotton. Then rub your clit through them after drinking a glass of water. You'll feel the sensitive area where your clit is. Then rub it in up and down or whatever direction you want. Do it a bit fast but don't put a lot of pressure, just use medium pressure. See if it works for you. It did for me	It is fairly rare that I orgasm during partnered sex. It was years before I could cum at all, honestly, years in which I found masturbation boring. I was sexually active, I enjoyed sex, but orgasm wasn't something I'd experienced. Somewhere in my mid 30, that changed for whatever reason. I don't know if it was a shift in hormones or a growing comfort with sexual fantasy or something else, but orgasm became possible, if still not easy.
What's one aspect of being adult you found weird/never anticipated?	This may be small, but birthdays. As an adult, birthdays do not entitle you to special treatment simply because of the date. You're not 11 anymore. Act like it. People who think that they deserve special treatment at work because it's their birthday make my eyes roll. Seriously. You're 27. Or 35. Or 40. Get up and get to work on time. No, you don't get to shirk duties or get everything you want because it's your birthday. You're an adult. Act like it. It's just another day. It's different if your friends and co-workers want to do something for you. But when you demand special treatment or get pissy because you didn't get something special, that makes you look like a child in my eyes. Grow the fuck up.	I thought that I would naturally get better-looking when I got older, because everyone kept telling me I would "grow out of" things like acne and awkwardness. I waited for a while and eventually I just looked a bunch of stuff up on the internet and tried it to see if it helped. It did. It turns out you have to actively participate in making your appearance adultlike. Hmm.
Young guys: what is a common statement/belief here that makes you think "yeah, you're definitely not part of my age demographic"?	Prejudice. Alot of older people where I live will judge the fuck out of you if you are anything but white. The problem is especially awful with Muslims.	The fact that we have posters who have never not had the internet at their beck and call. I'm from the generation who got it young, but I do remember a time before broadband.
What is your opinion on Obama cutting the funding for abstinence only sex education programs?	On the one hand I think if a school is a private religious school it's their business what they teach students (but then I suppose their funding would come from a private source anyway) (I don't know much about it, sorry). On the other hand, I think it's important to know how to keep yourself safe from diseases and what to do in the event that you become pregnant. I hate to see people constantly making bad decisions that ruin their lives later, and I think early education might be a good deterrent. I also think self-esteem plays into sexual health, but that's a hard thing to teach.	Good. The government shouldn't waste money on programs that don't work and spread misinformation. Refusing to teach kids about safe sex only makes them ill equipped to deal with it. Kids are going to have sex anyway, regardless of whatever "promises" they make to adults. Hell, even Bristol Palin, who *gets paid* to preach abstinence, was able to get knocked up 2 different times out of marriage, so you can see what a joke abstinence only education is.
What are your thoughts on a former fat girl?	> Would it change your opinion of her if you knew she used to be over weight? Yes > What are your general thoughts that run through your head when a girl tells you she used to be fat? How fat are we talking... Geez I better not invite her to dinner > Are you more or less attracted to her? That depends entirely on whether I was attracted to her before she told me she used to be a ham. > Or are you just indifferent about it? No madam. > I just lost a bunch of weight Good job.	Good for her, I was a fatty in high school. Probably the only difference is that I'd respect her work ethic a little more off the bat because I know what it takes. Other than that... nope, no difference. Edit - creeped on your progress pics, well done!
What's something that you put many hours into, that you now regret?	Certain video games when I was a teenager. Some of them made me really mad and then I'd feel real bad about myself (because something made for entertainment shouldn't upset me so much). I should have just stopped playing them but I kept going back to anger. They were my escape and I guess the frustration from them was more grounded than the frustration from just being 16.	Reddit. It sucks up a lot of my time during downtimes at work. It's sometimes entertaining at the moment, but 99% of what I read is never thought of again and is forgotten by the next day or two. It's weird
What are the most common casual forms of sexism you experience?	I wish I had a better answer to this. To be completely honest, the only time I ever truly experienced sexism was when I worked somewhere as the *only* female employee and my authority in my job was often dismissed by customers and the owner. I quit the job and don't associate myself with the owner anymore; any time I experience sexism, I separate myself from it. The Kind of sexism that bothers me most is the kind that people resign themselves to being complacent with and then blaming other people for. Stand up for yourself. At least for me, avoiding experiencing sexism is as simple as separating myself from it when I see it happening.	The posts about people assuming that whoever is in charge must be a man reminded me - 3 times I've had women bosses, their first names were Gillian, Erica and Carol. There was a steady steam of mail / phone and face to face queries for Julian, Eric and Carl.
What has been your biggest "life isn't fair" moment thus far?	When we first met it was magic. She would call me three four times a day..........I fell for her. Within a three months she broke up with me to go to her birthday dinner with a fat ugly guy who had lots of money............I only found out about this later. She then pursued me again and after three more months of no obligation sex........dumped me again..............in the following conversations..........yes she still called me...............She admitted she was incapable of love and didn't like to be held. Fuck me.	Finding out we lost our first baby, then coming home my grandfather had a massive stroke and wouldn't survive the week. Life sucked that day.
Any story you guys have when after having sex with someone, you had this "I cant believe I just had sex with that person" moments ?	My current gf...... She is so fucking hot, she pursued me, and everytime we're done I look at her in disbelief that I was just with her.... I'm the luckiest person ever....	My bartender. She's absolutely gorgeous. I've had a huge crush on her for a very long time. One drunken night she approached me and just straight up asked why we haven't fucked. So we did. And it blew my goddamn mind.
What non-sexual / non-relationship themed question is on your mind right now?	What's a good method of souicide that leaves no mess and minimizes trauma for people that love you, and the person that finds you?	Why did shows like "This Old House" and "The Joy of Painting" disappear and why is television flooded with reality shows?
How many push-ups can you do in one set?	It's funny to see people with ranges of 40-80. I'll bet an asscheek they're glorified dips that you just happen to do at a slightly more horizontal position than usual. Here's a suggestion: do a bunch, write down the number. Take some rest, watch how to do proper [push-ups](https://youtu.be/aSkD88NciQY) then post the new number. :D Edit: [Another tutorial to crush your ego](https://youtu.be/WpobgeNpOCI?t=10s)	On my own free will about 40. If I had an grizzly old boxing coach screaming in my face, and a hot girl watching, maybe about 60.
What "grass looks greener over there" decision did you end up regretting?	Reconnected with a guy whom was not even in my friend group in high school, on fb. After some time, ended up hooking up and my SO of 5 years asked me point blank if i was cheating on him a few days afterwards. I told him the truth and we ended up breaking up. He was emotionally unstable and took his own life less than a week later. Since then my life has been a downward spiral. I will never forgive myself or be able to get past what I have done. The grass is definitely not greener. I’d give anything to get back what I had. But I know I don’t deserve him. I’m toxic and tortured with guilt and shame. Everything has changed.	Leaving a job, city, home, hobbies, life that I was happy with for a "better" role. It just didn't go over well. I was making more money, but I had been significantly happier before.
What creates an incel or a nice guy?	I think you've ventured too far away from /r/IamVerySmart Fucking Good Friday getting kids off of school so they have time to shitpost	Poor socialization would be the lion's share, I'd say, at least for incels. People who grow up ostracized by their peers never have the opportunity to properly develop their social skills, and taking the effort to rectify this can be logistically difficult in addition to the difficulties of trying to learn how to be properly social and play catch-up. Some people do seem to just be born pricks or become them from an early age without anyone having alienated them. As for Nice Guys, at least some of that is because of our own media when it comes to romance.
[NSFW] What are the best and worst one-night stands you've ever been had?	Met a girl at an Abercrombie party for employees. My cousin was the manager. 5mins after meeting and complementing her thing, we went in the bathroom and preceeded to get it on! Quickest one night stand ever. I hate that moment because 99.9% if the time it's not that easy. I also think it depends on where you are looking. I live in LA. The social game rules here are far different than anywhere else.	Best: PCB Spring Break 2007. I was a sophomore, I went with my frat, we were packed in like 10 guys per condo. Met a girl who had a family beach house there, and was staying with her friends. We fucked all the time, did a lot of drugs and had a fucking blast. MTV was there and blew the fucking roof of the place with some sick concerts/big acts. Worst: We both got nearly simultaneous diarrhea from eating some tainted icepops from some ice cream vendor cart. She only one bathroom so I used the toilet while she used the shower. This went on for what seemed like an hour until I could shower the filth off, roll home and spend the next few days mainlining gatorade and saltines.
Has anyone of you ever woken up because you had a very intense orgasm in your dream?	This is also why I feel female sexuality is more mental than anything. Physical can only get you so far.	Yep. The stimulation and orgasm I experience in my dreams (usually prompted by a full bladder) are out of this world intense. Wish I could replicate it in waking life! They happen at least once a month, usually when it's been awhile since masturbating. It's been happening since I was quite young.
What was it like being smaller than the other guys in high school?	I hit my growth spurt height-wise in 7th and 8th grade. I was still *really* skinny, though. I "filled out" in 10th grade, I think. I went from like 140 lbs to 185 lbs and not in a bad way. I could also grow a beard by 10th grade. Have a full one now, but I shave it off every once in a while.	There is a lot of violence. You start to turn toward rapid escalation and whatever you can leverage. Suddenly you are that crazy guy instead of that little guy. If I hadn't grown a foot taller in HS I would have turned into American Vladimir Putin.
How do you feel about the Mens Right Activist Movement?	There are a few things that men are legitimately discriminated against. But if you ranked discrimination, men are very much at the bottom of the list. As a white guy, I never think about my race or my gender. Which is totally a white guy thing. So mostly I feel that the MRA movement is a bit ridiculous.	Two "men's rights" issues that come to mind: one is conditions in male prisons. I knew a jailhouse nurse once. Horrendous stories. Also, I see prison rape (for men) jokes are still fair game on late night TV. Probably a sign that the lives of men in prison might not be taken seriously. Second is the ease with which we send men to war. We talk a good game about giving a fuck, but I think economics is as much a reason that the last war dwindled down. (And then there's the fact that killing men on the other side is (sometimes) regarded as a good thing, but that's war, etc. It's complicated.) So, I think there are legitimate issues. I have no idea to what extent the MRAM concerns themselves with that stuff.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever talked about in a job interview? Did you get the job?	I come across as 'posh' and people tend to be very surprised at my (not particularly pc) sense of humour. I was interviewing for a job in a factory, and after many times I was asked whether I would be able to work in a 'male dominated atmosphere', I thought I would show the interviewer by telling a joke, as the many assurances were not cutting it. I ended up telling a dead baby joke to the interviewer. I got the job.	I thought my interviewer and I had built up a solid rapport so then I jokingly told him that he looked like Toby Flenderson from *The Office*. It immediately got awkward and he seemed kind of offended by it. I spent five minutes trying to backtrack and explain how looking like Toby was actually a positive thing and how he was very underrated as a character, then he told me to stop, and we moved on. I still got the job though.

I am a man in my late 20's who has no major hobbies or interests, how can I get out of this rut?	Just do like a lot of guys in this sub and become a beta white-knight. You could spend the rest of your life prostrating yourself to women in order to make up for the oppression of the patriarchy.	What I've been doing is taking up the hobby of taking up hobbies. It can cost a lot in time, effort and money but trying things out is the only way to find a really good hobby. Build a model, make Memes, play table top games, go to cooking classes, paint a picture, make YouTube videos. Just start doing things and you'll find something you like. Not everything has to send well. You don't have to find a life long passion on your first try. You just have to keep going till something clicks.
What's one thing that irritates you about men on Reddit?	The ones who gave up on life and complain on Reddit so they can have a pity party. Go get some therapy, make up a reason to live, and go do it. Don't sit on Reddit and bitch about how shitty your life is.	How people will watch a 10-second gif of security or dashcam footage, and determine that the person in the clip 'deserved to die.'
FAQFriday: What "shallow" traits do you look for in a partner?	i wont date a girl if she isnt turning heads in public. some guys hate that, some love it. I had one redhead i dated with a ridiculous ass and going out to the mall or the movies or wherever and watching the dudes stare at her and then glare at me.....i fucking loved it. im competitive so i feel like i won, and i feel like a celebrity because ill have couples and sweet older people looking at us as well. go out with a hot girl and see how the world changes. its a different game level setting. so yeah, its not even necessarily she needs nice boobs or ass or what have you, but she needs to turn heads. if she doesnt we arent dating, at least not while im still in my 20s.	No fat women and no super skinny women. Physical attraction is very important to me and I don’t find either of those 2 extremes attractive.
What is a favorite flirtation or seduction scene from movie, tv or literature?	Love Actually, where he comes to the door and says to pretend he's carollers, and gives his secret message by placards awww	“Hey Goose you big stud—“ “That’s me, honey.” “Take me to bed or lose me forever!” “Show me the way home, honey.” - *Top Gun,* 1986

Has anyone encountered more misogyny from women?	Not personally, no. It greatly depends on perceptions and worldviews and family beliefs and stuff, though, I'm sure, as a few people have called my family dynamic 'sexist,' from Mom, Dad, and siblings alike	I feel as though it's common for people to feel the need to keep members of their own gender "in check." As such I've noticed that a lot of women say sexist shit to other women, and a lot of men say sexist shit to other men. I'm not a fan of it and I try not to feed into it though.
Asian men of Reddit, how difficult is the dating scene?	Mixed here (Chinese/White). Would not consider myself near a 10/10, but never had an issue dating other than my personality. Confidence is king and judging by this post, that might be a bigger issue than appearance. I live in Orange County so there's a ton of asians. Lots of mixed couples. I'm sure there's some prejudice towards dating Asian men, but I don't think its all that debilitating.	30 year old Korean guy in the East coast. Unless you're very attractive, or unless you're very engrossed in the Korean community, it's VERY difficult. I see many half-Asians responding, and I think you actually benefit *more* in this respect. Foreign-enough to be exotic, but familiar-enough to be common.
Ladies who sometimes take their emotions out on others, can you share skills that you've learned to help control this behavior?	When you're sad, angry, cranky, or overwhelmed, just remember this: There is someone who's always there for you, whenever and wherever you need him, he'll always be there. So if you ever have one of these moments where you wanna break down and yell for 20 minutes at the person next to you, just remember of the... [Old Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SNni4CqtMI)	I found that verbalizing how I'm feeling helps. For example, if I come home from work cranky, I'll tell my boyfriend I'm feeling stressed about work and I just need a few minutes to wind down before we do anything. Once I've said it out loud I feel like I'm more aware of my actions after that and can recognize when I'm taking it out on someone else and immediately shut it down
Professionals of reddit, how do you negotiate a salary?	I love your idea here that only salary jobs are "professional". I don't work for free, so I ask to be paid hourly and negotiate the rate from there.	I have always said "Well I was hoping/expecting an offer of $X" (with X being somewhat above my true desires but not insanely more than the initial offer). Usually HR will get back to you within a day with a counter-offer somewhere in between. If it's high enough, take it, if not, offer another value in between the current and your last expectations. When it comes to benefits/bonuses it largely depends on the company if they even negotiate those. Most rigid corporate structures, and especially large nonprofits tend to have a set benefits plan including PTO and it's usually non-negotiable. If any part of the offer is non-negotiable, HR will usually tell you up front if you bring it up.
What are some stupid things your SO does that you find funny?	They stand at attention when they are brushing their teeth. It’s completely unconscious and not related to their military service. Or so I assume.	As soon as he walks into a room with a window, he stands in front of it, with his hands on his hips and just looks out and continues the conversation we're having. He does it completely subconscious and when I just sit there and smile or laugh it him, he gets really embarrassed and flustered.
Former ugly men of Reddit, how did you clean up?	If you can "clean up" you were never ugly in the first place. What a stupid question from a guy that supposedly listens to Bach.	Honestly not sure if I am or ever was ugly, but I started shaving, take more showers, and change my pillow cases more often to keep my face clean. Also started getting haircuts more often to keep my hair looking nicer. Even though I'm not overweight, very little of my weight is muscle so I cut back on calories, once I lose enough I'll stop cutting and try to put more muscle on. Seems to be working well, I think I look better so far.
What's you're top 5 non-negotiables and why?	1. Feminist 2. Must love cats 3. Must be passionate about something 4. Must have an open mind 5. Must not be extremely religious edit: awwwww does someone not like my number one? ;)	I have found over the years that many of the things I thought of as non negotiable end up being negotiable with the right person (e.g. allergic to cats, has depression, uses tobacco products). That said, I do think there are traits that I require in a partner. They are: -Must be dedicated to being a kind and compassionate person above all. Must be central to their world view. -Must have the capacity for joy and silliness and being goofy. -Must be very physically affectionate and love cuddling and have a strong and exploratory sex drive. -Ongoing intellectual curiosity, thought, complex inner dialogue that translates to fascinating conversations together. -Must be absolutely committed to being PARTNERS; to listening to my needs and preferences too and being willing to incorporate them equally and fairly into our life circumstances and future plans.
How in shape are you guys?	I'm obese. I run 3 times a week and try to lift weights for strength, but my hormones are almost non existent so it's hard to lose weight and/or gain muscle. I can't afford the prescription steroids, so lift/run/be fat I shall be	I run around my farm a lot. I don't actually do any real exercise. I know I can outrun a goat.

Is anyone exhausted by the constant maintenance and grooming 'required' to look and feel good?	First of all, multivitamins don't really do shit. Your body can only process so much, and the rest is just clogging up your liver. As for the beauty routine, I feel like that's something that should make you feel pampered, not feel like a chore! I don't wear makeup and I wax a handful of times a year, and I definitely do not feel not put together. The best thing you can do for feeling fresh and awesome is give your body some daily exercise. There's absolutely no need for all this other crap on top of it to be beautiful.	I go through periods of feeling disillusioned with it all. Then I get lazy and stop doing some things. A week later I realise that my legs are itchy from being unshaven dry from not being moisturized, and I don't want to touch my hair because it's been over a week since I washed it. Then I regret my laziness and start up again. It's a never ending cycle. Most of my routine is for ongoing comfort, so I try to keep that in mind.
Women aged 40 and/or above, what words of wisdom can you give women in their 20s?	Don't sleep around. In fact, if you're still a virgin, remain one until you're married or very, very sure. I wish I'd remained a virgin until I was 30.	Always be sure to be self sufficient, i.e., don't ever depend on anyone else to support you. Always have enough in the bank that, should it happen that you need to, you can restart your life. Also, treat yourself to some chocolate. That's important.
What's the most uncomfortable confession of interest/a crush that you've been part of, whether receiving or giving?	When we were in high school, we were pulling an all nighter(to study Maths) with a group of girlfriends at a her house, which is on 7th floor! We heard a knock on window! Being so curious and dumb, we opened the curtains and saw a boy from our school, telling me he loved me! He even had roses! It turns out, he called firefighters, begged them to drive all the way there and let him use the ladder to help him tell me he loved me... And they actually went with it! My friends and I had a good laugh after the initial shock and fear went away... But boy oh boy, it was weird!	I was in class in high school finally asking my long time crush out. It took me two semesters to build up the courage to ask him, and the girl sitting next to me kept interrupting me, and asking me the same questions I was asking him. Since it wasn't going exactly as I had planned it in my head, I just stopped talking mid sentence, and turned around in my chair. Luckily he caught on to what I was doing, and made me finish my questioning, once the chatty girl was distracted by something else.
Guys who watch camgirls, what is the point?	There a cam girl that looks just like an ex. I mean everything, except that the cam girls hair is lighter than my ex.	I have a close friend who gets paid to do cam shows. From what I've seen, about everyone who has offered to pay for a show is someone that's obviously too shy or awkward irl to get any female interaction. It seems like they fill that void by paying a chick online to treat them nicely and be attracted to them. One of the viewers even started calling the shows "dates", so you can imagine the much bigger problems these dudes have.
Which monthly subscription services do you use and are they worth it?	I just subscribed to two pet boxes...can't say yet if they're worth it though based on the reviews, one is okay and the other is really good. I bought both on groupon though lol (save20 ! for extra 20% off locals lol!) so a $25 box is actually only costing me $8.99 right now. I've used them in the past and while a good value, I usually cancel after. I only like to subscribe to them when I can get the boxes at an extra low rate lol. I recognize that the items are already cheaper because they're bundled into a "mystery" box, but still lol.	I subscribe both to ipsy & birchbox, is it worth it? It can be hit or miss but I do feel for only 10$ each I get my $$ worth, ipsy is more makeup geared where as birchbox has more of a selection of skin care and hair care. What I've been trying to do with the excess bags/products I don't like is throw some tampons/panty liners in the ipsy bags with some makeup products I've received (and haven't used) and bring them to my local shelter for women.
Have you ever been to a party where it became apparent that you were only invited as a sex prospect?	Nah, I'm fun so people invite me because I'm fun.. AND a lady. But I've never felt like I was invited solely for my gender, I get along with everyone and talk people up, there's always been a few mutual friends at any party I go to.	Senior year of high school my friends and I were invited to a party by one of the guys we knew from our local mall. We showed up and it was immediately obvious that the only females in attendance were the two that came with us. It didn't help matters that they were watching anime porn on the living room tv. We left pretty quick.
Getting rejected romantically sucks. But how do you handle situations where they really want to remain friends?	The Friend Zone is a man she doesn't respect enough for sex but whom she wants to use to move her furniture and buy her occasional meals while she's banging some other "hotter" man. Unless you enjoy being used, abused, and treated like a wimp, you handle the situation by letting her know that a woman who isn't sharing sex is not welcome in your life. Use some version of "put out or get out."	Tell them what you told us, that being friends holds you back in the healing process. That is something almost everyone will understand and accept.
Women in long term age gap relationships (10+ years difference), when did you really feel the difference between the two of you?	Not a relationship, but a close friendship. I was 12 when we met, he was 25. I never got creep vibes from him despite what you may think and in hindsight I'm still convinced he was okay. I just started noticing that we no longer shared interests. We used to bond over common interest in games and youtube, but that kind of faded. He'd always talk about shows and films he liked that I had never heard of because I didn't grow up in his time. We just drifted apart because it didn't work.	I'm 10 years older than my husband (I'm 51), and we've been together 18 yrs. Honestly, I felt it for the first few months, but once we were married I stopped noticing. He looks a bit older and I look a bit younger so it's not really that obvious, and we have grown together in so many ways. He's my soulmate. I have given him instructions for my funeral, (sounds terrible I know) and he's always cracking jokes about my age and how he will finally get peace an quiet when I die lol 🙄
How do you start from scratch making friends when over 30?	You can try meetup, but i wouldnt recommend it. The people there are.. weird..in a bad way. I don't know how to explain it but theyre all over 35 and look like virgins. You might get lucky and find someone else who also decided to check it out their first time, but i doubt it since they post pics and that keeps normal people away. Id say go join a sports league, made some good bros back in the day when i played.	Dude start playing basketball at the same time at the gym everyday. Even if you suck. Just start a routine anywhere and independent of her. Bros will come bro. Bros always find bros.
What is your favorite dress?	I don't have it because I'm broke right now, but the second I saw [this](https://www.lulus.com/products/fame-to-claim-navy-blue-maxi-dress/301002.html) dress I fell in love. I have no clue where I'd wear it or if it'd look good on me, but holy shit is it amazing.	Old Navy has a series of dresses they used to call 'Fit and Flare' but now I think they're listed as 'Cami Dress'. They fit my body type SO WELL and they're SUPER comfy. I have four of them in different prints.
What happened that you decided to change your life?	Kept myself running in the same circle Alchohol/Drugs Drama & just certain people. I lost myself at a certain point & I really had 2 serve myself a cold dish realize my future, my goals, cutting ppl frm my life it was way too much & my potential and mty worth are way more than I was subjecting myself to	Realised I was watching anime on a Friday night by myself at University whist people where out having adventures and friendships like the ones I idolised in the very shows I watched.
What's the worst relationship advice you've ever received?	For me, personally, it's that you can't know someone without living with them before you get married. I don't agree at all, and I think that not doing so was a very good choice, and that living together is often just a kick of the can. Not always, but I've seen it happen that way	Anything that I would consider a "game", such as "don't ever be the first one to text him, wait for him to contact you", "don't send him a text after the first date saying you had fun", etc. I've found that stuff only works in the very short-term. If a guy is genuinely interested sending him too many texts won't scare him away.
What can a male do to maximize their attractiveness?	Have 500k in savings. Drive a nice car (2012 or newer). Be built like zac efron. If you don't "get it" you'll never make it with women these days unfortunately.	Well I used to look like a potato hit with the blight, but I changed my diet because I had acne, it went away then, changed my hair style and started wearing fashionable clothes, I was always an outgoing/social bloke but now I've just improved on it
I just had two cupcakes while trying to maintain a strict and clean diet, they were stale and tasted like shit. Ladies, what have you done recently as an instant gratification which immediately backfired and you now hate yourself for it?	Once I had a midnight craving and decided to eat a large apple to satiate my hunger. Midway through the apple I was full and wanted to sleep. I drowsily force fed myself the rest of the apple. So much regret.	Every single day: picking at my face because that will totally make the zits go away right? But I love the feeling of getting little tendrils of sebum out of my pores :(
What would you do if your 14 year old (male) cousin left a bottle of piss in your house after visiting?	Send him a message:"What the fuck? Why did you piss in a bottle and then leave it here?" You can try to embarrass him all you want, but maybe he was just trying to be considerate by not going to the bathroom while everyone else is already asleep and simply forgot to do something about the bottle. Or maybe he didn't have the opportunity to dispose of it (guaranteed to be 'caught' with it). I think it's best if you'd actually ask *him* why he did what he did. One of the subreddit post guidelines is: > Do not make posts trying to figure out a specific person's actions, behavior, or thinking.	Tell your parents and let them decide what to do. I'm assuming its their house, so this is their problem. If this kid is your cousin, then one of them is probably brother or sister to the kid's mom, right? They need to discuss this with the kid's mother.
What observation have you made that isn't socially acceptable to talk about?	Just dropping in a quick mod note that as usual, this thread IS subject to the subreddit rules against racism, homophobia, transphobia, and hateful/disrespectful commentary. Comments in violation will be removed. Further, invalidating or derailing comments (i.e. telling people their experiences are wrong) will also be removed.

How do you cope with being legitimately unattractive?	There's a flip side to that coin. How do people cope when they are legitimately attractive. Many become insecure because they feel they are successful because of looks rather than on competence. Many become obsessed about losing their looks as they age. Many won't get the job they want simply because they are too attractive. Many lose their looks as they age and will have no compensating qualities to fall back on. Many are in many relationships but none of them are meaningful - quantity does not mean quality. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - despite being attractive - you're not attractive to everyone. Many are treated differently because of their looks which is not always a good thing. Beauty fades but dumb is forever. Being attractive is not all it's cracked up to be.	I just... "deal with it". Life is too short to stress about things I can't change. I realized I wasn't conventionally attractive in middle school and immediately worked hard on my personality. It has done me wonders! I put a lot more pride in my intelligence and accomplishments than by how much attention I get.
Something I never understood, how long do couples normally wait before being exclusive/labeling the relationship?	I usually wait several months, but given my druthers I'd be a relationship anarchist and never bother defining things at all. My girlfriend and I still aren't exclusive, but we're clearly in a committed relationship. It took me two years to put it on facebook though.	Best of luck OP, all I can say... My wife STILL gives me shit about how back when we were dating, we'd been dating for like two months and finally she was like "So are we boyfriend and girlfriend or what?" I wasn't super experienced at dating, but even then asking her "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" felt really dumb and corny. I just assumed once a person was outside of high school that people just assumed these titles one they'd been together a certain amount of time. That'll be like 12 years ago this June. Still hearing about it.
What's the best orgasm you have ever had?	My ex bf was just amazing at going down on me. he just had a knack for doing it or something. I could chain together orgasms from it and they would hit me in succession it was totally unreal and I just melted into the floor. later he came out as gay (or bi?) and hes dating a guy now for a few years.... SUCH A WASTE OF TALENT. One of gods great jokes I think	My SO recently. We had a lot of foreplay and I don't remember exactly what we did differently this time, but oh my goodness.... I came like 5 times in a row and we had to stop before he finished because I started hyperventilating because I think I forgot to breathe. It was amazing. And hilarious having him coach me through breathing.
Guys with SO addicted to their phone, how do you handle it?	So I'm reading your replies, and it sounds like you guys are hanging around the house, and she is on the phone, and it bothers you. Get over it. It would be one thing if she can't go through dinner without pulling it out, but relaxing at home? She is not required to pay attention to you 24/7. Watching TV is not a social activity, despite what you may think. Leave her be.	We didn't get our first smartphones until after we had been married for a while, and we both went a little overboard at first until I took a step back and realized that not only was she be unreasonable, but so was I. So I just told her, "Hey, Cat, I know I've been neglecting you in favor of this piece of shit, but I've been feeling neglected too. Can we talk about this and work it out?"
When you have a new girl over, how much do you ask or not ask when making moves?	Dont ask. It makes you look insecure. Try something small like your hand on her leg. If it seems to make her uncomfortable back off if she seems into it progress	Everyone gave pretty solid advice. I'm internally dying at the thought of asking a girl "Can i cup your breast?" when you're cuddling.
What's something you shouldn't really feel guilty about, but you do?	Not feeling guilty about a bunch of shit that seems to really gut a lot of you gents out there. Sometimes I read a set of neurotic, self-absorbed posts about crushing shame this and anxiety that, and I wonder if I'm the crazy one for not having anything to add there.	I carry a little guilt that I didn't try to mend bridges with my old man before he died. I was there at the end at least, but it wasn't a time of reconciliation. I prob should have been more willing to forgive. But I didn't. And you can't go back in time. So fuck it. It doesn't bother me any more. Mostly.
Mothers of Reddit, what is one time your mothers intuition saved your child's life? What is the story?	not a mother, but it makes me absolutely sick how many people in this thread have had doctors/nurses ignore them or tell them they're overreacting, and how many people were probably not lucky enough to manage to save their kids from this. this stigma that women are hysterical and crazy needs to stop especially since it's quite obvious a mother knows when something is wrong when her child.	My mother saved me when I was a baby. As she tells it, she was having a bad dream about a clogged pipe and could hear me crying. In reality, I had gotten down from the bed in the dark early morning and started playing with the electric blanket dial. This was 1987, so it was just a piece of round plastic held on by a screw with a metal washer. Well little me thought it would be super fun to put the washer into my mouth, and it got stuck blocking my airway. I was not crying, just wobbling around on the carpeted floor making no noise. My dad says it can't have been more than 10 seconds from when I swallowed the washer to when mom woke up and grabbed me. Not sure if that counts as intuition, but I'm very glad she had that nightmare.
For women who went off hormonal birth control, what was your experience like?	I tried going off it for close to a year after being on various pills for 4 years to see if I could get my sex drive back with my ex. It didn't work: turns out I just wasn't attracted to him anymore because he was a man child. I don't remember any emotional/weight/skin etc differences at all, honestly, but maybe I've just found the holy grail of BCP for myself?	I've been on hormonal birth control for about ten years (the pill for many years, Mirena for a few others and NuvaRing for a couple of months). I always had quite a low libido and sex would hurt often. I would actually get tears down there, so I wasn't fond of the act. Now I'm off birth control for more than two years. We use condoms and I couldn't be happier! I haven't had any tears anymore, at all, and my libido is way way up. And it seems I have my emotions in check more, but I'm not a 100% sure. I can still be quite emotional, but at least now I know it's because it's who I am, and not because of the pills I take. Eta: periods are way worse and skin is a bit worse too. Worth it though.
Men of color on Askmen that have lived in different states and regions of the USA before, how much of an impact has location had on your dating life and how women perceive you?	Irregardless of color this is a true theory. It's playing into the demographics of your area. A prime example me! I'm a cityboy through and through and now live in Upstate NY, I'm either perceived as a full of himself cityboy because I like to dress nice with good fitting clothing (rare here), I'm perceived really good looking and come off intimidating to those who have an interest in me because I don't fit the status quo of the area, or I'm just completely viewed as completely neutral and odd for not dressing country like.	I'm part white, Chinese, native South American, and black, but most people consider me Chinese /filipino. I grew up in the Midwest. I could pretty much only date the few girls who were into Asian guys (it's worth mentioning that east and south Asian men are seen as the least attractive in America). Being lower middle class and atheist hurt my chances as well. I'm now in California. When I lived in SF I actually felt attractive, having women hit on me, get handsy, etc. There, I was taller than average and people thought I was exotic because of certain aspects of my background. I also have had pretty good success with hook ups when I travel to big cities without really trying. Basically, if you have a racial handicap when it comes to dating, moving to one of the larger metro areas is your best bet.
Men, What are you trying to learn right now?	What the hell does もっとガバーッって mean in the context of a cheerleader who should spread her legs more in the performance. No fucking reference on the Internet about this ガバーッ stuff. Can't ask prudish friends because that might have NSFW connotations.	28 years old, I'm reteaching myself calculus on khan Academy so I won't be behind when I go back to college in the fall. Wish me luck! Edit: wow this blew up! Thank you guys for all the motivation! I'm working 50+ hours a week right now and coming home every night to "math homework" but I'm beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel!!
Have you ever had a dream that left you overwhelmingly sad once you've woken up ?	Every so often I dream that I can fly like Superman and the disappointment I feel when I wake up invariably casts a shadow on my day. Also for a whole after my last break up I found myself having these really shit dreams where I'd confront him and cry and be lame and shit, and they made me reasonably sad upon waking.	My dad died several years ago and there have been rare instances when I dream of him. Those are the worst possible dreams to have. I'll be aware of the fact that he's in my dream and then I'll catch him up on everything in my life as fast as I can and tell him I miss him but then he starts to leave and I wake up crying. I wake up crying because it's a terrible tease to see the person you love alive in your sleep. I'll try to go back to sleep just so that I can see him again but it never works.
Is a straight man not wanting to have a threesome with another man being selfish?	Nah, fuck that. A threesome is 2 girls and 1 guy. 2 guys and 1 girl is running a train. Source: Black Phillip.	If he's uncomfortable having a threesome with another man in it then I think she should accept that. But at the same time, if she's uncomfortable having a threesome with another woman in it then he should also accept that. I don't think it's hypocritical to say "I'm not comfortable having a threesome with someone of the same gender as me, but if you're comfortable doing it with someone as the same gender as you then I'd be interested in that". What's hypocritical would be saying "I won't do it but I expect you to".
How do I ask a guy out if I'm unsure of his sexuality?	> How would you feel most comfortable being approached like this? These is nothing that would make me comfortable about being approached in this setting. >Do I ask him if he's into guys? Please don't. Ask me about girls and see if I talk about girls. >Do I ask him out for a beer? Not with romantic intentions. Please don't. >f you knew a guy was into you but you're not like that would you feel comfortable being just good buddies after? No. It would be weird.	It's hard to say how he will react since different guys have different reactions to being hit on by a guy. First off, he should know you are gay. If he doesn't, find a way to let him know, and see how he reacts. You could also probe a bit to see what sort of people he is into by asking him what his "type" is/etc.
(UPDATE) How to tell boyfriend I have cancer?	I completely understand that he's upset, but he needs to have a better stress response than punching things. edit: disagree and downvote me all you want. I don't care. I've been in my share of stressful situations (though not this specifically, yet) and punched my share of inanimate objects. It doesn't help, and thankfully he didn't injure himself. Lashing out with violence doesn't solve anything, and can only make a stressful situation worse.	Please, give us an update every once in a while about your treatment! All the best towards this. life is tough, so are you. *Internet hug from a random stranger*
Men on medication for depression or Anxiety, what prompted you to seek out medication? What was life like before and what’s it like now?	Toxic masculinity says it is acceptable for her to do that, yes. My hope, though, is that I can help get her to a place where she is stable and healthy. Then she may be able to listen to me and handle more	Ativan is a wonder drug for shutting down anxiety when it’s overwhelming. It can stop you from pacing around a room crying for hours, let you sleep.
My SO wouldn't buy a virtual pet chicken in a game we play together. What things have your SO/family member/friends "done", to make you irrationally sad?	I get sad when my boyfriend doesnt wanna make out a little when we are both brushing our teeth. I get why he doesnt like it, but getting sloppily minty together is so fun!	My mom asks for a peanut butter sandwich when she comes over. I'm allergic. I have no peanut butter in my house. She gets pouty. So not only is she trying to kill me, but I've managed to disappoint her in the process. Edit: Folks, I'm not denying my mother food, I buy countless specialty items and bake for days just for her. She consumes everything then asks for PBJ and pouts. No, I'm not willing keeping an item in my house that can so easily kill me, sealed or not (I have sticky fingered children). I have almond/cashew butter (which she poo-poos).
Women: What are some things your ex boyfriends/husbands did that creeped you out looking back?	Was dating a guy and on the second date, he asked me, "How do you act when you're mad?" That should have been a sign to run. EDIT:// He turned out to be controlling.	He lied about his age. I was 18, he was 35 and said he was 27. He told me jokingly I was too old for him a lot when people asked about the age gap. He often would comment on girls being pretty and they were always too young...younger than me. He's now on the offender list.
You've suddenly been granted the ability to make your dog understand one concept. Besides "I love you", what do you want to tell your dog?	When you bark, you sound scary to people who don't know you! I know you're just excited about them, but for real girl, you sound vicious. You might wanna work on that.	Don't be scared. I'm right here when anything scares you and the list of what scares you is quite long but I'm here for you, babe.
For what reason do you believe that anyone would date you?	I have a high sex drive and like to be sexually adventurous. I care for my SO's problems and am tentative to relationship problems. I always like having a good time and am open minded.	I asked my girlfriend what she liked about me that made me worth dating. She said, and I quote: "You're nice, talented, funny, and honestly I actually liked you before you asked me out!" She went into depth about her crush on me, too. She told me the crush started "like a month before we actually started talking!". I was completely oblivious to her crush. In fact, I was telling her early in our friendship how oblivious I can be... she remembers that and she said to herself "You have no idea, lol". She also told me, and I quote: "I hated it when you didn't walk/scoot from jazz to marching band with me!" (For a while I rode a kick-scooter everywhere). She's my awkward little sweetheart and I love her so much ❤
AW in the US, who will you vote for for President and why?	I won't vote for Sanders. I would vote for Clinton. The morbid right-shoulder-angel wants to vote Trump just to watch a shitshow, but I won't. If he's the nominee, I won't vote Republican, same with Cruz E: Enough with the PM's and stuff. "Sanders-all-the-way" is not the only acceptable answer	This election makes me feel like the oldest sister in Poltergeist when she gets out of the car and screams "What's happening?!?!??"
What has been your "nice guy" experience?	I read some of these stories, women. I don't know if I'm an awful man or someone amazing but what I'm sure is that I'll try my best not to make the mistakes your "men" made. I will stick with my principles though but I'm opened to some changes if necessary.	I have a boss that is nice. He's been my boss one day a week for five years. He is devoted to his wife. She has advanced dementia. He is kind, thoughtful, faithful, sleeps in the same bed as his wife and does all of the cooking, cleaning, personal care for his wife and most home maintenance. I've stayed working there because as a single woman, I rarely see that. If I need any supplies, they are always there. It is a breath of fresh air.
Have you ever realized you were the abuser in a relationship? How did it end? How did it change you?	Please note that all rules are still in effect for this thread. This question is asking people about times when they were the abuser in the relationship. This means that they will be discussing abuse that they committed on other people. Derailing to berate them about it is not on topic.	Please note that all rules are still in effect for this thread.

My dog is a panty snatcher. What weird things do your pets do?	My sister's cat used to steal pens from around the house and hide them under the bed. We didn't figure it out for like a year when we moved her bed for some reason and there was a pile of at least two dozen pens sitting under it. We knew she liked to chew on them, had no idea she was stealing them.	Poops on construction signs and stop signs. Basically if its a street sign, he'll lift his leg up like he's about to pee, but poop on it. He's really anti authority I guess.
American men, in our current, social environment, of sometimes heated discussion over domestic violence and sexual harassment, do you sometimes feel like the enemy?	Sounds like *your* issue. Grow up. I treat my fellow man and woman well and I don't have some subconscious belief that my gender is evil or owes anyone anything. > makes me far less likely to approach women for fear of being labeled a harasser Now you're worried others share your irrational belief and will judge you from its perspective. I don't mind if crazy people think *I'm* crazy; I don't expect them to understand me. I'm a great fucking dude, I assume women are stroked when I give them attention. I don't harass them, I don't even care enough to waste the energy it would take to harass someone. But I'll talk to a women if I want to and I assume she's glad I did, the second I thought otherwise I'd just say goodbye and cruise on my way.	Every time I read "Teach Men not to Rape/ Harass/ Threaten Women." I know I'm not the problem (aside from not really doing anything to fix it, since there's not much I can do), but there are some feelings that can't be avoided. As proof, look how much of modern feminism is about "Not all women are x, don't group women as a single group, etc."
Women who chose a college major that everyone told you would be a bad idea - how did things turn out for you?	Undergrad: Scenography. It was the best time of my educational life, and I learned so much that's applicable to other fields and directly to life (like carpentry and electrics - those things are *useful* on a daily basis in a way that differential calculus never will be). I was constantly told that I should have gone into STEM (my graduate and post-grad degrees are STEM, btw) and that "doctors and scientists make life possible." I always retorted with "yes, but artists and the arts make life *bearable.*" I've had more theatre-related jobs than I have STEM ones, and I enjoy every moment spent working them.	I majored in social work and have a BSW. Everyone told me I would never make any money and here I am... in my 30s and still making $35k with $40k in loans. I am also just very burnt out on the bureaucracy and wish I had just majored in something more practical and lucrative like accounting.
Stealing this from AskWomen; What are the 5 best, and 5 worst things about dating you?	Best: 1. I'm fairly good looking and workout. 2. I rarely get mad and have a cool head almost at all times. 3. I like to think I'm funny and sarcastic. If you can banter you have my immediate attention. 4. I'm fairly open sexually though I do have a strict no outside parties or pegging rule. Otherwise game on. 5. I'm adventurous and a natural extrovert. Worst: 1. I can breakup with you fairly easily if certain issues or problems arise. 2. I can be stubborn. 3. If you play games I will play games back and mine I can assure you are better than yours. 4. I'm a bit of a sarcastic asshole. 5. I'm fairly blunt.	Best: I'm very cuddly. I can cook and enjoy doing it for someone else. I'm not bad at the whole sex thing. I'm laid back. I'm not going to cheat on you. Worst: I work stupid hours. I drink too much sometimes. I'm not exactly rich. I get distracted by dogs. I fall, fast.
For people that are shy when starting a conversation with a woman, how do you overcome this to make the opening interaction?	Practice on people you aren't interested in just to get used to talking to females. No problem if you "mess up" since you aren't trying to impress them anyways, it just helps you get over your anxiety.	I used to be much more shy and afraid to start conversations with girls than I am now but I always had a bigger fear of wondering "what if I didn't talk to her?" That drove me to giving it a shot and it usually turned out well. Sometimes didn't work out the best but rarely, if at all, ended horribly.
New ad campaign in NYC #manspreading? Not sexist?	If only there was some way of asking someone to make space for you, eg.: "Do you mind if I sit there?" This problem seems to have been created purely because people do not wish to make small-talk on trains and buses. Even a single sentence is too much. I mean, I get it, I'm incredibly lazy too, I just don't put up signs about it.	This is hysterical. If a guy is sitting with his legs spread and he's taking up too much room for you to sit down, all you have to do is say, "Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?" and, like magic, he will move his legs. End of story. Crisis solved.
Why more men play video-games than women?	Why does it matter? Who the fuck cares if more men play games than women? Are you upset that more women are into shopping in malls than playing sports? >And all women i met say that gaming is childish. Stop looking for validation from others and DO WHAT YOU ENJOY.	Your question shows only half the picture. Casual gaming is dominated by women these days. All these games that run on your tablet or smart phone, or browser games are mostly played by women. Console and PC gaming, where people invest hundreds of hours are more of a male domain. I think this has a lot to do with the content produced. I feel that games on consoles are specifically designed for a male audience. I'm having a hard time to find a game on Xbox that isn't built around a mechanic of *kill this thing* (and I am totally okay with that). I suspect that it tends to a secret power fantasy men have. As for the women who call gaming childish, most of them watch TV for hours or invest their time in some other fashion. What makes that so much better?
What's your biggest life struggle right now?	Trying to get a job so my parents don't kick me out. I'm 17 like damn guys. You could have warned me first. I thought I didn't have to work but apparently they've been holding it against me for a while. Wish people could just talk about what's bothering them.	A sense of lostness and lack of direction. Dwindling mental health. And the intense fear that sooner or later i’ll just stay asleep forever or grow bitter. I’m really scared
So I've been single for 8 years and sexless for over 10 years, it's having a huge effect on me mentally. How do you deal with this and stay confident/happy?	Focus on yourself and stop thinking about women and sex. Try to improve your life, your body or learn something you couldn't do before. Try something new that makes you proud of yourself. After a while you will become happy with your life which leads to confidence... and that's when a woman will come into your life naturally without even trying.	Thank you for posting this. I've been feeling very abandoned and alone lately for a same/similar situation, but I didn't know how to ask Reddit. This reading this post helps me feel a little less shitty from reading the comments. Thanks OP, thanks /r/AskMen
What are some healthy ways to feel and be more masculine?	A friend once told me something that I'll always keep in mind. "You are a man, anything you do is manly!" and it's true. Whatever you do just give it 100% and it will be manly, even if you want to be a pedicurist or ballerina, it is still manly!	* Build a campfire and prod it with a stick (you don't need to know why, just do it). * Open a tough to open jar, bonus points if it was handed to you by a woman who couldn't open it * Lift heavy stuff * Grunt
Men, what makes you want to see a woman again?	I’m a girl here and I know you didn’t ask me but I’m telling my right now it’s not you. Ghosting isn’t normal behavior and unfortunately, you have just been dating he wrong guys. A decent guy, ready to date, emotionally available will tell you directly they aren’t interested. So just keep that in mind you are not the problem.	Ok, this is a very introspective and lengthy topic. I dont think it is any one thing, you are doing ...other than attracting the same type of guy. Where do you meet these guys? Maybe if you got professional counseling it could help you tease this issue out?
What's a favourite thing your animal does, or a favourite moment you've spent with them?	Never had a cat. I've got 2 dogs now. The small one like to climb into my lap no matter what I'm doing. He sleeps best curled up behind my knees, and is currently "talking" to my husband. Hubby's ignored him today, and he wants attention.	My cat gives me eskimo kisses every morning when we wake up. He's so affectionate. I roll over onto my back and he stands on my chest. Purring like crazy. All I have to say is , "Can I have kisses?" and he leans over and rubs his nose on mine. He also does this adorable thing where he gets up in my arms and lays like a baby on his back. I give him belly rubs and he rubs his ear with his paw. When he's super happy he always rubs his ears. It's so cute.
What are some dating/relationship issues you see guys worrying about in films and on TV that aren’t worth worrying about in reality?	Uhm, isn't that like *most* such "issues" in films & TV? I mean really, it's generally there for the entertainment value ... not reality (and "reality" TV is anything but), and generally not a documentary. Sure, there are *some* exceptions, ... but they're that - exceptions - not the rule. Heck, I'm sure there must be *some* examples, but I can't quickly think of, off-hand, any dating/relationship issue of some guy in a film or on TV that would actually be worth worrying about in reality.	1. The whole meeting the parents freak out, I get being nervous but the movies make it seem hilariously doomed. 2. The demanding promotion, there shouldn’t really be any issues with this, do these couples not talk about what they’re trying to do with their careers? 3. The hot ex- boyfriend you run into at a bar while out with her, there’s a reason he’s an ex. 4. The first time he cooks her dinner, there’s always a fire or something. 5. How things get serious all of a sudden. In my experience it’s usually a gradual thing and not a surprise to either party. You’re just plodding along taking the logical next step. 6. The proposal. If you’re that serious about each other the M word comes up a lot. You would normally know where she stands on it. If you don’t then you shouldn’t propose. Edit: your/you’re
What was your last straw with a former friend, where you said I don't ever want to see this person again?	My friend was hanging out with a girl he knew I liked one on one and ended up making moves on her. He denied it when I brought it up. I just moved on at that point. I don't need that caustic behavior from strangers, let alone friends of years.	When I got home and his shot was moved out of our apartment and his dad had bought us out of the lease and he told me I had till the end of the month to find somewhere to live. This was after 6 months of eating my food, invading and disrespecting my space. And thinking that his girlfriend could run the apartment that she didn't live in.
Gents - how do deal with feelings of "lagging behind" in your life?	>Thanks baby boomers for a shit housing market. You are never truly an adult until you stop blaming your parents for your problems... You are adding to your problems. Instead of just wanting a house badly, you now have the problem of feeling angry, frustrated, and demotivating yourself. Everybody wants things they can't have or have when they want it. Don't punish yourself. Identify and focus on things you can control. Keep your attention there. You may not get the house any sooner, but you will not be making yourself miserable in the meantime. If you still don't feel better consider volunteering to help people out who aren't as well off as you. It really makes you feel better fast.	I’m in a very similar position to you in LA, but a year younger. Living life according to some arbitrary timeline isn’t going to get us anywhere. For me, nothing has worked out according to schedule anyways. But it has worked out! So what’s the rush? Your married friends with kids or houses may be wildly unfulfilled or feel trapped. Imagine when you’re an old 85+ geezer, will you really be concerned whether or not you had those things at 31 vs 35 vs 38? A few years here and there are nothing in a lifetime.
NSFW Girlfriends/wives who 'don't feel sexy' or are conscious of their appearance, how does this affect your relationship?	Do you touch and cuddle nonsexually? Sometimes, women want romance and intimacy before they can feel sexy. We need to feel loved and cherished. If your wife sincerely thinks you are lying when you call her sexy, she doesn't feel cherished by you.	It's tiresome when I initiate and tell her she's gorgeous and burn with desire for her but she throws it in my face and calls me a liar. It just doesn't work long term when she insults or rejects her partner for wanting her because she hates herself.
How true is, "If s/he likes you, s/he will make time for you," at different stages of dating/relationships?	It's true. There are legit claims to people that complain about their friend getting a new SO and then disappearing. That time has to come from somewhere. If you like someone enough you'll find ways to make it work. When SO and I started dating we lived an hour apart, he drove up every weekend, often during the week even, just to see me for a couple hours. Even if he was just sleeping in my dorm bc he was so tired. This was during his landscaping job where he'd have to wake up at 4 am just to make it back in time for work. It has not faded with time.	I would think this would be true at every point during the relationship. If you're really into someone you'll make time to be with them. Dating, SO, whatever. There can also be the other side of the extreme where someone expects the other person to always spend time with them.
What's your go-to healthy breakfast?	[The Budwig diet] (www.budwigcenter.com/the-budwig-diet/#.WVvq86dNfYU) On top I sprinkle a spoonful of bee pollen and two spoons of flax seed. When in the mood I add fruit. The Budwig mixture is for cancer patients but it is said to bring oxygen into the cells of your body. It has made my eczema disappear. The bee-pollen I eat because it tastes like the origins of honey and the image of bees flying around with the little bags of goody two shoes goodness stuck to their cute little legs.	I'm a big overnight oats person. Oats, yogurt/milk (I usually use almond because I'm sensitive to dairy) then a little maple syrup, fruit, cinnamon. Yum.
How many otters can I have before people started looking at me like that crazy otter guy?	One. Because no one goes out of their way to have an otter as a pet. Not even sure its legal...	Depends on which species of otter North American River Otter - 4 Asian Small Clawed Otter - 6 European Otter - 3 African Clawless Otter - 2 Sea Otter - 2 Giant Otter - 0
Dudes, have you ever broken it off with a girl because you found out she had a promiscuous past? Why, Why not?	Yes. I was with a girl and things were going well, super compatible lots of getting to know each other. But she had mentioned she had been with around 50 guys, which was about 5 times my number but I didn't want to make it a dealbreaker. But when things got hot and heavy and I fingered her she felt... wrong. Beat up or scarred or just messed up down there. And I went from ready to go to shriveled in just a few seconds.	Mostly because she admitted that she regularly performed sexual favors on her friends on a dare and that they regularly tried to get her to go further and further by getting her liquored up and testing to see if they could get her drunker than she thought she was. And she went back to the area those people were from for the summer to visit her family and had no plans to avoid them or to refrain from going drinking with them despite our relationship, which I parsed as "I'm planning on cheating on you and then using having gotten drunk as an excuse."
What are some seemingly innocuous things your parents said that messed you up more than they maybe thought it would?	Oh lawdy, I fear I am the asshole saying damaging things. Just today I asked her if she could use her paws to open a package for me, and she asked 'why do you keep calling my hands paws?" and I say **BECAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE A DOG!** Oh my, it still makes me laugh. But seriously I am constantly saying these mean things because it is incredibly funny and because that's my way of saying *I love you*.	They made a lot of complaints about my hair. I have curly hair and neither of my parents do, so I guess they didn't know what to do with it. They made disparaging remarks whenever we went somewhere together, like "Can't you run a comb through that rat's nest?" Of course, combing and brushing the shit out of it just made it worse, it got so frizzy and poufy. And then the icing on the cake is that when they adopted my sister, who is biracial, they went out of their way to find out how to care for her hair and buy whatever products she needed. And they'll rub it in my face (completely unaware of what they're doing) by comparing her hair to mine, "Oh her hair is just so gorgeous, don't you wish you had hair like hers when you were her age?"
Tell me about the worst boss/manager you ever had. What made them horrible? How long were you there and how did you get out?	My first manager was a horrible person in general. She smoked and drank redbull and who knows what else every day at work while being 8 months pregnant. Now her son is mentally handicap.	He would personally insult me on a weekly basis. "You graduated college?" "you sound like a housewife instead of an engineer." I tried various methods of agreeing with him, arguing with him until I gave up and would just walk away from him when he was being an ass. I lasted 1.5 years and said screw it because I caught my ex-husband cheating on me. So I left them both. Can't go to work to escape home, can't go home to escape work.
What is the dumbest thing you have ever said or asked?	Idk but yall motherfuckers need to learn how to let shit go. We have awkward interactions from time to time. We stumble over our words every so often. We make fools of ourselves now and again. Shake it off. No wonder there are so many sad sacks in the world	Extremely good looking cart girl on the golf course on a very hot day. She makes a comment about the weather. My attempt at flirting. "Are ya sweatin" she just looked at me like I must be special needs. Many years ago and I still cringe whenever I think about it.
How as your taste in women changed as you got older?	The older I get the more appealing are chubby women and the more appealing are huge butts and huge boobs. After being in a relationship for three years now, I also wouldn't ever want to date a girl who wasn't easy-going and accepting all my flaws. I always expected to have to hide a lot of my personality and sexuality when being in a relationship. I don't think I'd be willing to do that anymore nowadays.	I definitely stop trying to "save" my women. I used to be attracted to women who were in need of some kind of support. Now I want someone on the same level as myself.
For people so lose their appetite during depressive episodes, what’s the easiest way to maintain proper nutrients and self care?	I see a lot of milk suggestions, milk is not as good for you as people say, look it up it’s filled with bacteria. Drink almond/coconut/cashew milk instead, it’s filled with vitamins and way easier on a empty stomach.	When my wife was struggling with depression, we found that if I asked her "are you hungry?" or "can I get you something for lunch?" the answer would usually be "no". But if I asked her "could you eat a banana?" the answer was usually "ok". Letting the people in your life know if there's a specific food that you often find more palatable than others when you don't particularly feel like eating can be a real helpful thing to do.
Who’s a stranger you will never forget?	I live down the street from a farmers market. I was walking to it one day and out of nowhere an older women said hello sexy. I had in so I asked her to repeat herself and she said your a fine looking man. I was honored and caught off guard. I said awwee thank you and kept walking.	When I was a cashier a few years ago, there was a lady with three kids that ran out of food stamps. Keep in mind, this was around Christmas time when grocery stores are SLAMMED! She had me ring out $350 worth of groceries, but only had a balance of $50. She apologized, expressed there is some sort of mistake, started crying, and began to put things back in her cart for returns. An elderly couple behind them saw this and instead of being nasty and impatient, they told me they would be happy to pay for her groceries, insisted her 3 children pick out their own candy bar, and uploaded a $100 gift card for her. They gave her a hug and wished her a Merry Christmas! I will never forget such kindness, ever. It's little things like this that make Christmas such a special time of year 😊
What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?	I expect the one person I've given it completely to to treat my heart with enough care that it'd never be "absolutely broken".	We've been together since 2002. He knows my birthday means a lot to me. I don't ask for extravagant things or dinner at some 5 star restaurant. This year he, and our children (who are younger than 12) didn't do anything. I thought they were pulling my leg. Nope. I didn't even get a card. If I hadn't said it was my birthday they wouldn't have even wished me a happy birthday. He took me out for breakfast because we hadn't eaten, so it was just another day. It sounds stupid. But it hurt more than anything over the last 14 years with him.
What annoys you most about porn?	They are trying to get ppl watching tranny porn because they have a bunch of ads for it on pornhub and such they know ppl get desentizedd and want them to walk into hardcore shit that ppl wouldn't normally watch or lke if they didn't get their brains all screwed up	The camera changes so frequently that if you see a scene that's hot, you have to keep playing that five seconds over and over again because camera dude just has to find a different shot constantly.
What's your "blind spot"? In what areas of relatively common knowledge are you woefully ignorant?	I'm a computer scientist and I detest algorithms. Try to avoid them whenever possible as far as proofs go. I'm also pretty ignorant of geography.	I can't spell. At all. It just makes no sense! Some one in the IRC chat once told me they thought I was doing it on purpose. I wasn't. :(
I'm uncomfortable with escalating things physically with a girl unless she makes it extremely clear that she wants to. How can I get over this?	Don’t. These days, you run the risk of being called a rapist if you initiate anything without clear consent from a female.	Making out is a good sign, usually when making out you move your hands over her body. If you move your hand somewhere and she grabs it then you know that's off limits. It's all trial and error bud, I am not saying when you make out with every girl put your hands down her panties. I am saying test the waters and if she responses well then go further.
What do you think is the biggest lie that men tell themselves?	That getting married is a good idea. It's not - cohabitating with a woman is a very bad deal for men emotionally and financially. You will lose half of everything you own and will be limited access to your own children while your ex tries to turn them against you. Look around at all the men you know and you'll see how common that is.	"I'm fine, I don't need help," for anything in their head Or "This is normal, I don't need a doctor," for physical health issues
Women over 50, how is being a woman today different from when you where younger?	I feel like you should ask this in a group regulated frequently by said women. Look them up! They’re usually very helpful!	I had no option but to wear skirts to school until 8th grade. I couldn't take wood shop in high school. When I joined the Navy because I couldn't find a job outside health or childcare or food service, I was not allowed on ships. Nice girls didn't get tattoos, which is why "Show him the battleship, Janet" was so funny then. I remember when date rape had no definition or recognition. I was told if I accused him of rape, he'd get his friends to say they had all had sex with me too, so no one would believe me. That actually was a thing.
What have you guys decided on as your purpose in life?	>*We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.* **TL;DR** To make sure that my country remains a place that my kind are able to live & grow as intended by those insightful men who came before me.	To enjoy it. It's strange how time and age changes your outlook. When I was younger 18-26 all I wanted was money and flashy things. Now I'm 37 I want to relax. Earn less money but with much less stress and enjoy my hobbies and Enjoy time with my wife and dogs.
Why are there so many guys answering questions in askwomen?	Similar to women who answer on /r/askmen. They believe they have information that might help OP gain insight to whatever they want to know.	Honestly, it bothers me a little bit. But weirdly enough, it only bothers me when they answer the sillier types of questions. When serious questions pop up and they respond really contributing to the discussion, I don't mind and I usually appreciate their input. But when it is like, "women, what is your favorite book/movie/song/knitting pattern/whatever," it annoys me a little. Like, what is the point of men answering? It contributes nothing to what the OP asked, which is "Women, what is YOUR favorite [thing]." That said, its not like it deeply offends me. It just makes me roll my eyes. And I'm curious as to why they feel the need to have their voices heard in relatively unimportant matters.
Aside from blowjobs, what small everyday thing can a significant other do to make a man not feel taken for granted?	I don't mean to be funny here and I applaud you for trying, seriously, but if you have to ask what to do and then do it because you feel you have to it doesn't really count.	Just be active in the relationship. So many girls think its okay for the guy to do all the planning, buy her things, do this and that and she can just be sitting pretty. It's not about gifts, or anything like that. It's about the thought and gestures. Be equal in your love and you'll be good.
I just had a gorgeous nurse ultrasound my balls. What's the most uncomfortable situation you've ever been in?	I too had a very attractive, young doctor when I went to prep for my operation. It was extremely uncomfortable. My family doctor is also female and I very much dislike having her for a doctor. I would just much rather have male doctors as well. I would say the most uncomfortable situation I've been in recently is a female friend of mine has decided to be a bitch to a bunch of people the past 3 months and we haven't spoken in that time whilst working together until today, and it went badly..lol.	The first time I had a kidney stone and didn't know what it was I freaked the fuck out and drove myself to the hospital convinced I was about to shit my liver while pissing my lungs out. Hot chick doctor. No manscaping and my dick was turtling like a motherfucker cause it was cold and we were scared, so picture a super hot chick reaching through the tangled jungle of my pubic hair to find this tiny little penis trying it's best to suck up inside my body.
Is a bro's sister off limits?	Depends on the bro, but most would say "off limits". Edit: But ultimately, it's up to you and her if you guys want to be together. Most bros are just concerned that you're just trying to hit it and quit it. If you really care about her, and you show that to your bro, then he **should** be okay with you dating his sister. Edit: It'll still be a little awkward though.	No, BUT(!), you don't fuck with that chick and mislead her. I mean, you should already *not* mislead people, but especially your friend's sister.
I thought this was askMEN. NOT askmenandwomen. Why do we let this happen?	Alright alright, April Fool's joke time is over.....back to NO MORE FUN ALLOWED (and we don't want this joke post to become an actual drama post against other subs).

What small change have you made that really improved your day to day life?	Taking birth control. Only get my periods about 2-3 times a year now. I don't understand how some women worry about that stuff every single month! Doesn't it get obnoxious?? It's free with my insurance and I'm lucky to not experience severe side effects so there's really no negatives for me.	Got a kitten. Despite the upturn in small cuts and abrasions, he's soft and warm and his purring makes me really happy.
Men who have never gotten into a fight: do you feel like you want to? How have you avoided being in such a situation?	I've just simply said "whatever this fight'd be about, you win". They walk outside with their shirt off going "YEAH! YEAH! I DA MAN" and everyone else recognizes who the grownup is. I also don't attend rap shows, Hells' Angels bars etc so I'm pretty good.	Living in America in a big city, I have no desire to get in a real fight. You just have no idea what people are carrying around these days. Any knife or gun and you may not come away alive. That said, I'm currently entertaining the idea of learning boxing and joining a boxing gym since sparring looks fun.
Should I break things off so early on due to difference in sex drive?	2 weeks? You deserve someone who makes you feel attractive and wanted, life is too short to settle for someone who only thinks you're good looking enough to have sex with once every 2 weeks.	Life is short, op. seriously. If I had a to do over, I wouldn't put up with that stuff. If you haven't been going out for very long, find someone else... Or at the bare minimum do not make it exclusive.
What would you think if a girl had to tell you she was dead in the middle of hooking up?	I like the fact that this is the currently highest post in the sub because of that typo Also, I would laugh my ass off if I accidentally knocked your magnets off and would then proceed with the fun	The more awkward you get about it, the more awkward it is. If your response to it is: "Oh my goodness I'm so embarrassed, I hate when this happens, I hope you're not freaked out by this, I knew I should have told you earlier, etc, etc", then it's going to be awkward. If your response to it is: "They help me hear. Don't stop.", it's really, *really* not going to matter. That's just my opinion, but I'd think most guys would feel similarly.
What friend or schoolmate from your childhood turned out exactly the way you thought & who did a complete 180?	The one who turned out in the exact way I figured was, ironically, my sister. She got pregnant youngish (18), baby daddy ran off with someone else, and occasionally pops up to act like he's been a good dad. She's now married with 3 kids, and an alcoholic husband. I feel terrible for her, honestly . The 180 case was a guy who I had a major crush on. He was so nice, incredibly good looking, and super friendly. I recently heard, from a friend of mine, that he's still single, and works on oil rigs!	A high school classmate, who was so driven and adamant about never having kids. She was top of the class, head girl, had her choice of athletic scholarships, and academic scholarships. She went off to study aeronautical engineering at a top school. She dropped out of school, studied theatre for a while, but never finished. She travelled for a bit, and then returned home to open an ice cream shop. She now runs her store, and is the mother of twins with another baby on the way. Never ever saw that coming.
How risky is it to ask a close female friend on a date? And if you ever did so, what was the outcome?	There's no such thing as a "close female friend" unless she's your cousin. Go for it if she's datable OP.	It's difficult to know the exact level of risk, but there's three main options. 1. she says yes and you see where that goes. 2. she says no, things may be awkward for a bit, but friendship endures. 3. she freaks out and your friendship ends either immediately or after not very much time has passed. Of course, after that three-pronged fork, there's other ways things can end, such as if she says no but things were going fine until she meets someone she does want to date and you can't handle it and have to distance yourself from her or cut off contact.
Do you use your sick pay days and when you're not really sick, what are your reasons?	No such thing as sick days in my country, but I do occasionally stay at home without a good reason. Sometimes if I'm feeling a bit unter the weather, sometimes if I need a mental health day, sometimes if I just can't be arsed and have better plans to spend my day. At my job it also doesn't *really* matter. I should technically be in when I'm supposed to be in, but as long as my hours at the end of the month are fine noone cares.	My company just has a set amount of PTO days (paid time off). We can use them for whatever we want, no justification or explanation necessary. I often use them to just have a relaxation day, mental health break, a clean the house and run errands day, escape down the coast day, etc. One time I even used one to stay home and play the new Zelda video game for like 12 hours straight.
Men, what incompatibilities do you think are okay to have in a relationship and what are not?	It's not OK if one of you is awake and the other is not. I mean that in a Buddhist sense.	Different taste in music: easy difficulty Different taste in food: medium difficulty Different taste in humor: hard difficulty Different values: legendary difficulty
What hobbies in a guy are a total turn-off?	This thread has been locked because apparently people can't read a thread about deal breakers/turn offs without being personally offended that someone wouldn't date them.

How does one realistically date someone who's way more attractive than they themselves are?	I think sexual marketplace value absolutely exists. But I also think a person can change their SMV. How does a 6 land a 9? Well first off there's a great compatibility between 6s and 9s due to their complementary orientation but I digress. The way a 6 lands a 9 is he improves himself to the point where he's a 9 himself.	Looks are important, anyone who denies it is an idiot, however it's your personality; hobbies; confidence etc. that will keep you together in the long run. All those can make up for your looks, however this only works to an extent. Good personalities, confidence and being interesting won't help if you're 300 lbs and don't shower.
If your pet was the star of a Pixar movie, which famous actor would be playing its voice?	Willen Dafoe, but with helium added so it's real high pitched voices Migde, and anxiety ridden 17-lb mutt. Special appearance by Ray Liotta, who will voice my baby/Midge's partner in crime. Midge would be trying to take over the world, but all attempts would fail as she continually would get distracted by crumbs and granola bar wrappers. Baby would continually get annoyed with Midge, only to laugh hysterically at her obsession for food. I imagine small vignettes of her failed adventures instead of one, feature-length film.	David Attenborough would be my cat's voice. He is an old man whose only joy is looking out of the window for hours at a time (briefly interrupted by morning meal, evening meal, and snack time). He would narrate the whole movie as he observed the intricate drama of the backyard squirrels and blue jays. At the end of the movie he would leave the window, shaking out his stiff joints, and discover that I was sitting on the part of the living room couch he considers "his." The camera would dolly in on his face as the audience absorbed the tragedy of old age.
Women who have relied on food donations during their lives, what would you have liked to receive? What would you beg people not to donate?	I’m a social worker. I hate to see junk food donated to my clients. What I’d like to see are a good variety of nutritious basics that appeal to most people: fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grain bread, protein and dairy, reasonably healthy snacks like whole grain crackers. Basically, if it would pass WIC standards it’s good, if not, please don’t force people living in poverty into a slow death and compromised health by donating food with little to no nutrition.	donate money to food banks, then they can get what they need. Most food banks buy bulk at wholesale prices, so even if you give food they need, chances are the foodbank can get more food from your donation if you donate cash. If you donate food and it's not what the foodbank needs, they must sell it (probably very cheaply) and use the money to buy something else, again your money goes further if you just donate money.
Do you feel like you have to appear as nonthreatening as possible?	I'm 173lbs, 5'10" and pure muscle. The only way I can be "unthreatening" is if I'm wearing a banana suit. Not doing that.	Yeah. I'm big. If you're an average sized woman I'm massive. Throw in the beard and real wide shoulders, if I'm a little bit messy I see people cross streets to avoid me. In my winter coat with a watch cap I look exactly like a batman henchman - just a generically large mean person who probably does crimes. So, I try to speak softly. I say "Oh goodness!" when I hear a story about an outlandish circumstance, smile a lot, and am especially polite. This appears to put people at ease and make them more comfortable around me. I consider it a courtesy, just broadcasting that I'm a sweet person not a mean one.
Women who have used online platforms to make friends (Meetup, Bumble BFF, etc.), what has your experience been?	I made one female friend online. We were friends for a good while, but she was actively dating through the app as well and would ghost me for her new partner whenever anything went past a few dates. So it didn’t last. She was a cool girl, though.	I used bumble bff for a while last summer when I moved to a new city. I realized that it's WAY harder to approach women than men. It was also pretty frustrating how sluggish the conversations were, they didn't really go anywhere and we always stopped talking after messaging back and forth a few times. Most profiles on there seemed to be inactive and a lot of them were very similar. I felt like most of the girls were just trying to get others to join their MLM schemes or gain followers on instagram.
Men who have done steroids in the past, do you regret it? Why or why not?	My best friend had little man syndrome (5'5") and thought taking steroids and "getting big" would make up for it. He started taking Russian steroids orally (There was a lot juice going around my gym). I told him that he had no idea if they were legitimate (only Russian on the packaging - they could have been horse steroids) and that taking them orally would fuck up his liver. He got big, turned into an asshole, got married, had a kid with deformities, got bitch tits, beat his wife, got - you guessed it - liver cancer, and got small and died.	I had a theoretically weak heart. Took steroids for over a year before I had a check up, and then the new doctor basically told me that the previous doctor was an idiot and I never needed them. Fuck doctors, kickbacks, and general assholery.
Have you ever assumed family member or friend's engagement wouldn't work out? What ended up happening?	yeah.. my good friend got married in a hurry some years ago. a couple other friends of his and i made bets on how long it would last. marked it on the calendar. I won. he was a good guy, and she was a pretentious fluff of a woman. "model", or thought she was.	My sister dated a guy for 3 years that I never really liked...i thought he didn't treat her right and he was kinda of a drama magnet. She was taking about how she wanted to marry him and all this. And then she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma like three weeks after telling me she hoped Eric* would propose. He dumped her after her first chemo treatment because it was all too much for him. He also cheated on her. There is a good chance she would have murdered him if she was well. /* calling him that because that's his name.
Men who have met their GF through dating apps, what was your first message?	Cringe worthy, im 29 shes 43 now and i said like, I have i huge penis and ill make you squirm all night. Turns out she didnt give a fck but engaged me in conversation and i turned out to be romantic as fck. Together 5 yesrs now.	We met on Tinder, and his first message was in response to a question in my bio (what's your favorite book?). He was the first person who took it seriously and clearly put thought into his answer. We went on a date, and mutually agreed that we weren't looking for anything serious. 9 months later, every time I ask him how the casual thing is going, he tells me to shut up.
I lose my shit whenever I see "upvoted because girl" comments on Reddit. What Reddit behavior makes you irrationally angry?	Political correctness complaints in comedy subs. Sure, some humor goes too far, but when done well everything is fair game. You don't like it? Don't visit comedy subs. I feel like every time I finally find a place that shares my sense of humor there's always that one person who's only there to whine and complain about how offensive everything is.	this is specifically an /r/sex complaint, but ones where a woman makes a comment to the effect of: 'I adore my guy, but he doesn't like receiving blowjobs, and I enjoy giving them, and I never expected that and kind of miss it' happens fairly often, to be fair it probably the same one or two people responding every time but there is always, always some secondary comment response the effective of: 'You must release yourself from this relationship, you blowjob unicorn, so that you can be free to serve all the men who desire blowjobs! there are so many of us and we are all alone and blowjobless, you poor scarce resource you!' I bet I sound completely ridiculous right now but it *happens* and I hate it.
What is a flaw in your SO that you can overlook because you love them?	He is short, not shorter than me but I can’t wear heels around him which sucks but I overlook it	He looks at a comic or a meme or video or gif or whatever on his phone and then laughs and locks his phone and sets it down then DESCRIBES IT to whoever he’s with. JUST SHOW THEM THE THING. SHOW THEM. *THE THING.*
How do I convince myself I'm good enough for a SO?	Listen to that voice and work on urself. If that voice is saying ur ugly then go to the gym. If that voice Is saying ur poor then make more money. Etc etc...	What works for me is realizing that the girl I'm dating isn't some undesirable piece of trash. If she didn't feel like I was worth spending time with rather than her hanging out with friends, meeting new guys or whatever it is, then she wouldn't. That means the things she deems important in a partner are present in me so no matter what I think of my qualities, she sees them differently.
Do attractive men get hit on as much as we think they do? How do you react to compliments?	So I have a relatively high number. However, I still know that I have blown more opportunities than I have closed the deal on. I get hit on more than I know but I refuse to inwardly acknowledge because I have a lifetime of sabotaging my own success. I still continue in life like I’m shit and delusionaly rationalize away all compliments. I get enough pussy I guess but I could do better.	It’s weird because the role is usually guys make the first move or initiate some sort of conversation when they find a woman attractive. When you’re a good looking guy, more gay guys hit on you than women......it’s such a cosmic joke fml.
What insult have you received that took you aback with how cutting but entirely accurate it was?	This was yelled at me by an angry driver, "Well...you're Asian." I mean, on the level? He's not wrong. I'm in fact Asian. The fact that he said it to be derogatory, just set me off. Having lived in So Cal all my life and grown up in an area with a high % of Asians, I had never experienced real racism till that moment. Thinking about still makes my heart rate go up.	"You need this relationship just as much as I do" I have been discussing breaking up with my SO, and I was telling them how i felt like a therapist to deal with their issues and how I felt the relationship was entirely one sided because I helped them with their life and problems but I wasn't getting anything out of it They astutely pointed out my life was really empty and I used supporting my SO to get a sense of purpose and an ego trip from being needed, and we were both equally responsible for the relationship becoming codependent Well, they were completely right. I ended up breaking things up and taking a few months to work on myself before getting into another relationship.
Why did Rory end up with Logan when Jess was clearly the best option for her?	Rory ended up with Amy. Kind of necessary for the sake of the universe, since Melody had to be born, yadda yadda. Logan... Well, I havne't seen the movie. I thought Nick and Jess got together? Haven't seen New Girl.	I hate that I know what this means but all I care about is that Kirk is happy and successful doing whatever grand plan he comes up with.
What's the worst/best pun/dad joke you know?	Slightly NSFW: Did you hear about the man who performed oral sex on himself and exploded? I guess you can say he, *blew himself to pieces*.	What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot. I told that joke and my dad thought it was **hilarious**. Edit: I've been a dad myself for 9 years and my best rated comment is now a dad joke.
I'm in your city/town. I have $20 USD and I want to get a sandwich (or regional equivalent), a bag of chips/crisps, and a drink. What am I buying?	Five Guys cheeseburger with more fries than you can eat by yourself, and a fountain soda. Served in a grease-spotted brown bag, which is their trademark. DC.	San Antonio. You're getting a plate of greasy tex-mex cheese enchiladas and a way-too-large margarita. Chips and salsa will be waiting for you when you sit down at your table.
As a man, how do you manage the loneliness?	Invest in good headphones & update your playlist, walk around at night on the weekend & when you see a bar with your people go in, order tequila & wash it down with half a pint. Finish the pint next to a group of your people. If they make conversation great, if not take another beer & try another eye contact. Rinse and repeat.	Been there, and I’ll tell ya, you’re going to want to make some friends. Loneliness can get away from you real quick, and go real bad.
What is an assumption foreigners make about the people from your country but you are/do very different than their assumption?	That American food is all hamburgers, hotdogs, and pizza. Our cuisine is eclectic, drawing on many different cultures and putting our own spin on it. These 'bastardizations' as some people call them are valid in themselves. Also in my part of the country people are incredibly polite. I'm from Florida and I kinda hate Georgia (the state) because they're so rude and nosy. Edit. Florida's actually quite sane, the reason there are so many crazy stories about Floridians is because the police are fast and lose with arrest records and the press can get to these stories without the consent of the people involved. Your state is just as crazy as mine, your police are just a bit more tight lipped.	Not all Canadians are polite and nice. And they don't realize that the bagged milk and certain pronunciations are regional things. And they underestimate how varied our geography and climate is. We do say eh and sorry a lot though
What is the the #1 thing that most guys don't realize about women?	It takes a lot to make all of "this" happen every day. Leg shaving, moisturizing, makeup, outfit, hair, etc. Most girls can't roll out of bed and look the way they would need to to feel comfortable going out. Take a minute to tell a girl she looks nice today. If you notice a friend/coworker/your girlfriend changed something about her appearance and you think it looks nice, tell her.	The #1 thing in my life is that not all women are the same. Just because a woman acts the same in the slightest as another woman some men who I have spoken instantly classify as a type they've dealt with before. That is untrue. Woman are the same, alike and different in various ways. It's like classifying a disorder; you have to have a certain amount of the Specific symptoms and degrees of it in order to classify Someone.
How often do you have sex vs how often would you prefer to have sex?	Whenever I can and way more. When I get to be with my "FWB," I guess you'd call him, we have sex anywhere from six to nine times a day for three days, but I'd prefer at least steady two a day every day.	I have sex once or twice a month, at the moment. It's usually once a week. I prefer every day, maybe every other day and 2-3 times a day on weekends.
Dear Women, have you ever been in a happy relationship but just felt that longing to be single? How did it come about for you?	Every once in a while I think it would be nice to be single. Usually comes up if someone attractive is flirting with me.	I really liked (like?) dating. I love the feeling of meeting someone new and thinking “wow, something might come of this!!” I like first kisses. I like going on dates. I like waiting for their text the next day. But I guess when it comes down to it, I like my boyfriend more. I have fond memories of dating, and it will just be that.
What's your partner's biggest flaw? Have you learned to accept it, or are you holding out hope they'll change?	He has a terrible temper. I haven't accepted it, but I'm also not holding out hope that he will change because he has changed and is changing, it's just been a process. It's one of those things that has always been a problem - it's a way his depression manifests. His parents were pretty terrible in terms of raising a challenging kid. It's genuinely amazing what a little Prozac and patience have accomplished.	He's a bit of a conversational bull in a China shop. Like, he starts talking and he just doesn't stop, it's impossible to shift the topic or insert an anecdote or segue to something else. He just keeps talking... everyone will be done with dinner and his food is cold because he can't stop. I thought maybe on our first date he was just a nervous talker, but this is how he is. He probably won't change, and I'm okay with it for the most part, because I can play pokemon while we walk and he talks. I've become a bit more forceful to engage with him and help others around him jump in and actually have a conversation rather than listen to a lecture.
How do I tell my girlfriend that it makes me uncomfortable when she talks about sexual experiences with different guys over the years?	Well actually she could have worded it better and made that position a suggestion, rather than saying "ohh with such and such he was so good at this position" It's almost verging on emotional abuse, jealousy. THAT is a bad thing since it makes you feel this way. How long have you two been together? Is this the first time you've ever felt this way about something she has told you about? Tell her how you feel about these things. Everyone has a past, not many people want to know about the intimate details. I had a girlfriend until recently that, when we first started dating, would gloat about these kind of things, even point at apartment buildings where she had had ONS's. Guess what, 11 year later it still makes me sick thinking about it. That's emotional abuse.	"Hey -- it makes me uncomfortable when you talk about sexual experiences with different guys over the years. We both have a past, and that's fine, but I don't need details."
Which Disney couples are most likely to divorce?	I would hope Mulan divorces her husband and find someone more accepting of her desire to not adhere to gender roles.	Cinderella and Prince Charming shared one dance and a few minutes for a shoe fitting. When Prince Charming listens to her stories about her mice friends and her fairy godmother, he is probably going to assume that she is mentally insane.
If a girl unexpectedly gets her period while in your bed the morning after a one night stand and has no pads/tampons/cups/etc with her: what's the protocol?	Happened to me about a month ago. Post coital, blood spots on my $200 sheets. Needless to say, she wasn't invited back.	Oh gawd, this happpened to me when I first started seeing my SO. I got out of bed and was reaching for my clothes on the chair when I felt the first trickle. Then, it started gushing. I've been having my period for 8 years now and even I wasn't prepared for the amount of blood - it was like a crime scene between my legs. I couldn't have been more mortified. Even worse, I had chosen not to wear knickers the previous day to surprise him (ladies if you do this, have a spare in your bag). He took it like a champ. He grabbed tissues, helped me mop up the blood on the floor, lent me one of his boxers, sent me straight into the shower and went out to get tampons, coffee and chocolates. And most importantly, never brought it up again.
For women who are not in a monogamous relationship, how exactly is the relationship structured?	We are an average couple where sex with others is allowed. When I first started dating him I was in a relationship with another man, I was sleeping with and seeing them both regularly. No one belongs to anyone. Ever.	I'm poly in a V with two men. They're not in a relationship with one another but are good friends. We all live in the same apartment. They're free to have other partners.
How did you last upset a lot of people on Reddit?	I said that I might marry a safe option who I wasn't deeply in love with because I don't want to be poor when I'm old.	I said it was kinda weird for a 16 year old girl to want to sit on her dad's lap all the time. Not sexual weird. Just kinda weird. I've never seen so many angry replies in my life.
Adult women of Reddit, how did you stop waking up exhausted? Put another way- how do you wake up energized and excited for the day ahead?	Ever since I started drinking, I wake up too hung over to feel tired. I'm just super disoriented instead, which I prefer since it's requires less work.	Go to bed earlier. I *need* 8 hrs of sleep. If I don't get it, nothing is going to help me be perky in the morning. Having a consistent morning routine still gets everything done, but if I'm even slightly sleep deprived I won't enjoy it. Now days when I go to bed nice and early and sleep really soundly, those days I'll wake up naturally before my alarm goes off. I'll snuggle with my dog for a few moments and then roll out of bed to start my morning routine and not feel rushed.
Will your life be affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed? How?	Hey folks. I get that the Affordable Care Act is an American law. However, it has enough of an effect on the healthcare industry, which stretches beyond the US borders, that its repeal could easily effect more than Americans. For example, a Canadian or Mexican healthcare worker that sees "health tourism." Due to that, the question stands. Thank you.	Hey folks. I get that the Affordable Care Act is an American law.

Women whose SO practices a different religion - how do you celebrate the holidays?	the mitigating factor within the premise of the question itself is that if the two people are of different religions yet married (or stayed married) to each other, then they were probably not very religious to begin with, if at all really.	I'm Jewish and he's Catholic, but neither of us are very religious. We light Hanukkah candles and have a Christmas tree (no angels or baby Jesus decorations). When we got together, I was so excited to celebrate a traditional Christmas with a feast on Xmas eve, and then I found out that his family doesn't cook and orders Chinese food instead! Such a disappointment.
What do you think of Creedence Clearwater Revival?	Eh. I'm sure there are ccr songs I would like, but it just always seemed kind lame. Never really given them a chance though, so who knows.	They're one of my go-to bands to play at social gatherings. Like, how can you have a bad time listening to CCR?
I share a cubicle wall with someone annoying, who among other things, plays music loudly through a bluetooth speaker. Rather than deal with this maturely how I can subtly mess with this person?	If he leaves his jacket on his chair, wipe your arse on his collar. He'll be smelling your ripper all the way home!	Get your own bluetooth speaker, set it to the same volume, and play the exact song they're playing... out of sync by however long it takes you to recognize and find the song.
How do you love and accept your body when we are all set against such high standards to look perfect?	I tell myself that both genders are now being expected to look a certain way. Even men now are expected to look a certain way.	I struggle with my body imagine but I just try to be kind to my body and remember that me being healthy is what's important. Whenever I'm insecure about my face or whatever it might be, I remember how complex the human body truly is and how lucky I am to have a healthy one that is capable of almost anything. I try to focus on my positive features like my cute smile, bright brown eyes, etc. I find that being in a good place mentally helps with accepting my body.
Have you given more or received more oral sex during your life?	Given. All the men in this thread bragging about how much they go down on their SO are making me feel ill. I want to comment 'congratulations' on every single one of them. Prime example of extrapolating your personal experience to apply to everybody, ever.	Given. I find men treat getting oral sex as a stand alone item and giving oral sex as occasional foreplay.
What's an aspect of female anatomy you are surprised many men or women don't know about or are overly squeamish about?	I'm beyond the point of surprise, but too many men and women are insufficiently aware that "female anatomy" is a meaningless term since many women have penises and many vulvas are attached to men.	I hate to generalize but I think a lot of men just think 'Tits are great!' and don't realize what a burden they can be or how much they can hurt at times. My SO doesn't really take it seriously when I mention they are super sore and can't be fiddled with.
Men who are now in great shape, what do you wish you knew when you first started?	Protein shakes and most supplement stuff is useless, save maybe Fish Oil. 200 mg of test will also make you feel like a champ and work as birth control as well.	That the routine is the hardest part, not the workout. The hardest part of a run is lacing up your shoes. Make it a priority and don’t let anyone get in the way of that and you’ll be shocked at how fit you get. Source: solid marathon, Ironman and adventure racing times.
If someone considers you their friend way more than you consider them your friend (i.e. unbalanced friendship) what should that person do?	Find a new friend. . . . Bro, I used to genuinely believe people on reddit were more intellectual than other social media platforms.	I'm going through this currently, primarily with my female friends, particularly as they almost never initiate. Basically, if someone considers you a good friend of theirs, but in your mind they're just a casual acquaintance, and their actions indicate that (i.e. always hitting you up, inviting you places) what would you want them to do? Clarify the situation, back off a bit, etc.?
How do you playfully mess with your SO?	Walking down the street on a rainy day. Found a child's sock on top of a fire hydrant. Put it in her mouth. The look was priceless	I will explain the punch line of jokes on tv, and when he says "I know", I say "you know NOW", while patting his hand affectionately, "because I explained it to you".
Men of Reddit, if you were on a fourth date making out with a girl, and she tells you she experienced SA when she was younger, does this scare you off, or how do you react?	Maybe that's not the right time to tell people that you had an uncle bad-touch, homie. Try doing it when his dick isn't hard.	as someone who also had SA when i was younger, it would make me feel awesome if someone shared that with me. i still have major intimacy issues as well, and it would help me to feel understood and less judged. on that note, he maybe just doesn’t have the same experience and feels like he doesn’t understand your hang ups. imo, you did the right thing by telling him because it’s an important thing to know about you. i’m sorry to hear that he doesn’t seem to be accepting of that ):
Men of reddit, how unlikely are you to date a woman who is looking to settle down and have kids in the next couple years?	The issue you'll run into is the usual narrative: "I screwed around in my early 20s with shitty guys and now I'm past my prime I want to settle down with someone I'm marginally attracted to with a stable job to support me and my children." To most guys this reads as settling for a wallet, whether or not that's what you specifically are doing.	You have to make him feel that you want a baby with him, not that you want a baby and .... eh... He'll do the trick.
What was your worst first date like?	I saw one on another worst date thread but this guy was driving the girl home after the date and she says ooooo what's this proceds to pull emergency brake on the freeway.	Ran into my old grade school crush when we both attended the same college. Turns out she'd had a crush on me in grade school too. First date we were going to the mall to see a movie and do some shopping. Something came up and we had to skip the movie. Then we bought baby mice to feed her snakes, which was kind of weird. We went back to my place, made out for a bit, but she had to run home before her mice thawed out. And then, she ghosted on me. Which was pretty hard considering we had classes in the same building and she lived two houses down from my parents.
I objectify women a lot and I want to stop. How?	I think you just need to have sex.... all other comments are also great advice, But serious op, you need to get this out of the way. Most posts on here seem to want to repress you sexual urges. lol, Good luck with that.	Try making friends with women you find unattractive. In your post, I wonder if you literally don't even **see** those women. Because that's something we notice as well. There are some guys that walk into a room and just go all heat-seeking-missile on the hottest girl- who ironically is probably the MOST annoyed by that behavior, making her and everyone else write him off as a creep. It'll be easier than trying to make friends with women you want to bang. Plus women in general will stop writing you off as a toolbag.
In your experience, how do the women in your life (not close family) react when you open up emotionally or display vulnerability/weakness in front of them?	This whole men can’t show their weakness thing is totally perpetuated by men. Women don’t thing less of you if you show your emotion. They embrace and prefer it.	Did not go well. They may be supportive at first but after that they start distancing themselves from me and eventually things end. It's very frustrating because i'll constantly listen and be supportive of their issues but the moment I bring up mine suddenly it's a turn off. As men sometimes all we need is just someone to talk to. This literally just happened too. I was seeing a girl who was fighting a spell of depression, I was always there trying to be supportive. She said she wanted me to open up to her. So I did tell her what I was dealing with. She was very supportive in that moment but in the following weeks much more distant and started being rude to me as well. last night I found out she started seeing another dude
What is something your SO has done, that you've forgiven them for, but affected your self esteem?	Ex SO for me but we had decided to have a baby during Xmas. I was all ready for the sex etc. What did he do, he rejected my every attempt for a month. He said he needed time to think it through even though we had already made the decision. Mind I say he was the one who said to me "let's make one of these for ourselves" while holding his sister's baby girl on Xmas. I'll never forget the feeling when I had dolled up in sexy lingerie etc. And he rejected me walking out of the living room. I got so miserable I through the sexy lingerie into the trash and did no attempt anymore. We did finally get pregnant after several months.	He bought me a dermaroller for our first Christmas together because he didn't like the acne scars on my cheek. Although it made me feel self conscious about my face, I forgave him. He's an extremely kindhearted person; just oblivious at times.
If you ever ghosted anyone (especially if you were in an actual committed relationship), how do you feel about it now?	Done it so many times I can't even remember them all. I don't really care because it's over the internet - it doesn't feel like real life, even though it has real life consequences.	I dated a girl for about a month when I was 19 who wasn't on the pill. During sex she kept telling me to finish in her then broke down crying when I didn't. Needless to say I didn't talk to her afterwards. She didn't really try to contact me much afterwards, I think she understood that I didn't want to put up with that crazy shit.
To those with SOs that work long hours and come home tired regularly: what can they do to reassure you they love you?	So let me get this straight: The person who works long hard hours and comes home tired is the one responsible for the other persons lack of self-esteem?	My bf heats water for my tea when he gets up before me, always comes in to wake me up/say goodbye (depending on my plans for the day) and lastly ALWAYS cuddles me for a couple of minutes when he gets home so we can talk about the day and such
Ladies, what's the silliest thing you do with your SO?	It's not what I do, but sometimes randomly my BF will act like he is running from me in an overdramatic way, and will go and hide. For no reason at all. But it makes me laugh every time.	My boyfriend likes to take my hands while talking to me and when I'm off guard he'll make them go through the motions of the macarena and I'm always slow to catch on. He finds it hilarious.
How would you feel about being a house husband?	Not a relationship that would last long. Women are often the prime enforcers of social norms and most of the stories I've heard end with the woman seeing the man more and more as a lazy parasite	I want to be one. My wife and I are expecting our first in June. She makes more money than I do and I have wanted to be a house husband. I never had a dad and since we started trying I've been wanting to be a more involved parent than a night time and weekend parent(breadwinner). I want to be full time.
What is the worst haircut you've ever got?	Similar thing. Was growing my hair long from a pixie. Hair dresser ruined my gorgeous long hair... it was just awful. So I chopped it all off again.	Already awkward and ugly 12 year old me let my aunt cut my bangs. I looked like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber all summer. Thanks Aunt Rosie!
What was your "take this job and shove it" moment?	First job. Wendy's. 7am. Cutting up onions for prep. Mascara all over my face. Told my boss I was taking a break and just got in my car and left. No regrets.	My manager expected me to go in to work the day after my nana died. When I said I wasn't going in, she said ''it wasn't your mum, you need to be here.'' I quit on the spot.
Husbands of reddit, what advice would you give a man before he gets married?	Don't pick fights, but also don't concede everything. You need to keep things that are yours and that you like. She'll likely assault all things that you own. Doesn't matter that she has 20 boxes in storage, she'll ask you to reduce your one box of storage and feel justified doing so. Stay firm. Also, tell her sex once a day is your baseline.	"Don't stop dating your wife. " - Chris Rock Just because there's a ring on the finger doesn't mean you stop planning nights out together.
AskMen, what would you say the most common mistake is that women make in a relationship?	It's not one thing... it's like a web of shitty mistakes women make that all involves... well, self-centerdness. Things that I've experienced and seen with pretty much most women these days (note I said most, not all): * Bringing nothing to the table except their presence and vagina. * Overestimating their own market value. * Underestimating their man's market value. * Entitlement, entitlement, entitlement. * Selfishness. * Thinking they're the star of the show. * The relationship is all about them, and what they want, and their "journey", making them happy. * Making it all about their feeeeeeewings. * Piss poor communication. I've noticed this more from women than men despite the stereotype. Expecting the man to be psychic. * Trying to be in charge of the relationship. No.	Not being honest about their problems. If you have a problem with our relationship, pretending there isn't one isn't going to fix it. *Be honest with me about your concerns and we can fix it together.*

Fellow European men, when reading /r/AskMen, what are the biggest differences you perceive between European and American men?	To be fair, the US is just as vast and varied a culture as we have in Europe. Seems strange to pit one against the other. But in saying that I don't think there's as heavy a culture of "status" here as there seems to be in a lot of instances described on this forum and others I've read. Salaries and whathaveyou, especially in regards to dating, seems almost alien to me.	It's much harder for us to drive to Canada. Also, height seems to be a much bigger deal for guys in the US.
The older I get the shittier the world seems. Anyone else? How do you deal?	The world has always been shitty. You realize it more as you get older, and especially as social media becomes more prevalent and Facebook politicians come out of the woodwork. BUT GUESS WHAT!!! The world is also amazing. There are people who work to make the world better every day. Focus on those people, and HELP those people.	The world has always been shitty.

my girlfriend of 10 years died today, what are things to help me cope?	First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. My only input here beyond all of the super helpful things that people have said is to make sure you keep the three essentials going - Diet/Sleep/Exercise. Everything in life is easier to deal with when you have the DSE on lock.	thank you all for your words, i've been up all night im just going to try to stay strong even though it hurts so bad i WISH SO BAD that i had just picked her up from work
What do i do if my date is a communist, i'm a right-wing kind of person?	Write her off as a potential partner, go into fuck it mode and have fun with the date. Be goofy and silly because it won't matter. Then at the end of the date tell her you aren't interested and find someone else. Source: A Libertarian that has had this happen a few times.	You go on the date, and then depending on if that date goes well you either: a) go on another date b) dont
Mothers of Reddit: How do you prevent yourself from losing your personal identity while being a mom?	What identity? I have no idea who I would be if I wasn't a mom at this point. I really don't know how to deal with moving past my child bearing years because I've had little ones to care for for so long.	I'm not a mom, but you might appreciate [this video](https://www.google.com/amp/en.rocketnews24.com/2014/10/08/japanese-mothers-react-to-being-called-by-their-first-names-after-years-of-just-being-mama/amp/?client=ms-android-sprint-us). It explores what happens when men start calling their wives by their first name instead of just calling them 'wife' or 'mom'. So, I guess my answer to your question is that your partner should treat you like you have a separate identity from them and the kids. Which you do, but it's easy to lose sight of that when you get used to bring called 'Joey's mom' or 'Jeff's wife'.
Men, how obvious is it when a woman is sexually attracted to you?	Extremely. Women can't hide arousal to save their lives. I don't understand the whole Reddit trope of "I don't see it". Women are painfully obvious when they're aroused, I just feel a lot of guys don't always like to take the shot unless they're 110% sure.	>I’m talking about unplanned (or even unwanted) yet palpable sexual tension. The kind where you can’t think about anything except ripping their clothes off and doing it where you stand. >Is it more or less noticeable when it’s a reciprocal tension? It is noticeable. However, I notice it about 2-5 years after the incident in question.
what common relationship advice irritates you the most ?	When I first found out about a thing called "love languages". It seems like a parody that people seem to take very seriously.	"Just talk it out." Well yea, but can I be left the fuck alone for a bit though because talking it out right now when my anger level is 10 probably isn't productive so leeeeeeeave me alone we don't need to talk immediately.
How do I confront my roommate about his girlfriend being over too much?	Wait, I'm a little bit confused. Is she an economic drain on you/the household? Like is she monopolizing the living room couch, eating all of the food or anything else but hanging out in your roommates space? Because if it's just a matter of you not liking her there, this is a situation I'd advise to "suck it up." I get that it's frustrating that your roommate isn't listening to you, but (and maybe I just suck at reading) it almost sounds like jealousy on your part.	I had a friend who went through almost this exact scenario. Except it was her, two male room-mates, and one of their girlfriends. And when she complained that the girlfriend was there all the time and not contributing to the rent or anything they got really petty and started being dicks to her. She ended up going to the landlord, because the place was in her name, and basically demanding he do something about it. She basically was saying "this is violating my lease agreement" (they usually have rules about how often guests can stay), and that they could either stop the girlfriend from being there so often, or let her out of her lease agreement. It isn't the best solution, but if you a roommate who isn't showing you any respect, sometimes being hostile is the way to go.
How long did you have to hide "every disgusting thing" with your SO before you were comfortable to let it all loose?	I have never tried to hide it. I think I farted early on. I mean, I was classy about it but I think it's crazy to always try to be that perfect doll that doesnt poop and pee, he should accept you at a whole.	About four years into my marriage my husband and I were getting drunk on the porch arguing about gender and shit because he loves to bait me into arguments I’m passionate about. We pop into the kitchen to refill our glasses and I’m already feeling unequipped to discuss the issue further. He makes a scathing point at the sink and I look him dead in the eye and let loose a loud ass fart. Deadpan I tell him to rebut that and that’s the first time I ever farted in front of him.
Do you guys think the fadeaway/ghosting is a valid way to end a casual relationship?	Might I point out that the truth in breaking up usually doesn't go over very well with women. Among those truths are: * You got too fat (not to fuck, but to be in a long relationship with) * You're too boring (idem) * I don't respect you enough (idem) * I've outgrown you, and can do better than you now * You're only feminist when it's in your favor Imagine, if you will, that every guy who just faded away cared enough about you not to tell you these things in your face. Similar argument holds if sexes are reversed, obviously.	Of course not. It's a cowardly way to end things. Have the balls to end it face to face like an adult. Give your reasons. Say thanks and goodbye. UNLESS they treated you bad. Then you don't owe 'em anything. Source: The 'fade away' thing was done to me. It sucks.
Women of Reddit, what are things guys think you care about but actually don't?	Mod Note: Yes, every single opinion in this thread could be countered with "But I know (am) a woman/women who does (do) care about this one particular item which you do not care about" The point of this thread though is to ask what people answering the question *don't* care about. Women don't share a brain. Different people are going to have different things that matters to them. Any comments trying to act as Captain Obvious in this manner will be removed.

Inexperience is killing my dating life. How can show the girl I am a sexual being?	Have you ever tried ecstasy? It can give you insight into your anxiety and provide tools to use in the future for interacting with people.	>I messaged over 150 girls and out of those, about 15 responded, and out of those only 4 have expressed interest in going on a date. In my experience and from what I've heard from other guys on OkC, that's about how the online dating experience is for a lot of guys. So don't dwell on that. You're at least getting dates, which is more than a lot of guys can boast. Are you trying to get a relationship or just get laid? Because you seem to be speaking in two minds here. If you want to build a relationship, there's nothing wrong with a coffee and chat date. The whole point is to suss out if you two have personal chemistry.
My girlfriend died. How did you deal with this?	Take a year to mourn your dead, then see if you can move forward. Life is hard enough going it alone.	Jesus, mate. I haven't had anything like that happen to me but like with any tragedy it's going to take a long time for it to stop hurting. You're never going to forget her but you have to move on. Maybe not today, tomorrow, this year. But you have your own life to live. I know that if I died I'd want my girlfriend to live her life to the fullest and I'm sure your girlfriend would want that for you.
WOC, if you are white-passing, how do you feel about that?	I'm from ex Yugoslavia and have dark hair and dark eyes. I live in Norway where most people are blond haired and blue eyed. I don't pass as a norwegian and people often ask me about my heritage, because I look very much East european.	I always found the College Humour"Are you Asian Enough" video to be spot on in how exhausting it can be to exist in the space that isn't "enough" of either. In Canada I'm the normal girl until someone finds out about my ancestry (then I'm Asian chick even though I don't look any different), in Japan I'm that white girl who isn't Japanese enough.
Men who are honest/have little to no filter in real life, how often does it get you into conflict?	Constantly. I'm brutally honest and crass. And I can't just let things go. I almost always have to give my two cents on things. Even if I figure out I'm wrong, I keep going. I'm trying to get better about it, but it's a struggle.	I used to be like this, but a comment I read on reddit a few years ago changed me completely. It said something akin to "You aren't honest if you only say what you're thinking when it's negative. If you think someone looks good, or is doing well, but keep your mouth shut, but you'll comment if they look bad or do something poorly, you're just an asshole".
Men who have driven fire trucks, how cool was that?	I drive one in the city, it's about as cool as you would think it is. By the way guys, unless you want to look like a huge puss, don't be the grown man with his fingers in his ears when a fire truck goes by. Edit: I should add, I use to drive a really huge truck, [now I drive the fire SUV.](https://youtu.be/kSiwoKCiy-s)	I drive one all the time. It depends on the truck. Our engine has an Allison automatic in it. It goes ok. Our tanker has 8LL in it. It's fuckin fun, lights going, slamming gears, lanyard style air horns with chromed bells. Most guys can run the automatic, but not many can slam gears, run the siren, air horns and radio while smiling. I grin every time I start it.
What podcasts do you listen to and what do you gain from them?	I really enjoy Guys we Fucked. It may not seem like it from the title but its taught me so much about myself, my sexuality, and life in general. They have some pretty great guests on there too and aren't afraid to talk about real and controversial topics on top of the more raunchy episodes.	*This American Life* is like walking through a portrait museum of people who are both ordinary and captivating. They put an incredible amount of intention into transforming obscure people and events into short stories. I feel like I get to meet all these incredible humans in my living room.
Dads, what are pros and cons of having children in your 30s?	I am a 36 year old man with no kids and I have no idea why anyone would want them. Your wife pulled a bait and switch on you. That's not cool.	Pro: you're possibly in a more stable posituon than you were in your 20s. Con: They arent grown til you're in your 50s.
Men who gave a brojob: what is your lifestory?	Never had any experience with a dude, but on my bucket list, I really wanna fuck a tranny that passes off for a woman. Or a trap that looks like a cute girl. Hell I already jerk off to that kinda porn when I get bored with Pornhub or there aren't enough good feet fetish videos to cum to. I head on over to Shemaletube and go to town. Something about fucking a tranny is so scary and thrilling and hot.	Never gave, but let a gay dude suck on it because I was desperate. He also bought me pancakes first. Met at karaoke
You say something stupid to your SO, and she hits you. Your response?	My wife of 38 years weighs 101 lbs. I weigh 240. My wife worked in an office. I've been everything from a farm hand to longshoreman, to armed guard, to firearms instructor, to self defense instructor. Yes, she has struck me, and I deserved it. I laughed.	I am fascinated by these responses. I grew up with all types of media (movies, comics) depicting men being jerks, and the girl slapping them and walking away sassy, while the guy stood there and held his face, either in shock, or smirking because he succeeded in irritating the girl. This made it seem completely acceptable/normal. It wasn't considered abuse or assault because those things were only recognizable by black eyes, bruises, and the like. I think it is pretty awesome the guys are standing their ground. "if you love me/care about me, there is absolutely no reason to react in that way".
How do I let my former male coworker know I didn't mean to reject his advances completely?	How drunk was he? Might be something to watch with him. Not saying either way, but that's pretty forward when you were drunk.	Here's an idea. If you want to be with him, just let him know you are interested and move forward. If you don't want to be with him, leave it alone. Honesty and directness, go figure.
How do you deal with your gf spending a lot of time with another guy?	Drop her. You always want to keep the women in your life around on your terms. You're clearly not happy with this so end it.	Alot of guys are saying to find a girl to hang out with. This will just cause more issues and am eventual break up. Might as well just break up with her in the first place and avoid stupid drama. You can't do much except work on your relationship if you want to keep her. She will do what she will do. Either you have trust in her and work on this with your relationship or move on and break up.
If you could force all men experience one aspect of being a woman, what experience would you give them?	This thread has now been locked as despite the [excellent reminder message posted by Daenyx earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/8d1ujk/if_you_could_force_all_men_experience_one_aspect/dxk5b0k/), some people found it too difficult to stay respectfully on topic.

Straight guys, what's the most homosexual exp. you had and did you regret it?	Gay guy bought me a drink at a bar and tried to get into my pants. I declined politely, explaining I was into girls.	One of the supervisors at my company tried to have sex with me. We got as far as my bedroom before I realized what was going on. He, some co-workers, and I had had all been at a bar. I was pretty drunk and I thought he wanted a place to sober up before driving. Call it naivety, but I had no idea he was trying to make a play on me as we were discussing my potential romantic interest at the time (who is indeed a woman). I had to explain my heterosexual alignment and felt terrible that it had even gotten to that point.
What do you do when you’re by yourself that would make you look like a crazy person if someone saw?	I talk to myself like I am 2 people talking to each other arguing different sides of a problem. Basically like real life playing chess against yourself. I use we a lot for just me, I use us and our a lot. I have a big family and had a lot of friends in school but in large groups I feel alone because I talk above most people when I am not drunk. I get drunk to dumb myself down to average American social levels. I was teaching adults computers for money at age 11. I am a great public speaker and not shy at all. I feel awkward when others joke about something I talk about because they feel awkward knowing nothing on the subject.	When I daydream I get absurdly into it, So you could catch me talking to myself/emotionally reacting I also pace while I do it lmao So a crazy, pacing person talking to themselves and maybe even crying or laughing it's a movie in my head basically e: I'm honestly shook how many other people here do this lol thanks for responding ladies. I feel a lot less crazy 😁
What sort of "modern luxuries" under $200 do you have that make your lives so much more comfortable/easier?	The Apple Airport Time Capsule. Makes for insanely fast Internet, a good external hard drive, and is more aesthetically pleasing than your average wireless router.	Since I just got this out for winter, I have a small space heater and an outlet timer, and I have the space heater set to turn on about 15 minutes before my morning alarm to warm the room up a little for me.
Why does it seem like social anxiety is so common these days?	I venture to say most comments are completely self diagnosed. It's the victim complex. They want something to blame for themselves. I refuse to believe every other redditor is someone who suffers from depression, social anxiety, has a slight case of OCD, while being an introvert, has a narcissist parent, and also suffers from misophonia.	I'd say its a combination of: * exposure to social media creates warped views on what a "fulfilled" life is * the internet gives shy people a place to vent safely * social anxiety related issues are topical and possibly being over-diagnosed * modern society has shed a lot of culture/tradition that provided regularity and purpose; it it's absence a lot of people are feeling lost and without purpose
What instrument(s) do you play or want to learn to play? Are you any good?	Cello, bass guitar, and some piano. I'm trying to get my friend to teach me electric guitar. Also I can play a wicked kazoo.	I play the saxophone (hello ladies) and the clarinet (hello classy ladies) as my two main instruments, I play the saxophone in a wind band and the clarinet in a jazz band. I also play the piano, the accordion and some guitar. I want to learn the guitar better, but I'd need a new guitar and that's expensive.
What actually impresses you in a girl compared to what girls think impresses you?	I'm not impressed by clothes, makeup and hair. Infact, I'm offput by someone who would spend any significant amount of time or money on any of them. I'm actually impressed with intelligence, openness, honestly, groundedness and a sense of humour.	Having and maintaining hobbies when they're in a relationship. I've seen girls say they read, hike, and do other stuff suddenly stop when they're seeing someone so they can spend all their time with the person.
Fathers of Reddit, what can your daughter's boyfriend do to make a good first impression?	nothing. you want to fuck his daughter and he knows it. If anything, be respectful and ALWAYS follow his rules. if he says he wants her home by 11, make sure she's home by 1050. no excuses ever. Whatever he says, goes. He is the guy who is letting his daughter see you, don't give him any reason to regret it.	Walk up and shake his hand. Introduce yourself. In my experience, the "what are your intentions" talks rarely happen. Just be friendly and polite when you meet the family. Ask about their interests, they'll ask about yours. Just be respectful to everyone and you wont have a problem
What are subtle signs that someone isn't a good partner?	Anybody can be partners with anyone else. Partners aren't just bad in the sense that a tomato is bad past it's expiration date. There are layers to people and this is really just an incredibly immoral question at worst, and ignorant at best. Diverse people means diverse needs in a relationship. There's also the evolution of a relationship where people grow from the needs of each other. Don't just blanket this under the sense of a "normal guy". No one is normal and we are all flawed in one way or another. I'm sorry to rant but the point of view that this question even comes from is intolerance.	Always feeling like you have to apologize for them and their behavior at social events. Happened a lot with one of my exes, I feel like I had a mental block about it.
Do you support a friend who has done something wrong, like cheated on her SO?	I have and I'm glad. She fucked up (a lot) but we're best friends and I know she didn't do it to intentionally hurt him. I know that she feels a lot of remorse and was going through a lot of shit with not a lot of support. It doesn't excuse what she did, but I understand how it all happened and I'd hate to not have her in my life. Years later she was cheated on, but they worked it out. And now everyone is happy. That sounds naive and silly and I'm sure some people will be mad at this response, and I get it. I feel a bit bad about it too. But people do bad shit but it doesn't mean they're all bad.	My best friend was cheating on her husband, he found out, they stayed together. Whether she still is or not, I have no idea. I asked her to stop telling me about it because I can't lie if I don't really know. The only thing that REALLY pissed me off was she used me as an alibi a few times. Do whatever you want but don't drag me in to it.
My (24F) boyfriend (29M) is going out of town for a week and has asked me to house sit. What can I do around the house as a nice surprise for when he gets back?	Unpopular opinion: Don't fuck with his shit. Don't change things. Don't make things "better". It's his home. You have no license or agency to improve, change or othewise alter his home whatsoever. Do not organize, change, move or clean anything whatsoever.	Replace two pictures with the sloth astronaut. https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/011/732/Screen_shot_2012-11-16_at_2.20.55_PM.png Write on the back of them "that's one!" and "that's three!" Edit: guys, I know we all love shitposting, but this is ridiculous
Ladies of Reddit, what are some not often talked about problems of pregnancy? We all know about getting sick, hormonal, and getting cravings, but what else have you experienced?	"Lightning crotch" Presumably caused by the baby pressing on certain nerves toward the end of pregnancy, this a sudden stabbing pain in the vagina that can bring you to your knees. Had no idea this was a thing until I experienced it.	Food aversions. Everyone talks about food cravings like it’s a cute joke, but food aversions are more common. Imagine food suddenly smelling like trash or vomit, coupled with a very sensitive sense of smell so you can smell other people’s food a mile off. I couldn’t stand the smell of cooking oil, made the sickness so much worse.
How do I tell this to my husband without making him feel bad?	Sell or pawn the ring. Tell him you won a scratch off lottery ticket. Suggest you take the "winnings" to buy rings.	I'm not exactly sure how you can bring it up, but I would suggest that you make sure to reiterate very clearly that it's just a ring and its source has no bearing on your love for him.
What have you accidentally trained your pet to do?	We had a golden retriever called Lily. Lily used to do the most horrendous trumps, like eye wateringly bad. Us 3, as lazy teenagers used to shout "stink!" and send her out of the room. It got to the point that we could just shout "stink!" And the dog would leave whatever room the family was in, whether she'd trumped or not.	I warned my roommate not to train my parrot to do things for pistachios. I warned him...she doesn't do tricks. She's too smart. She will follow you around and continue to the things you "teach" until you're insane. I warned him. Play with her. Make games. Do not do tricks for treats. Well. He didn't listen. He taught her to flip the light switch for pistachios. Every room she's in now can become a techno rave of blinking lights and her making dripping noises. She's doing it right now. WHAT DID WE LEARN, SHAYNE?! WHAT THE FUCK DID WE LEARN?! Edit: OP delivery! https://www.facebook.com/becky.mitsui/videos/10103704383717738/
What are your favorite punk rock albums?	Acrobatic Tenement by At the Drive-in For the whole world to see by the classic Detroit band "Death" (not the metal band) Foo fighters first album. (Self titled) White trash two heebs and a bean by Nofx Black Monk Time by The Monks. Cheshire Cat by Blink 182	Misfits - Collection Wire - Pink Flag Black Flag - Damaged Minutemen - Double Nickels on the Dime Fugazi - 13 Songs Patti Smith - Horses
What is the worst advice you ever received from your parents?	When I was younger my mom said that you shouldn't marry someone until you have experienced every season with them. I thought it was poetic at the time but I now realize she was basically saying to marry someone after only knowing them for a year! Hell no!	My parents seem to be under the impression that the job market is exactly the same as it was when they were first starting out in the late 70s/early 80s. Also my dad yelled at me for not PHYSICALLY going to companies to give them my resume (like I'm a door to door salesman). That's not how this shit works anymore and he doesn't get it.
Men, how do you feel about receiving racy pics from women you don't know well?	I'd prolly be pretty suspicious or figure it was a mistake. As for dudes sending unsolicited dick pics, I figure it's a high risk high reward type thing.	You would be hard pressed to convince me to send a dick pic. I like to think most guys wouldn't do it unless pressured. But, then there are douches like that that probably think it turns you on enough to give him a chance. I dunno what the thought process is when sending an unsolicited dick pic....
What are your uncommon dealbreakers in relationships?	If their parents are divorced. I know, I know, it isn't entirely fair, but I know enough to know that I don't have it in me to deal with the baggage that inevitably comes along with the children of even the most amicable of divorces.	His social media presence. If they overshare or just kind of embarrassing/cringey online in general, that's a dealbreaker to me.
How much are we really fooling you with our makeup/figure flattering clothes/push up bras etc?	Some people look way different without makeup. A little bit to enhance the facial features, eyelashes, eyes, etc is fine. But if you're a whole new person with makeup, that's false advertising. Push-up bras are straight up false advertising. No way around that one. Hiding a not flat stomach isn't false advertising, that's just showing off your better features while not necessarily showing your not-so-great features.	Most people tend to be more critical of their own imperfections than anyone else is, and as a result they try to hide them in the early part of a relationship. But if you get to the point that you feel enough of a connection to this person and you're willing to show them your imperfections, it's very likely that they're not going to mind them.
What made your day today?	It’s only 7:55 am but this morning I got baby girl ready for school while husband gets ready for work. He had some morning farts so he let it rip and my little one was falling over laughing with her entire body. Her laugh is so contagious. When you hear her laugh, you can’t help but to laugh as well. Love mornings with my fam	I went to the second hand clothes shop because class was cancelled and I bought the biggest fluffiest jumper in the history of big fluffy jumpers and then spent the rest of the day wandering about uni like a smug oversized marshmallow thinking about how big and fluffy it was. I'm wearing it as I type this comment too and smiling because of how big and fluffy it is.
I just had the worst sex of my life. What was yours?	plenty of times. it's when the guy is so selfish that he doesn't care if the girl is enjoying and never asks. the worst part is when he doesn't ask because he thinks he's doing great.	My first time was break-up sex. Pro tip - never lose your virginity with break up sex. There was a lot of sadness and crying and bad decisions, 2/10 wouldn't recommend.
What’s your best ethically gray life hack?	When buying an avocado ring it up as a navel orange at self checkout Still paying for an item...just cheaper item	I learned this while working with kids, but it's remarkably effective with adults as well (morally grey because it can be manipulative depending on situation): In a situation where you're depending on someone to make a decision, give them two choices (both of which are beneficial for you). Most of the time people will just pick one of the choices instead of presenting an alternative that might be less desirable for me. So if I want my partner to do a chore I'm avoiding, I might say "would you rather scoop the litterbox or empty the wastebaskets?" Chances are he'll just pick one of those two instead of suggesting a different chore he'd rather do, whereas if I asked "which chores are you going to do?" he probably would suggest a chore I'd rather do myself.
Former adult industry workers, what were some of the unexpected challenges/surprises you experienced when returning to the "normal" workforce?	Does stripping count? The great thing about stripping was the cash and attention...but I realized this was not for me; you can't keep stripping forever. Keeping a regular 8-5 is much more rewarding due to having health and dental benefits with a full-time job. :-)	I have worked for porn stores and they are very different from other retail places in the amount of power/trust placed in employees. Someone making you uncomfortable? Kick then out. Someone say they are pro-Bush and they are being a jerk (this was 2004)? Give them a flyer on how Bush is anti-porn and kick them out. Someone call you a bitch or make a move on you? Kick them out. No manager involvement. No asking permission. If someone bothered me, I told them to leave. Management would tell them to fuck off and never come back if they complained about it or demanded management.
Did you have a friend when you were younger, who at the time didn't seem like a bad friend, but when you look back, they really were kind of shitty?	My (supposed) best friend in high school. Got me into some really shady shit and fucked up my life for a while. Nearly tried meth because of her.	I thought because she was my childhood best friend since birth I owed her my friendship. One day it dawned on me how shitty of a person she was to me and I stood up for myself and "broke up" with her.
Women who (may be) mentally ill and in relationships, how do you avoid going overboard when asking for reassurance?	I like to think that the person who chooses to live their life with you has accepted you for everything, even if you need excessive reassurance that everything will be alright. (There is of course a line, where strategy, therapy, and medical treatment must come into play because your partner can't be your doctor.) Mental health is an all day thing. Anxiety will come in many forms, and so does my ADHD and depressive moments. SO has his difficulties too. We just try our best to love and understand each other.	I refer to the need for reassurance as “anxiety brain.” I’m in a long distance relationship so these obsessive thoughts happen a lot. Instead of saying “you’re not going to dump me because of the distance, right?” I say: “Anxiety brain is telling me that you’ll dump me because of the distance.” We even refer to “anxiety brain” as a person. He’s an asshole It’s not my fault that I have ptsd and anxiety. So I’m going to blame that fucker for those dumb thoughts. It also helps that my boyfriend is amazing and considerate. When I say I’m worried about something, he immediately wants me to tell him the thoughts so he can shut them up. He reminds me that it’s not my fault and does everything in his power to help me ignore the obsession. Edit: added what exactly my boyfriend says.
Women of reddit, what is your worst beauty induced injury?	I was trimming my pubes with a pair of scissors and accidentally cut my labia. That hurt like SON-OF-A-[non-AW word].	I've got arthritis in both feet at a pretty young age thanks to wearing cute shoes that were wrong for me, if that counts.
I'm getting a vasectomy in 5 hours. I'm really nervous. Any tips on how to make things go smoothly?

If you're curious about this, please message the mods. If you want to tell me how cool I am, message me.

Do people actually go up to complete strangers at the coffee shop or in the grocery checkout line, have some witty banter and then go out to dinner? Or have I just been watching too much Seinfeld?	>>> Maybe I'm in the wrong city no, you're in the wrong mental universe. Do you think Seinfeld pulled an actress by sitting at home watching television, or twitter'ing?	It does, but probably not very often, maybe even less so now with all these dating apps/sites. I met one of my ex's at my University bus stops, I was feeling good that day and complimented her band shirt. We talked for the whole 10 minute bus ride and I asked for her number when we got off, and we went on a movie-style first date for coffee from there.
Guys, I'm moving into my first apartment right now. What are the secret essentials?	Plunger (obvious) Slow cooker (google any recipe and be a master) Couch (won't get pussy without it) Guest bong (cuz you're a good guy)	If you want to play it safe, take pictures of everything before you move in furniture. On moving out, if the landlord tries to charge you for damage you didn't cause you can use this to defend yourself financially.
What is a cause that you feel passionately about and why?	Restoring freedom to America. If I'm not hurting anyone or stealing from anyone, leave me the fuck alone. Go get gay married while your friends have a 21 gun salute with their machine guns and then you smoke all the herbs and Cuban cigars you can find and eat fresh killed venison and caught trout. I.Don't.Care. Personally, I'm getting more active in the Libertarian party. While I don't agree with some of their ideals (I'd rather pay some taxes and have police/fire and roads, but I think way too much in taxes are taken and it's all completely wasted by the government. Also, we need protection in place for children to thrive), they are the ones looking to strike laws down, not add more laws. Each additional law added is limiting your freedom, not giving you more.	I feel very passionate about changing the perception of the general population on people with mental illness. I have experienced intense and crushing depression. I wrote my masters thesis on how books and stories of people with mental illness can lessen the stigma that society imposes on people with mental illnesses. The stigma people with anxiety and depression suffer from is so severe and acts as one of the largest barriers to care because people are so fearful of how others will view them. People still think it is about bucking up and getting over it. Or they think people with a mental illness are harmful/destructive. We are all people. And we all deserve empathy and understanding.

What made the worst party you’ve been to so bad?	It was last year's Halloween. It was just soooo boring. My husband's friend's wife planned it and invited a bunch of mis-matched personalities over. She decorated and made appetizers, but that's all she did for "fun". Because everyone was different, and 100% introverted, nobody wanted to talk. The host didn't have any entertainment for us - games, movies, music, etc. It was just a bunch of people huddled in different corners watching youtube on their phone. When I finally approached someone to talk to them, they just told me about how they didn't invite their girlfriend because she's so boring.	I was invited to a classmate's bachelorette party. It turned out to be a Mary Kay "party" where we sat around listening to a woman try to sell us products. At least there was wine(EDIT: I should clarify, it was my wine, that I brought, because it was BYOB.)
When is the last time you broke down and really cried?	On the 22nd of may 2017 I attended the Ariana Grande Concert in Manchester, a terror attack occurred at the end of the concert leaving over 100 injured and 22 dead. I'm not going into detail since I'm still recovering mentally but let's just say that no 16 year old should have to see such violence at a teens concert. I got home at 5am that night and cried myself to sleep, was in shell shock for a week and didn't sleep or eat a thing. Got counselling and I am finally coming to terms that I need to live my life since I'm so fortunate to get out that arena alive.	Girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer. It is highly survivable so I wasn't really overly concerned (optimist), but she was scared one night and I was holding her and it just got to me. Probably a good 15 seconds of crying. Can't remember the time before that.
Is your wife taking your last name important to you?	Yes. The entire institution of marriage is based on the tradition of formalizing your relationship. If a woman would not take my name, I would not marry her - simple as that.	Well she took her ex's last name when they were married, so I'd be a little perplexed if she wouldn't take mine.
I was once offered a free ticket to a concert, which I never made it to since I slipped on ice, broke my front tooth and had an ambulance escort me to the hospital where I received a public intoxication and an underage drinking citation. What would you consider your finest moment?	Nothing nearly so dramatic/bad, but going insane on the Yogg-Saron (an endgame boss in World of Warcraft) fight after I'd been repeatedly reminding my raid group (which I was leading) to keep an eye on their sanity meters. Got teased about that one for literally years afterward.	I was drunk in a bar in Korea. Went out to use the bathroom and slipped on vomit. My drunk mind decided it needed to miss the vomit and I proceeded to land full force on my elbow. I shattered it. Good news is that I didn't land in the vomit.
Men who love their jobs, what do you do?	I don't love my job, and many people don't; I don't think you need to "love" your job in order to be happy, though it's definitely ideal. You sure won't get any better sense of what you want to do by asking strangers on the internet. Are you thinking about a career change? If so, find a field that interests you and try to run with it. Either way, if your current situation isn't working out, take the necessary steps. Or move to another city, whatever. Sorry I might be a bit drunk but you get my point.	I take care of people with disabilities. Love it. The people i watch over really enjoy having me around since we are all around the same age (21). Most aren't verbal but we still have conversations. Even one of the guys who is very aggressive toeards staff hasnt tried to hit me yet. I dont even say i work. I just hang out with friends and get paid for it.
If your wife was going away for the weekend, and you had the house to yourself for three days what would you do?	Nothing different, because my live-in-girlfriend doesn't control my fucking life. If your girlfriend or wife DOES control your life, you need to get your fucking balls back and remind her that relationships are two-way, not all about her.	Play video games and eat rubbish for 2 days. Then regret not tidying up after myself so on the final day panic tidy the house.
Have you used Bumble BFF to make new friends? What was your experience?	Absolutely not. Too many women who were not interesting even slightly. Every other profile mentioned their reliance on coffee and incapability of surviving without wine or netflix. Not the type of people i'm looking for. I have however had a lot of success in making girlfriends on Tinder! Way better, women there who have that they're looking for other women ticked (whether it's romantically or platonically) tend to have more edge and have been more interesting in my opinion. I've met almost all of my best girlfriends in the new city I live in on there.	Yes!! I actually have, and I met up with a couple of cool ladies. I made some casual friends and then I made one really good friend who I immediately clicked with. It's a little awkward at first, but I found most people were easy to talk to!
(Serious) Is anyone else deathly afraid of giving birth and why?	Do I need a reason for being terrified of germinating a body-wrecking* parasite for nine months and then having it completely destroy what's left of my reproductive organs on its way out? *By "body-wrecking", I'm not just talking about pregnant boobs and stretch marks. Rotating your heart 45 degrees? Compressed lungs? Compressed bladder? Swollen feet, swollen ankles, hemorrhoids, gingivitis, the potential loss of teeth, blood pressure complications, morning sickness that may or may not go away, heartburn that no antacid will touch, cravings for all the things, the potential for detached abdominal muscles, potentially destroyed pelvic floor (which can mean incontinence if you're lucky), unpredictable mood swings..... And at the end of it, you're responsible for another human for the rest of your life. Hahahahah no.	Yes, because it can kill you or leave you with horrific injuries (fourth degree tears, fistula, pelvic prolapse). I deal with this fear by making sure it never happens to me.
What's the pettiest way you've gotten back at a roommate?	The guy has kids over 10 and in no way can any other neighbor hear our music. When the guy threatens to kick your ass, on multiple occasions clearly he's not thinking straight. One day he was pulling out of our shared driveway, saw we were getting home and stops his car. He gets out barges in our home and threatens us, while leaving his wife and kids in the car. What kind of man does that? Sure it's not fair to his kids but this is just one of our more passive ways to get back at this douche.	I have a roommate who never cleans... ever. He has a body wash that stains the bathtub with a gross residue so sometimes when I see a puddle of it when I'm taking a shower I'll take his bath scrubber loofa thing and clean the bathtub with it using my foot as I'm standing there showering.
Do you think there are any ways in which society has gone backward, and not forward, in being understanding and progressive?	Soooo many things to do with babies. From the right way to carry them in the backpack things for them to sit right and how cosleeping is horribly wrong. People have been carrying babies and cosleeping for soooo long why is it suddenly so horrible?	I feel like a few years ago nobody cared about trans people using the "correct" bathroom. Now it's a huge debate.
What is something you and your SO do that might be considered unique?	My hubby and I say “I lima bean you” because I made a ceramic bowl in a heart shape and he asked if it was a lima bean. I even bought him a lima bean with a cute face on it for his bday one year, and painted him a thing that said “I (a picture of two lima beans hugging) you” for Xmas.	My husband reads me bedtime stories sometimes. I tend to stay up till 2am or so when left to my own devices but the reading time heps settle me down a bit. Also he does voices and it's amazing. Right now we're working our way through some of the Discworld books. He's on a work trip right now and still calls each night to read to me, and it's the best.
Which aspects of dating culture do you think needs to permanently retire and why?	Defending racial preferences and blatantly discriminating against others because of said preferences. I was also guilty of this at one point.	I really hate the idea of having to act like you’re less interested in someone than you actually are in the beginning stages out of fear of them losing interest in you. I want attention it’s not fair lol
Men in your 20s, what are your biggest frustrations with women who are the same age as you?	My biggest struggle by far is finding a woman interested in shooting/firearms. It is a deal breaker for me. They don’t have to like guns necessarily, but if their on the ban train or “don’t have those in ‘our’ house” thing. I’m out. They are a very large part of my life. I shoot as a hobby, I shoot competitively, and selling guns is a part of my livelihood.	Being in my early 20s, you could be dealing with a grown woman. You could be dealing with a total child. And it’s not always easy to gauge how they fall on that spectrum immediately.
What gross thing has happened to you recently?	At KFC with a colleague and while talking with her mouth full she spits out some greasy fried chicken skin onto my white shirt. Couldn't rid the stain by the time I went out with friends that evening, however I think the bar lighting saved me.	A bird shit on my leg while I was walking around yesterday. Since it had rained recently, I thought it was rain, so I tried to use my other leg to wipe it off. Instead I got bird shit on both my legs.
Do you think lottery winners should be allowed to remain anonymous?	The problem is that if the winners are anonymous there will claims that the lottery didn't pay out or that they just split the money between themselves or something. And no one could check it because the real winner needs to stay hidden.	Anonymity is the norm here in Australia, following the case of Graham Thorne in 1960. This sad story is a well known part of Australian history. The government ran a lottery to raise funds during the construction of the Sydney Opera House, and this lottery gathered a lot of public popularity. It was won by a man named Bazil Thorne. Soon after, his 8 year old son Graham was kidnapped and held for ransom. He was later murdered, and the investigation that followed is a bit off topic, but is interesting in its own right. You can read more on this story [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Thorne_kidnapping)
I've eaten Chipotle 5 out of the last 7 days. What objectively embarrassing accomplishment are you proud of right now?	I've been eating totally natural/fresh foods for almost a month, and then I ate Chinese food and got sick. I kind of see this as an accomplishment because my cravings for fast food/heavily processed food are pretty much gone at this point. I actually crave healthy/fresh foods now instead of just forcing myself to eat them because I should.	I figured out if you pour PBR into a ginger ale bottle, it looks just like ginger ale. It makes day drinking in public a breeze. College student.
Does anyone not have kids but still find themselves making decisions for future kids that may or may not even come into existence??	I don't. I'm about 30 now and I'm glad I have never done this because I don't want to make decisions and plan my life around nonexistent kids	Yeah. I'm spending some time watching my roommates two kids at the moment and in my head I am SUCH a backseat parent. I have kept all my opinions to myself but WOW, I had no idea I had this many opinions about childcare. So now it's sort of bleeding into other stuff, like I wanna travel loads so I'm thinking about international schools or boarding schools blah blah. Maybe I have caught the baby bug. Maybe someone needs to inform my SO.
What has been one of the most uncomfortable social situations you have been in?	when I have to ask a male Prof or TA a question and start blushing. I can't help it, men make me blush.	Nearing the end of my senior year of college, I once found myself at a rooftop party with my then-boyfriend and, somehow, every guy I'd ever been involved with in my four years there. Thankfully I was drunk enough to not feel tooooo much discomfort. (Edit: there were other people there, of course)
In your experience, what happens immediately after you say "no" to sex with a partner?	As a guy when I get rejected I don't take it personally and have learnt to be patient and understanding.	He goes, "Ok, no problem," and then we cuddle and watch Frasier, typically. The exact same situation occurs when he says no too. We're both pretty understanding of that stuff as we both work 60 hour weeks (totally different hours though) so it can be hard to coordinate that when one or both of us is exhausted or has to get up at 6am the next day.
Men of AskWomen, what brings you to this sub and what is the most interesting thing you learned about women?	It's a great way to find out what women like/dislike, and to dispel common stereotypes. One thing that's not so great about being male on this sub is dissenting opinions from men are often deleted by the mods, which never happens on /r/AskMen	Why I'm here: I'm pretty shy irl, so this sub has given me some healthy perspectives on women and answered some questions I'm not able to get elsewhere. What I've learned: Think before I say something/offer an opinion where it's not warranted, it's not always my fault if she pulls away and chasing won't help
What are your thoughts on hanging out with exes or former sexual partners while in a relationship?	People who are opposed to this don't hang out with their own exes and honestly that probably means that their exes were never friends—only lovers—and that their current lovers also are not their friends. "Oh hey love chemicals dried up; I guess that means you have nothing to offer me any more as a person if I can't get that drug high from you any more kthxbye". It's in general symptomatic of a way of interacting I don't want with anyone including my lovers and it tends to also come coupled with "all my friends are of sex A and all my lovers of sex B"	I trust my partner but it would still make me uncomfortable. If he asked to go hang out with his ex, I wouldn’t say no but I’d still say I’d prefer he didn’t.
Were you ever unknowingly the "other woman"??	I was knowingly the other woman and fuck man... I get a lot of flack for it but people just dont understand the emotional turmoil being the other woman can be too...you fall for someone and it's always "I'm gonna break up with her" "I don't love her you are my only love" and constant heartbreak after heartbreak. I feel total guilt for the pain I probably caused but she was in another country and to me, SHE was the other woman!	Yup, a guy I had a strictly physical relationship with. First he was going through a complicated divorce. Then it came out that he lived in a spare bedroom in the basement. Uh huh. Found his wife's blog - she thought they were happy.
Women who have completed a cross country road trip (or a long drive of any sort), what is your advice for a road trip newbie?	I need to ask the OP this: what has gender got to do with being able to drive a long distance? How different could you possibly believe it is for men and women to drive across a country or state? Gender has nothing to do with driving. If you want to pass the time, then do what ever you would normally do. Music, books on tape, podcasts, silence, or whatever.	Portable jump starter like this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZB8T6N/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 The usb ports have kept my phone/camera charged when my cigarette lighter 12v socket randomly died. It's jumped my jeep multiple times when i left my lights on. It's jumped other people's cars too which is nice to not have to hook up my vehicle and possible jack it up. And the air compressor was nice for my bicycle. Just overall very useful. Other than that I recommend a nice mount for your phone. Trying to use it as a GPS/music while its in my cup holder was not very good. And I stock up on snacks and water before the trip. Saves some money and I'm always hungry when it's not time to eat.
I'm a woman. I get turned on more by pictures of naked women than men. Is this normal??	My wife is like this. She is straight and has no desire to be with a woman, however, she can see a sexy woman in a porn and she thinks it's hot. We've watched lesbian porn before and she's dug that. It's understandable as the female body is just much more attractive than the male body.	Yes, it's normal. I tend to be the same way. I've seen studies that explain it this way. Heterosexual women sometimes feel a lot of anxiety about looking right when having sex. We may be more likely to be turned on by the sight of an attractive woman than by a man because the fantasy of being that woman makes us feel free to express our sexuality. EDIT TL;DR To a horny straight female, a hot naked woman is the subject of her fantasy, not the object.
Are there penises drawn all over womens bathroom stalls?	most public women's bathrooms I've been to don't have anything written on them. maybe the occasional name or quote but really we don't do that kind of stuff.	Not too many, but sometimes I see them in the crappier bar bathroom stalls. Usually I just see motivational messages "YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!" or something about pooping.
What are some common "Boomer" Advice/Tactics that just don't work anymore?	This sounds like less of a "boomer generation" problem and more like a "your parents are kind of shitty" problem.	"Go down to the company and hand them your CV." Loads of places don't even accept CVs and want you to fill out a ten page application form, undergo a psychometric test, do an arithmetic test and a situational-awareness test just to even be considered for a ten minute phone interview. It's an employer's market these days and they will make you jump through hoops for even the smallest position in their company if they can.
When a friend/SO vents to you about a problem they're having, are you more likely to be a listener, or a problem solver?	With my best friend I just listen and nod until she starts to run out of steam and I can jump in and real her irrationality back in. I prefer people to just listen to me and not offer advice unless I ask for it.	I'm a problem solver. But if the problem they want to solve is the need for someone to listen and support without judgment or suggestion, I do my best to do that.
Everyone has that one girl they can’t get out of their heads. What’s she like? Are you with her?	This one girl in my spanish class Don't know her name but she had a really fat ass, I was pretty astonished by it Yes I am shallow and don't know her name, grade, etc.	>What’s she like? I honestly don't know anymore. But back when I saw her every day she was perfect. >Are you with her? No, and almost certainly never will be. I'll have to find another.
Why was your worst date the worst?	He took me to an Ethiopian restaurant (I’m all for trying new foods so it wasn’t the fact that this was something new, but extremely daring for a first date) then took me to that god-awful movie The Wolfman that came out in 2010. At the end of the date he tried to feel me up while he drove me home. I never spoke to him again after telling him that it wouldn’t work out.	It was at a very Christian university where he lived in an all boys dorm. He paraded me around to each room just to prove he actually brought a girl home and made a big show out of closing the door "for privacy." Proceeded to make me sit on the floor the whole time because the only seat in his room was his bed and he wasn't allowed to share a bed with a woman til marriage. Saw him again anyway 🤦🏽‍♀️
Why is it considered shameful to visit prostitutes? Do you think this stigma is justified?	Because it is easy sex. Women don't like the price go vagina being reduced by prostitution, and men don't like the idea of other men getting easy sex with hot chicks while they have to work so hard for it. Notice that relatively low priced prostitution with attractive women is viewed the most negatively, while more expensive prostitution is more acceptable. People don't complain about $5000 methed-up legal hookers in Nevada who have to give half their earning to their pimp, oops, I mean brothel owner. They complain about $20 hookers.	It's seen as shameful because it's basically admitting: >"I can not find any women who want to have sex with me, so I have to pay someone to do it." It's similar (but more extreme) to the stigma that online dating has: >"I can not find any women who want to date me, so I have to go online to find someone willing." Dudes get judged on their ability to attract women and both of the above situations spell out that they're not able to.
How do you handle your parents' mortality?	People die, deal with it. The end. I'll get downvoted but that's how I deal with it. My dad died 12 years ago from a random malady that struck quickly and surprisingly. I mourned for a short while, and still do sometimes when I think about him, but overall I got over it and carried on. Death is a part of life. You can't help it. No sense letting someone's else's death ruin your current life is the way I see it.	I went through this thought experiment not too long ago. What I kept finding was that even in the worst case scenario, the only thing that gave me mental peace was acknowledging that the best thing that I can do in life, is enjoy every moment I have left with all my loved ones. That way when they eventually leave this existence, you can always fall back on knowing that you did your best under those circumstances. Because that is the only thing we have control over in this reality, don't worry about the things that are out of your control, worry about what you CAN do from now on and enjoy every minute of it. That's how I found mental peace in my loved ones dying.
Women of AskMen, what brings you to AskMen?	It's way better than that feminist crap all over askwomen. I feel like I have more of a male-ish mind anyway. I also enjoy dirty humor and not discussing makeup or tampons lol.	I like answering questions. The community here is fun. I like learning about male opinions. The modding/community on askwomen is stifling. I received a lot of vitriol and harassment from angry *male* users when I posted on askwomen because they were lurking there to find someone to be a dick to. I can't say "be a dick" on askwomen. Askreddit is full of more teenagers than this sub already is.
If you found out that your 12-year-old son was sexually harassing women online, what would you do?	I agree with taking away Internet. I would also make him write a 20 page report on rape culture and misogyny. Without the internet. He would have to do some good old library research. He would also have to start volunteering at women's shelters. I hope though, like drugs or sex, this is something I would already have spent some time educating both all of my children about.	No internet, no games. He'd have to read his comments out loud in front of his father and I, and we'd have a long discussion about why he wrote those things and why it was wrong to do so.
Fellow men, what the hell just happened?	/r/pussypass in fucking action. No man would have gotten away with that. You should've knocked her ass to the ground to teach her a lesson.	This stuff happens all the time. I'm a gay guy and I had a woman accuse me of staring at her tits. I was just looking around and I made brief eye contact with her and continued on searching for male eye candy. She struts over and yells at me in front of a crowd. Fortunately, a few minutes after she departed, my then boyfriend came back from a nearby CVS, and kissed me on the mouth. The same folks who were there saw that and shifted their eyes towards the woman who quickly gathered her things and slipped away. Dignity restored.
What are your favourite uses for coconut oil?	I add it to my coffee! It's better if you blend it (it's more frothy) or you can just drop a teaspoon in hot coffee, it'll melt at room temp. The first time I tried it I couldn't figure out how I had spent five hours cleaning the entire house and still had a ton of energy. After doing some research, it turns out that it's great for your metabolism - helps break down bad fats and boosts energy levels.	I'm a guy but I stumbled in... I use it as an aftershave and never have razor burn or razor bumps with it. That may help a few of you... I'm leaving now...
I got told that having a popsocket wasn't manly. What's the dumbest thing that an insecure dude "called you out" on for being "effeminate"?	I was at the bar one day during the winter and was wearing this “ugly” yellow sweaters (you know the ones that look like your grandma made) and this dude kept calling me “gay” for wearing a yellow sweater...I shrugged it off for a while before eventually inviting him outside to “talk” about it. He declined the invitation.	They were selling bottled water at an event and the bottles were made of pink plastic because a portion of the proceeds off the sale of said water bottle went to beat cancer research benefits. Despite the fact that it was sweltering hot and everyone was dripping sweat and proceeds went to a good cause, some guy created a huge kerfuffle because he refused to carry around a pink water bottle and insisted the staff try to find him one that was less threatening.
What are the unspoken things about having a baby?	When you have a new baby, you're obsessed with them. It's like you are falling in love, but even more powerful.	I knew I would still look about six months pregnant after giving birth. But what surprised me was how disgusting my stomach felt. Kind of like jello. I just avoided touching my stomach for weeks.
Women with partners 10+ years younger, what is your relationship like?	I'm 56 partner is 24. I thought I'd be showing him some great sex tricks but I wS pleasantly surprised about how much he knows!! He's the best sexual partner I've ever had. We like to play mommy son public. So if you're sitting somewhere where we have an audience I will ask him "son have you done your chores " and say a few other things where people obviously think we are mother and son and then I will suddenly start kissing him passionately on the mouth.	I’m 45 and my husband is 33. Honestly, I never think about our ages anymore. In the beginning of our relationship (4 years ago) I was very insecure because I was done having children (per my doctor) and I knew he always thought he would have at least one biological child. Then I went on a diet, lost weight, my health improved and on my 43 rd birthday I got the surprise of my life and found out I was expecting. 2.5 years later we have a two year old son. I used to always feel like he had more energy than me but now we’re both exhausted. But so happy.
What quality do you look for in a man that you feel like men often overlook?	Don't need a provider. Want a partner. Been making my own fucking money since I was 14, when I started tutoring.	The ability to admit they don't know. One of our first dates with my husband, my car was having trouble. I asked him if he could look at it. He said, "I can open the hood and stare at it and tell you it's an engine, if that's what you mean. But I haven't a clue what would be wrong with it." I've been with SO MANY MEN (dad and brothers included) who feel they have to solve it even if they don't know. I love a man who can admit they don't. And then go out and get the learning to know in the future.
Women with children, when did you think you would have your first child? When did you end up having your first child?	I figured around 25 is when I’d have my first, I wanted to get some kind of post secondary education done before and didn’t go to college straight out of high school. My SO and I found out I was pregnant in August at 22 just before starting an condensed program that turned a 2 year course into a 14 week course and I finished in December and I’ll be turning 23 just before my due date so it all kind of worked out.	I thought I would have my first kid at 25. Hah. I didn't even have a partner at that point in my life. I ended up having my first when I was 32.
what is the worse absolutely most dreadful sex story that you have?	When my ex and I had first gotten together, we moved into her mom's one bedroom duplex. Well, my ex's brother and his family were visiting from out of town so my ex and I were sleeping in her mom's room *and* bed for the night. I was under the blanket going down on my ex, her mom opens, the door, comes in and says "Oh, looks like you two are having fun." She turned right around, left and shut the door. My ex immediately started crying. **TL;DR** - My ex's mom walked in on me going down on her daughter while we were sleeping in her bed.	Met a random at the bar. Went back to my place and we spent all night having sex. At one point, I went to the bathroom to clean myself up a bit and prepare for another round. When I came out, he was squatting naked in my kitchen, a bottle of olive oil on the ground next to him, and his fist shoved up his own ass. Awesome for him for knowing what he wants. Not so awesome to (1) surprise me with it and (2) use my fucking food to get it done.
If you were friends with your S.O. before you started dating, how did your relationship change from platonic to romantic?	I tried to set my now-boyfriend up with my then-best friend, only to have him reject and ghost her brutally 2 days later. I didn’t have an explanation when she found out we were dating 2 weeks following him rejects her.	We had both recently ended other relationships we were in, and moved out of a flat we shared. Two things happened: 1. Because we weren't flatmates anymore, we actually had to schedule time to see each other. That little change made our hang outs feel WAY more like dates. 2. I was pretty good friends with his ex girlfriend. This one time, we were hanging out and I was trying to figure out why he broke up with her and we just ended up spending hours talking about romantic relationships and what we each wanted in a partner. We were pretty much describing each other. I didn't realize it at the time, but apparently he did. We've been married for 5 years now. It's been great. We did good.
Women who grew up being told to always forgive and be nice even to hurtful people, how long did it take you to develop a backbone and healthy boundaries as an adult? Was the transition period awkward?	I've always had a backbone. I was taught to "be better" than the people that hurt me. A common phrase my mother and grandmother told us growing up was something along the lines of "forgive everyone, but do not, under any circumstances, forget what they did or how it made you feel".	I’m still transitioning tbh. In asian cultures we’re taught to “not make a scene” or “just be the bigger person.” I also think that because of this it really strengthened my patience in people but you come to point you realize that you’re pretty much getting taken advantaged of knowing that you probably won’t say a thing.
How much do women enjoy sex without orgasm?	I enjoy the sex itself but without an orgasm I'd get frustrated. Luckily it nearly never happens. I feel really sorry for women that never had an orgasm because I think they're only okay with having sex without it because they don't know what they're missing. And I'm pretty sure every woman is able to have an orgasm. It's just about trying and figuring out how it works for you.	I've never had an orgasm, but i still really enjoy sex with my boyfriend because it feels good (duh) but also because of the intimacy
Women of Askmen, what do you look like (Summer 2017 edition)?	Holy shit, lurkers out in full force today. Not even talking about the women either: where did all the pathetic-ass "marry me pls" motherfuckers come from? Y'all know who you are, some of this shit was sad af to read. None of us like to be called 'creepy'; ***well don't be fucking creepy then.***	Holy shit, lurkers out in full force today. Not even talking about the women either: where did all the pathetic-ass "marry me pls" motherfuckers come from? Y'all know who you are, some of this shit was sad af to read. None of us like to be called 'creepy'; ***well don't be fucking creepy then.***
Women who said "no" when their SO asked them to get married: how did they take it and did you tell them why?	He's asked on and off for years now, more often recently as he's getting older- we are well past the halfway stage of a relationship now. He asks, I say no, he asks why, I explain its pointless, repeat in six months.	I'm not sure if this counts but he asked me during sex while he was drunk. I told him he couldn't do that and what was he thinking? He realized his error the next day and it was just an ongoing joke between the two of us. Eventually he proposed for real. We're married now... he still says inappropriate things at inappropriate times but I love him and he'll do.
What hobby is welcoming and inclusive for beginners?	At least in my experience, pinball. There aren't that many people involved in it anyway, so they're very happy to welcome new people, and the more experienced players will give you helpful tutorials on scoring and basic flipper skills. They'll also often waive entry fees for new/novice players, so you won't have as much to lose!	Board games! There are games for all levels of players, and I find most gamers to be welcoming whether you're super nerdy into it or just casual.
Children of parents who fight a lot, what's the most ridiculous thing your parent has told you after an argument with their spouse?	This is going back to the 80s. My mom used to tell me that "Kids need a father, that's the reason I stay with him." Which to 8 year old me meant "You're the reason I'm so horribly unhappy." My childhood sucked and I'm pretty sure it's why I have no romantic life and very little social life. What I learned about romance and marriage and such turned me off from women in general. And unfortunately, every woman I've ever dated or tried to date reinforced the notion that I'm just not cut out for love.	My mom and dad came home after a day out and were arguing about something and it was a pretty bad to the point where my mom was crying and she said to me, 'One day it might just be you and me'. I never thought my parents would get divorced and I was about 9 so I cried. The next day my mom and dad made up and my mom told me to disregard what she said.
What are your thoughts on Puerto Rican statehood?	Once they have completed bankruptcy I would be happy for them to become the 51st state. They already get all the right and privileges for the most part so why not. Unfortunately the republican party will put a stop to it because they are afraid they will be a democratic state if admitted. (same for D.C)	If Puerto Rico becomes a state, then they should add two additional states as well to get up to 53, a prime number. "One nation, indivisible..."
African American Male Here. How many of you women out there are just completely not attracted to African Americans?	it depends on a guy! yesterday i saw the most beautiful/cool looking guy ever and he was black. edit: though i had stuff stolen by black guys so now i'm afraid of them, it depends on how they dress now. though a lot of black ppl live here.	British white woman here. I'm as likely to find a nice man with dark skin as attractive as a nice man with light skin. The key for me, personally, is the "nice man" bit. Having said that, a person's culture has an effect. I'm much more likely to be comfortable around and actually act on an attraction with someone who has similar cultural background to me (eg, Dark-skinned guy born and raised in London, yes - dark-skinned guy born and raised in Kenya, probably not).
Men of Askmen, what are the tell-tale signs of instability in a woman?	1, Too much makeup, collagen lips, constant selfies, basically too much time on looks. 2, if she treats other people badly, talks too much trash about others (or generally always speaking negatively about others) and loves drama.	* Abusive childhood or upbringing in general - not necessarily a red flag but many people with abusive childhoods never learned healthy coping skills because of the toxicity around them. Counseling can help though. * Being emotionally unavailable * Always says how much she "hates drama". That may be the case but it doesn't even occur to someone to say that unless they are riddled with drama in their lives. * They have no ability to enforce personal boundaries * They don't respect other peoples boundaries either. * They're a "fixer". * They take the worlds problems on their shoulders. * Everything bothers them, they can't let small things just roll off their backs * All their problems are caused by someone else; they can't accept responsibility for anything. * Had a kid at a super young age
What's the grossest thing you and your SO have done together?	Having sex on the top of a mountain after hiking in Colorado. The only gross part was not having anything to clean up with.	He bit off my hang nail once because I was driving and needed it off immediately but I was not trying to mess up my lipstick so I couldn’t do it myself
What's something someone said to you that at the time made you angry but you've since realised they were right?	My father refused to pay for college because women should be baby-makers. I had three children and then I put myself through college. He was sorta right. I prize my children way more than my degree.	My best friend since 4th grade and I had a pretty bad falling out right before we graduated. She told me all I do is talk about myself. I was so mad and we didn't talk for about 2 years. We reconnected in college as we got into the same scholars program at our university. Within those 2 years we didn't talk, I realized how right she was and decided to work on myself and try to take a step back and listen to others more.
What is the stupidest or most pointless free gift you've ever got with a purchase?	I bought a >€1000 handwound wristwatch from Stowa in Germany. When it arrived, it included a Stowa-branded cheap plastic tumbler, like you might get your drink in at a carryout pizza place.	I hate pens! I'm up to my ass in bird pens and flower coasters from British Red Cross. At Ryman's once the cashier asked me if I'd like to donate to Sports Relief, so I said okay, and then he told me to take a free pen. And I refused and he kept insisting. So finally I took a pen and I can't even use it because it has a rattle on the end of it. And they're always blue ink, why are they always blue ink? Black is so much better. Argh.
Women with a SO whose culture is vastly different from yours: what were some of your cultural learning curves?	I am a french Canadian from Alberta and he is a Quebecois (they don't refer to themselves as Canadians most of the time so ya). Although we speak the same language, the cultures are VASTLY different. He doesn't see a need to celebrate Canada Day or Thanksgiving. He's much more open with his sexuality and comfortable with PDA's and touching my butt in public....where I grew in a conservative province where those things just aren't done in public! His family is very open in general about things where mine are more reserved. So ya, same background from way before but somewhere along the way the culture changed. I'm more "anglocized" than he is.	I'm American, he's German. Maybe not a vast cultural difference between us, but from my personal experience, German directness is not a stereotype. If I were thin-skinned we'd have some real problems. Example: One time we were Skyping and he asked me if I had lost weight. I responded, "No, why do you ask?" Him: "Oh, your double chin doesn't look as prominent as it usually does." THANKS BABE
How many bowls of cereal is too many?	Honestly, 1 is too much. Cereal is what I like to call human dog food, it just makes you fat. It's nutritionally worthless and you'd better off eating bacon and eggs.	For me, it's one. A single bowl is all it takes to open Pandora's Box and I awaken in a stupor surrounded by empty boxes of cheerios. I love cereal too much and I cannot be trusted alone with it, so not even once.
What kind of things were you told growing up about virginity and purity?	The more I learn about how some parents and even schools go on and on about purity etc., the more grateful I am to grow up in a country where such religious indoctrination is really rare. I would have like some more about feelings in our sex-ed, but at least it was fact based and promoted safety. My parents never said much, because they sort of came to it after school did, but they always stressed that I should be sure to only be with nice people.	No one ever said anything about purity to me. I think that's more of an American thing and I'm in the UK. I was told about contraception by my mum, older sister and school, and told not to rush into anything but that was about it.
Have you ever completely lost respect for a friend because of something they said or did? What happened?	I've had several male friends in the past reveal themselves to be sadistic or racist. So I cut them out of my life and now I don't make friends with men.	One ex-friend pretended to have incurable thyroid cancer (given survival rates of this type of cancer she should have faked other type to be more convincing). Another friend/roommate started dating guy I was seeing behind my back, moved in with him and didn't pay her portion of rent in our apartment. The landlord couldn't get in touch with her so he called me several times a week asking about her. F*ck them. I have better friends now.
Inspired by the “swipe left” AskMen post - Why are women more accepting of overweight men than the reverse?	Because women aren’t as fickle as some men can be. Yeh looks are important, but honestly personality is more important to me. I’ve dated some average and even below average dudes based on what seemed like a good personality.	Popular media plays a role (as others have mentioned). Just think about all the tv shows where there's a heavier set hubby with an amazingly attractive and/or fit/slim woman. Family Guy, The Simpsons, The Sopranos, Fresh Prince, King of Queens, etc. Even Cersei Lannister and Robert Baratheon for crying out loud. Edit to add: how much you want to bet most of the dudes who said "fat" was a dealbreaker are, indeed, fat themselves?
What is your opinion of women who say they would leave their boyfriend if he doesn't propose within a certain amount of time?	I think they're idiotic. I think anyone who makes any major relationship decision around a time requirement is dumb and I would not date them. It raises what is probably the biggest red flag to me: She doesn't actually want to be with *me*, and just wants to be with *someone*. Also that she is incredibly driven by societal 'norms'.	I mean, if marriage is part of your long term plan, I get it. You don't waste time with people you're incompatible with in the long term. But I'd hope there'd be a discussion about your plans for the future and if and when marriage would be a thing, rather than an arbitrary deadline.
What is your job? How much money do you make? Would you recommend your role to others?	I am a bank teller for a nation wide bank. I make about 13000 a year but only work 20 hours a week. I get amazing benefits including legal services and 24/7 therapy. The company all together is very customer and employee focused. Tons of opportunities for career options. I personally don't like my life to be focused on work much rather on my family and son. I would definitely recommend my job. You do unfortunately work around a lot of females so it gets a little tough.	Crime data analyst for a private corporation. I made 42k a year starting out, and make 52k with two years of experience. It's really interesting work but the pay isn't fantastic considering I have a Masters degree, and there can be weird personel issues as well. Private companies pay better than state and city governments of course, but the government pay is so low that the companies don't have to go much higher to lure people in. I love crime, but I'm thinking of changing industries because the pay is better in finance or healthcare.
What conversation are you sick and tired of having?	"I am sooo depresed look at me and give me so attention!" - not trivialize depresion, it's serious health issue, but most of the people who are starting this conversation (most of the people I have experience with) are just attention seeking. When I hear that someone claims that s/he has this condition I hear them out but... Hey... Most of the people who claims to be depresed don't even know what depresion is. (most of the people I have experience with)	my extended family (aunts/uncles) asking about my family (bro/sis/mom) who i haven’t spoken to in years. they don’t understand how much it hurts to talk about it but still bring it up and seem like I’m so comfortable talking about it
[21M] How to stop being feminine?	A lot of the answers in this thread are simply overly idealistic, or don't understand the reality of the current situation in terms of the world and sex/gender...If being who you are hasn't worked for the better part of 30yrs, it's time to be someone else. This is going to sound contrived, but you'll need to start small. I would suggest watching media about masculinity. MadMen and fight club. Really think about them. Find someone you like. Try to incorporate some minor behaviors. For example... Talking too fast feminine. Spend a month slowing down your speech. Pay attention to the way you stand. Etc.	You can: 1. Start working out and bulk up, and stop hanging out with women all the time. OR 2. Just fucking own it. Hang out with whoever you like to hang out with and behave how you behave. If someone thinks you fit their stereotypical definition of feminine, fuck 'em. You be you.
Men who’s SO had plastic surgery after your relationship with them began, what were your thoughts about it?	its not for the man it's the woman's choice. as a guy, i would only ever want my partner to get surgery if that's truly what they wanted to feel better-there's probably a reason im with this woman pre surgery that part of me would be disappointed in seeing her change. but then you love the person first ultimately and everything else second. i couldn't handle being with someone who was trying to modify themselves for me or future partners. that would just be sad unless it was truly necessary/lifechanging and god, if a guy ever convinces a woman to get surgery for him, that guy is straight up EVIL. no i'm not married, no i've not been with a woman who got surgery later. but i answered anyway	Had breast augmentation. Was all for it. Had great results. Biggest lift was in her self esteem. Clothes fit better and confidence went through the roof. That was 19 yrs ago and we just celebrated 30 years marriage. She just farted in the bed next to me.
Why is _________ still a thing?	Just a reminder, this is not a debate subreddit. Go take a walk outside or something if your instinct is to "play devil's advocate" or argue someone's experiences because you just need to fight.	Just a reminder, this is not a debate subreddit. Go take a walk outside or something if your instinct is to "play devil's advocate" or argue someone's experiences because you just need to fight.
Women who left their spouses at the altar, what happened?	My last two fiancees lost their minds before we could get married. Mental health is hard. Hopefully, third times the charm.	He had been abusive and was an alcoholic. He cheated on me and blamed it on my family and tackled me when I tried to leave. So I played along and agreed we'd get married in and move to another state away from my family. I was supposed to meet him there and get married the day I arrived. I never got on the plane and changed my phone number and quit my job.
When you're sleeping on your period, how do you stop a blood flood from spewing out the top of your ass crack?	Literally nothing. Haha You’re not supposed to wear a tampon overnight and I’m too wimpy to try those cups, so I just suffer through. If I wake up randomly in the night, great! I can clean myself up a bit. But during the first 2 nights of my period, that’s what’ll happen. I’ve made my peace with it.	I tend to find I need /less/ protection at night then during the day, gravity works in my favour I guess. But then I have a mad dash to the toilet when I get upright again
What's the worst reason an ex said when breaking up with you?	"I need to find myself" bitch you're 14, you're not gonna find yourself for another 10 years. We did end up getting together off and on for like 10 years after that though. Consider her my soulmate, just not in this lifetime.	Out of the blue after 2 years together: Her:"I'm not attracted to you at all" Me:"Is it there someone else?" Her:"There is literally everyone else..."
AW: What are *you* aroused by and why?	Good singing and dancing. Never knew why to be honest. A girl who can sing can damn near have me do anything she wants. Also girls who do robotics and are good at math and cs.	Really awesome dude-scent. Like some men smell so amazing. Deep voices, especially when they get all whispery. Teasing. Competence and confidence combined with genuine kindness. The ability to make me laugh. Nothing makes me develop a crush faster than a good sense of humor.
Men who play one or more instruments, why and how did you start learning?	I started playing guitar about 20 years ago. I watched a Pantera home video with a live version of the song "Domination" on it. When I saw what Dimebag Darrell was doing during the solo I was in awe and knew I wanted to be just like him. My best friend had started playing guitar a little before then so he and I basically were teaching each other how to play... No lessons, just reading guitar mags, watching videos and showing each other what we picked up. Edit: this is what made me start playing https://youtu.be/Sde_CBWVp3Y	I've played a lot of different instruments through my life: piano, guitar, saxophone, cello, and drums. The only one I'm good with is guitar, been going strong for years. And I use piano for beat production, but it's nothing special. Why did I start learning? Because music is fucking awesome. Playing it and writing your own is a better experience than just listening to it in my opinion.
Former Nice Guys™, what incident finally snapped you out of it?	When I found out I was tired of getting stepped on. I didn't stop being nice I just started to get what I wanted and I was happier.	I guess the girl I was into stopped paying me any attention, so I just said fuck it and did what I wanted. It hasn't had much success overall, but I'm not being a dumb ass, so that's good enough.
What are your cheap, homemade lunches that make your working day better?	I generally try not to eat during the day, but when it is super cold out and I need something cozy/cheap I always like a nice chunky tomato basil soup.	Chicken salad with crackers. I buy a rotisserie chicken at Costco and pick it clean, then dice it up real fine. Finely diced celery & white onion, a little mayo, a squirt of ranch, and dill. It is so light and fresh and doesn't give me that afternoon draggy feeling.
On average, how unsafe do you feel around random guys?	I don't trust any men ever. Even ones I've known for years because they often act trashy whenever they can. I have had a LOT of bad experiences with men (I mean a looooottt) so I am polite at first but cautious always.	Mostly I feel pretty safe. But you bet your ass I never give my number to strangers. That's a rookie mistake.
How jealous do you get in a relationship?	Um, not at all? If a woman is dating me then that means that she wants me more than other men in her life. If she behaves inappropriately with other men then she's not worth keeping around. Being jealous is a waste of time.	I feel like the odd man out here. I get jealous pretty often. I've had problems with it actually, the thing is I think it's apart of my nature. I could pretend I don't get jealous but that would be a lie. Best way to deal with it for me is just ignoring the feeling and realizing that my mind makes thing annoyingly complicated most times and to not listen to it all the time.
Why do short guys think they have no hope with girls?	Because they're looking for something to blame their failure on other than their personality. If I get rejected because I'm a jerk, weird, creepy, an ass, a pervert, etc, that's something I can control. I'm a jerk. If I get rejected because I'm short, then it's out of my control, so SHE is the jerk.	Because being short *is* a disadvantage. Obviously you can compensate for it, as you have since you're handsome and fit, but in general, short is seen as less attractive than tall by most women. I disagree with the doom and gloom that short people on reddit like to peddle, but it's naive to think their doom and gloom is purely in their heads. It's an unfortunate response to an accurate assessment. The proper response is to do what it takes to improve your attractiveness, like getting fit, not lying down and dying. If a lot of girls aren't into short guys, they're even less into Debbie Downers that just give up.
For those of you who were in an abusive relationship, when was the first instance of abusive behaviour?	Telling me that he didn't care about something I was really passionate about and didn't want me to talk about it in front of him. Also, telling me he thought less of me because I was considering doing grassroots activism as a post-college job.	He spit in my face in public. I walked away from him and he yelled after me. I stopped walking away so he would stop causing a scene and *somehow* at the end of the night he managed to get me to apologize both for making him spit in my face and for embarrassing him by walking away. Abuse, whether mental or physical, is a piecemeal process and will make you a total stranger to yourself - I still am horrified at the things I used to put up with and still have trouble figuring out how I let things get to severity they got to.
How do I get over the dating-is-a-pain-in-the-ass feeling?	Dont-fucking-date. What is it with americans and their obsession around dating?? If it doesn't feel right, don't do it, how complicated is that? Dating is not the only way to meet someone, jesus christ. A lot of people don't meet their SO through active dating, they simply end up in the same context. This grinds my gear something ridiculously.	By reframing it as "meeting people", and focusing on that aspect, independent of outcome. Try to look at it as "maybe I'll meet someone who knows a lot about wine, I've always wanted to know more but I'm too lazy to read up on it". Or "I wonder what this persons last holiday trip was to, I'm looking for some cool destinations". And as other poster say, keep the first date short and more of a meet and greet-- if it becomes more, that's ok, but if it doesn't, that's cool too.
What's your "did I really just get hit on?" story?	whenever I get hit on when I have no makeup on, put 0 effort into my appearance, it’s actually pretty nice because I don’t feel pretty if I’m not all done up... and I’m rarely ever done up lol.	​Shopping mall toy and gift shop, I'm looking at cute stuff. Guy walks up to me. 'You looking for toys for your kids?' Thinking he's an employee, I say 'Nope, just browsing' (I'm just a grown woman who still likes toys, sue me). 'Huh. So, you married?' I look him over, realizing he doesn't work there. 'Got a boyfriend, but yeah, pretty much' and flash him the ring I wear to indicate as much. 'But are you happy?' he asks. 'Yeah, I am, very much happy', I say, while thinking what the fuck, he thought I had kids and wanted to hit on me, then heard I'm attached and thinks I'd wanna cheat?! Then he asks this whopper - 'Don't you feel this chemistry between us?' 'No,' I say, 'I don't.' '​You don't?' (sounding baffled). 'No.' He walks off looking sincerely gobsmacked.
What could a woman tell you she wants to do that would blow your mind?	I honestly can't think of anything that would blow my mind with the fact that a woman wanted to sleep with me. It's really not quite ***that*** surprising. Maybe just hearing that a certain woman wanted to shtup me might blow my mind, but it'd have to be in fairly specific and unique contexts.	I had a lady whisper in my ear once ''Use me. Make me cry.''. Maybe not the most out ther or adventurous thing ever said but my mind was pretty well blown.
What are your thoughts on making the first move with women?	>sickens me. That seems a little extreme and I think you should examine where the root of that is. You might just be an asshole.	I stopped initiating for a while and it turned into not dating for 2-3 years. When I wasn't focused on dating, I had 7 nights a week to myself, all of my income was available for what I wanted to do, and despite sleeping alone every night, I still had a very fun and fulfilling life. Eventually doing that long enough (and trying to be mindful about my inner wants/needs), I was happy with who I was and the kind of life I was living, I felt more motivated to go out and initiate contact with the women. And once I did, I only went on a couple of dates before I found the woman that I've now been married to for the past 3 years. So I guess, if you don't feel it right now, then don't do it right now.
What are your most fun at home date ideas?	We make popcorn before a movie on the couch..... Then we cuddle a lot because our new couch is awesome. Also my new blanket is awesome. The cats are not awesome, though, and try to lay on the blanket.	Learn a skill or do a craft together. My fiancé and I aren’t terribly artistically inclined, but we like to go to craft stores and get packaged projects to do. We made a mosaic stepping stone, painted coffee cups, and etched beer mugs and wine glasses. I taught him how to crochet once, and we both tried sewing together.
Men, do you want to fall into traditonal gender roles?	Something you may not have noticed yet is that feminists tend to pick and choose which gender roles should be challenged. Woman expected to be in the kitchen? Unacceptable! Women receive lighter punishments than men for the same crime? Preferred! Women not 50% of Engineering degrees? Sexism! Men have 10% chance of getting custody of their kids? They can't take care of kids anyway!	Nah. Sometimes I fall into traditional roles, sometimes I don't. I never think "Is this a manly thing to do?" I think "Is this something I want to do?" and "Is this the right thing to do?"
What was your mom like growing up and how has it impacted your relationship now?	My mom was always easy going and let me do whatever I want...at the time I thought it was great but now I wish she would have been more strict with me. It took me an extra year to finish high school because I skipped class so much and there were plenty of other things I did that I shouldn't have because I knew I could get away with it. I'm not blaming her whatsoever but it would have been nice if she put her foot down every once in a while. That being said I still love my mother, I talk to her everyday, I can talk to her about anything and we're really close. I couldn't ask for a better mother.	She was really stand off-ish and distant. More than one friend who has met her has remarked she may have some kind of mental health issue or illness. I just remember that she was always exasperated with basic stuff (like loading the dishwasher) and said we were "really needy" for wanting bed time hugs or kisses. She was glad when we "outgrew" that and "stopped touching her." We're not close, and have very little contact now.
How often do you shower with your SO? Is it an important thing for the both of you?	At least once a week. It's nice to hold each other under the hot water. I dont soap up under the showerhead anyways, I step out into the cold half to lather and then go back.	Never, because unless you have at least two shower heads, someone is always cold. And if we did redo our bathroom to add another shower head or two, we would run through the hot water tank in about five minutes.
Why did you go No-Contact with your family, and how long has it been since you saw them or spoke to them?	I once went 3 months without talking to my mum. We live in the same house. Just got sick of her talking to me so i stopped responding.	They don't like me. It's really as simple as that. Every mistake I've made since birth is brought up over and over again. If I say something I'm 'too sensitive', if I don't react, they go a bit deeper. I've been in abusive relationships and these are the men my family like the most. Because they keep control of me. I finally stood up for myself this year, I'm 38, I wouldn't take this from friends so why should family be OK to do it? You get one life. Surround yourself with people who are true to you and actually care.
Women with babyfaces or who don't have a naturally "dominating" demeanor -- or who have been the type no one takes seriously for some other reason -- how do you handle that? For women who have a history of not being taken seriously but have overcome it, how did you do that?	I'm nearly 29 and I'm petite and look around 16-18. I have a baby face because of my genetics and no one can take me seriously until I start writing. I know how to write and overcome that and it tends to infuriate people for some reason. They probably think I'm young and have no educated opinion, but I sure show them!	I'm a teacher, I'm 5'3, baby face, still get trouble for it (from students and parents). Honestly I'm pretty patient and I try to work around not being taken seriously by negotiating and being calm about issues, AKA act like an adult. But at work I use my superior as a backup protection - if I'm having trouble with a student or a parent, principal will have my back. I've also learned throughout the years to speak more firmly and assert myself without having to yell - although I have yelled as a very last resort. Basically I learned not to fear defending myself or assert my boundaries or enforce rules.
Fellow men, are there any "yes" answers to asking a lady out that just sour you instantly on the date?	Sure, but I need to be home by ten so I can wake up early for Church in the morning.	"Yes, my boyfriend is out of town/working/going out with his friends so that's perfect." " Yes, I'm still living with my ex so he can watch our son/daughter." Either way, run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.
Men who bullied gay kids in school...why did you do it?	C'mon guys/gals, don't downvote commenters simply because someone did something in the past. That's not "getting even", that's just being petty.	C'mon guys/gals, don't downvote commenters simply because someone did something in the past. That's not "getting even", that's just being petty.
Are braless women really that distracting?	No more than a girl with a bra on. My best bud's SO doesn't wear bras and they're a C size. I honestly have never noticed, nor has it inclined me to look any more than I have been to look at any other girl.	Guys are going to look at your boobs no matter what. And depending on a few factors, they might look a little longer if you're not wearing a bra. Don't overthink it though, and definitely don't feel shameful for doing what feel comfortable for you. If that means not wearing a bra, so be it. Any guy that does give you unwarrented amounts of attention is going to have done it bra or no bra.
Why do so many people want to travel?	I feel perfectly content staying home and reading a great book! Traveling is for people who lack imagination. One of the perks you get form not traveling is fantastic skin and lack of wrinkles.	Food. I like traveling because even if you live in a pretty diverse city, there's still other foods you can't get where you live. Also, physically going to see some pretty sights that are way more amazing in-person. This one isn't far from home, but I went to a pretty big church when I was younger. It's 3 stories high. The view from the top when it was Autumn was one of the most amazing things. A snap from my phone couldn't have done it any justice.
Where do you live and in what ways do you feel like you fit in with the rest of the population, and in what ways are you different?	I feel like a damn fish out of water here the only things people care about are their ~careers~ and how much money they god damn make. So this town is full of boring yuppies.	I live in London. Like most Londoners, I like to complain about the weather. Unlike most Londoners, I like people.
How did an abortion affect your relationship?	I've had two abortions, both very near twenty weeks, both surgical. One to save my life, one due to disability of the fetus. We had already established prior to the pregnancy that I would get an abortion in case of bad test results. My husband was and is completely supportive. We are still together. No regrets, no depression other than wishing that the fetuses had been healthy, and our relationship is still strong. Don't be afraid. You have plenty of time to have a child when you are ready for it. Having children changes your life forever and is not something that people should feel forced into due to societal pressure.	I knew 100% that I didn't want anymore kids. We had one kid already when I was 19 and he was 21. Well two years later I was pregnant. I had an abortion at 5 wks. He was completely ok with it and supportive. Our daughter is 9 now and we are both still sure we're one and done. I've been using a long term bc with better effectiveness rates. We've been together for 11 years and married for 2. We've gone through so much over the years, the abortion was just one more thing we were able to work through.
What is the worst pickup line/method a girl tried to use on you?	Just saying "hey" or "hi" It's epidemic levels on dating websites/apps. Girls have no game, because they think they don't need it.	She had a friend ask me if I would date her, while she was standing right next to me. It was very uncomfortable.
Ladies, what are some of your best "This is why I'm single" moments?	When other girls in my class tell me that guys are afraid to come up to me because of how I look (I wear heels and professional wear, and I do my makeup and hair every morning) and how I carry myself (I try to be eloquent, respectful, and professional at all times because of the career I want). That's when I realize that this is why I'm single. And until someone has the confidence to approach me and hold an intellectual conversation, it's going to stay that way. Not that I'm complaining.	Well, I just sent this text to my friend today, and I think it about sums it up: "God I want to die. I want to die right now. Some hot dude passed me going the opposite way on my run loop. I sped up so we could meet up at the halfway point and he would see how badass I am bc I matched his run time. I ended up getting past the gate and just started barfing, he ran past as I was puking and was like "ARE YOU OKAY?!" All I could muster was a smile and "Damn hills." I want to die. " So. There ya go.
Those of you who can afford to live independently but choose to live with parents in the meantime, what's your view on the American tradition of moving away from home asap?	Shortsighted and immature. One of my latino friends is an engineer. He lives in the south, makes like $80k/year, and lives with his parents. If I had to guess, I'd say he saves $50k/year.	It's weird to me. Being Asian, it's normal to stay with our families into our mid to late twenties or even until we get married. Yeah it sucks sometimes when my mom still calls to ask me where I am, but it's something that I can put up with for not having to paying +$1000 of rent a month. With this economy right now, there is a trend of a lot of people moving back in with their parents. Thank god, because I swear when I was on Okcupid, it was a deal breaker to a lot of white people to be living at home.
What's the most inappropriate compliment you've received, & how'd you react to it?	Women commenting on my breasts all the time no matter the context. Show someone a video of something beautiful on vacation that deeply moved me and they can only speak of the 2 second flash of my cleavage as I walk into frame. Proud of an art piece I told them I worked two years on? They laugh that they got distracted by my boobs as I gestured to it. In formal dress for the first time around them, having never seen me with makeup or my hair done? Boobs look great. Paired with grabbing them. I generally say something honest. "I wanted to show you where we spread my boyfriend's father's ashes as it was beautiful and I feel entirely disrespected by you." And going forward I remove them from my life beyond 'smile as we pass' acquaintances. The fact this was* being down voted speaks volumes heh.	Had a man open my car door in a parking lot to tell me I was beautiful and ask if I had a boyfriend. I said I had a girlfriend. He said I was too pretty to be a lesbian, and I was wearing a dress and lesbians wear pants. Top two in less than three minutes.
Women who have the time to prepare breakfast, workout and read all in the same day, how do you even do it?	Wake up earlier. Beyond that, it really comes down to utilizing time well. I watch a lot of TV, but on the treadmill, or workout while I do so. I plan my 25 hours really specifically so that I have time for everything that I want to do	I don't have kids or a SO. Every moment not at work is a moment I can do whatever I want.
What stereotype about guys do you dislike?	That i cant cook or take part in keeping my home clean. Seems i have to prove to everyone i meet, again and again, that the kitchen is my turf and my so gets permission to cook,not the other way around.	I'm not an endlessly horny maniac, an unfeeling monster, or an expendable stormtrooper. No matter what my particular sex's (undeserved) reputation is.
How do you build/maintain attraction with your SO?	Romantic love doesn't last - you can try and force and fake it but it never works. There's a point where a mental switch is needed - let go of the magic and welcome in reality - and reality says lasting relationships are partnerships, not Gabriel Garcia Marquez love stories lasting 50 years.	Keep doing fun things together. Be interested in their life/goals/dreams. Keep working on yourself (physically but not only) to stay (or become more) attractive. Also something that worked for me is semi regular (sexual) teasing when you're not together followed by awesome sex afterwards. The level of this heavily depends on both people involved of course but it's something I personally love doing and has worked in the past..
What is the one bad opinion you have about your male friends which you will never tell them?	You're a looser: fat, without much social interaction and you think of yourself a thousand times stronger and more intelligent than you are.	Friend 1: I don't think you should marry the girl you're about to marry. Friend 2: I hate how you turn every conversation into a diatribe on the war against drugs. Friend 3: I used to worry for your future because you were never particularly bright and struggled immensely in school. But holy shit have you turned things around. Proud of you, buddy.
Have you ever lost respect for your longterm SO or spouse? Why? Were you able to regain it?	Yes. Unfortunately. About a year after we started dating I found out he was sending sexually based messages to a "friend" he met and casually saw before we met. He told me it was over and that he wasn't going to speak to her anymore. I found out several months later that was a lie and it had continued. He just hid it better. I lost respect for him and his honesty. We are still together and its been a few years already. I've slowly regained that respect but it has taken a lot on my part to really try and put effort into the relationship and him. I think I have less respect for the "friend" than I do for my SO. Mostly because she knew we were dating and I'm guessing she just didn't care.	Yeah, because I came to the realization that things that were important to me meant nothing to him as long as he got his way. I had sold things to keep us afloat when he was in a rut that he always promised to replace, and never did, all the while buying himself new things. Also the way he ranted about how all Christians should die and his lack of apology when I pointed out that some of our very good friends were Christian. No, I didn't regain it. I decided I didn't like him as a person after that.
What's the weirdest thing a girl has done thinking it was sexy?	When ever my wife drinks more than a couple beers she starts to tell anyone who will listen about the size of my cock. She goes on and on. This has happened with neighbors, family members , her friends. When I ask her to please stop she just says "if you have it flaunt it". She seems to really enjoy it because she gets really wild in bed afterwards. However it makes me really uncomfertable. Yes, I have asked her to stop many times and she always says she will and she apologizes. Then it just happens again.	Buddies GF claimed she put all the veggies he had in the fridge in her vagina. So he could taste her when she wasn't around. That was just the tip of her crazy as we found out later.
what are some "bugs" in the human behavioral code?	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases So much interesting stuff there; so many ways for a person to be dead wrong but think they are right.	I want to buy something (a car, let's say). So I do a little research and find what I want. Search for cars matching those criteria. 1. "These guys want full price, fuck that!" 2. "This price is too good. There must be something wrong with it!"
What's your "holy grail" question that you always ask on a first date?	"Why do you think we would be good together?" I'm also all about the intense interview style first date. Reddit has informed me this is a terrible approach, but it worked out well for me when dating.	If marriage is something they want in their future. I don't flat out ask it, but I somehow work it into the conversation. It's not because I want to get married right away to the first guy who says yes. I've just already made the mistake of sticking around for someone who wasn't sure until it was too late to not be devastated by our different life goals.
I feel like we hear a lot from women who KNEW they either wanted or didn't want children. Those who were very much on the fence, how'd it turn out?	I was pretty convinced I didn’t want kids before I met my husband. I have a couple hereditary health issues and I’ve always thought that they simply weren’t fair. When I met him, I found out he also has a few and it’s one of the reasons we work so well together. One day, it clicked to me. I was afraid of forcing a child to potentially face some of the difficulties we had both faced, but if they inherit those things from us, they’ll also inherit our determination and perseverance and will be able to face anything. In short, I was afraid to have children until I met someone who brought out enough strength in me to change my mind. We are planning on starting fertility treatments in the spring (hey there hereditary health issues) and we will see if it is meant to be.	I’m ambivalent, and always have been, and I’m reaching the age where that’s a choice in itself. If I’d ever had a healthy and stable relationship with someone who really wanted a kid, I probably would have been open to having one. But my SO now is as ambivalent as I am, and I’ve never gotten knocked up accidentally (if I did, at this stage I’d probably keep it), so here we are. And that’s okay. My dad always told me the only reason to have a kid is if you truly knew you wanted to be a parent. I’ve never known that, and so I think at the end of the day it’s right that I never have, and probably never will.
What is a weird insecurity you have?	I have um... a large butt. I've been told it's a nice butt. And it's a good shape, and compliments my curves (by my boyfriend) but I'm just worried it's TOO big and I'll end up with a shelf back there. Not a fan of that possibility lol	I'm insecure about not ever being as good as I could be due not even due to any physical or emotional limitations but that I have this potential that I'm wasting and genuinely don't how to use said potential
Do you talk about other women while in a relationship?	I also think talking like that is crude, disrespectful, and breeds idolization outside of your relationship which IMHO is unhealthy. ***But*** I have always felt like a statistical outlier in this regard as I know many, many other men who do. For reference I'm a 27M in a 3+ year relationship. I will tell my SO if I think a female is attractive but the thought of banging anyone else is repulsive.	Its crude, but what men are really saying is: *I find her attractive enough, that if my circumstances were different, and she agreed, we would proceed to a physical relationship*
Has a woman ever told you she didn't want to have sex with you because she doesn't feel good about her own body?	No. If she did or thought like that, it'd mean she had very low self-esteem and needed to work on it by herself.	Here's a female POV, if you care for it. Truthfully, after reading her reason, my reaction was, "Wow, she's being really honest with him." It does sound like she has some deep-rooted insecurities she's trying to deal with (if she's wasn't dealing with them, I doubt she'd be so upfront). As far as how you handle it goes, I think this has more to do with her personal journey in life than her just comparing her body to yours (like in your example). I'd recommend just supporting her in it and asking her for ways you could do that (assuming you'd want to. If not, then it's more of a "whatevs" kind of deal).
What are some things you notice/pay attention to when you first enter a woman's room or house?	Where the female stuff is: panties, make up, teddy bears, etc Also, the smell. Usually, girls room smells very unique and nice. Also, I can know more about a girl by looking at her room's stuff, So I end noticing every detail that gives me information regarding the girl, like a detective	The smell. That's the first thing that registers in my mind before I notice anything visually. If it smells bad then the game has already been lost
Ladies, would you be offended as well?	No. I've worked in a male dominated field for nearly two decades now. If I got offended every time I ran into trivial sexism I never would have gotten any actual work done. Look, I'm not saying this is awesome. I'm saying I can choose to get offended and waste my time and energy on some silly thing a (possible) douche bag said, or I can let it slide of my back and let my competence speak for me. I have better things to do with my time than get upset about a silly person saying silly things.	From what I understand, unless your job is as a penis model or king, you don't have a man's job. EDIT: Did anyone else get this reference? Am I really that old?
What's the cutest/hottest thing a girl can wear on a first date?	Comfortable and a little proper. Keep all the sexy stuff for the second date at least. You won't be able to trick me on the first date. That's when my guard is at its highest, you wicked tigress! Seriously though, personally I am very careful the first date and in the beginning, so I do appreciate just regular clothing. Keep it away from addidas and soft clothing. Regular and proper makes you look serious and smart. I enjoy that.	Different guys have different tastes. But I'd say something that accentuates your physical traits, without spilling into the realm of looking trashy. If you have nice legs, maybe a medium length skirt or dress, for example.
What are some common advice that women give to men which are actually statistically unlikely to yield positive results?	The ole' "do the laundry and get more sex." You get sex by turning her on, not feminizing yourself or being a doormat.	"You have to stop looking; I promise that the perfect girl with come to you eventually." The promise/guarantee is what makes it so ridiculously absurd
What if I’m alone forever? It happens to a lot of men right?	PLEASE people.....use the search. This kind of "I suck at dating, what do?" questions are asked almost weekly, and the advice is always the same.	PLEASE people.....use the search. This kind of "I suck at dating, what do?" questions are asked almost weekly, and the advice is always the same.
"Feminism isn’t just about helping women, it’s about helping men too." So, feminists of /r/AskWomen, what have you recently done in the name of feminism to help end sexism and oppression towards men?	I really don't like the tone of your post and how you've put this question across. I don't know where you got this quote from, but I'd be interested in the source and context if it, because I think you may have misinterpreted it. Feminism IS about womens' rights. The notion that men can benefit from it may be what you're referring to, but that doesn't mean feminism is there to serve men. Men already have many of the privileges women are still fighting for. I realise you've already apologised for the use of the word "oppression", but that really is a horrible error. You're undermining the whole feminist movement by challenging feminists to answer to what they've done "to help men". Really, are you joking?	I told a coworker he needed to get a better lawyer because he shouldn't be paying child support on a child that he was led to believe was his after a marriage where his ex wife had married him in a state where she could get the most bang for his buck. He thinks he has to do it because he is a man and should help provide. I thought he was taking gender roles a little to seriously. Edit: I work with a lot of guys that are taken advantage of for their benefits. The amount of spouse/child support talks I hear at lunch is nuts.
How many of you take meds for your depression/anxiety? Or do you deal with your depression/anxiety in ways that don't involve meds?	I actually suffered with depression and anxiety for a few years until i decided to do a food fast. 23 days on nothing but water, lost 8 kg. Something happened on thw 23rd day something inside of me just snapped. I slowly got better. and am now in free from depression and debilitating anxiety. never been on meds.	SSRIs have been very effective at treating my anxiety but have had very little effect on my depression. So, I'm still dealing with that. I currently take Paxil. Doctor is considering adding something on to augment it. As for being dependent on meds, there's nothing wrong with that. People with diabetes are dependent on insulin. People with bad eyesight are dependent on glasses. You have an illness and you have every right to treat it.
Are you ok with your SO talking/texting with her ex? What if you found out she was doing it and didn't tell you?	I don't care. People have friends, and for some people, that includes someone they dated. She's with me and not her ex because she wants to be with me and not her ex.	There are not many good reasons why you still need to be in contact with your ex. If she somehow has good reasons and informs me of them, fine. If she's been doing it behind my back, not fine.
What do women get that men don't?	A period. And occasionally sore boobs. (I refuse to believe that because my genitals are shaped differently from a man's, that I'm capable to "getting" something that he doesnt. Lack of understanding isn't a gender thing. It's a human thing)	I think kind of the burden of pregnancy? If women want a biological child, the only realistic option if you're not made of money is to grow it inside yourself and then either cut or push it out at great physical cost. It's definitely a stressful thing that looms in my future.
Do you like being called sweet? Why or why not?	All the compliments that works on women make me cringe and are not taken as compliments. Kind, sweet, cute, all I hear is "not manly" ie "not attractive." If kindness made the pussy drip our world would be a hippy fucking utopia, but the fact is the weekend warrior gets laid. It's a good way to know a girl isn't interested though. And from that gauge what sort of guy she likes. If you're a skinny guy called hot she likes skinny guys, if she calls you sweet and kind you can bet your non existent ass she likes muscular guys with a cheeky attitude.	*"Sweet? Where do you get off? Where do you get sweet? I am dark and mysterious, and pissed off! And I could be very dangerous to all of you! You should know that about me... I am the enemy!"*
What’s wrong with being called a nice guy?	Well, when I was a young man, nice guy meant what we now call the friend zone. You can’t be hot and nice at the same time.	Thanks to internet "nice guy" is considered to be a douchebag who acts nice and feels like they are entitled with getting into her panties just because they were nice to someone. So maybe they don't want to be associated with that kind of nice guy term.
Men of Reddit, have you ever been sexually harassed by a woman and what was your story?	I've been sexually harassed too many times to count, it's really not a big deal honestly. Girls will make comments or be grabby around me, it's no big deal.	Many times, I’ve been in bars, and had a random woman walk by me and pinch my ass as a way of initiating flirting. I could only imagine what would happen if roles were reversed.
If you have a bachelor's degree or higher: what did you major in and what do you do for a living right now?	BS in hospitality management from an average school. Graduated December 2012. Marketing Manager in the finance industry making $60k now.	I have a BA in English and am working on an MS in Project Management. I'm a technical writer for a military contractor. I write about tanks, basically. PEW PEW MURICA.
Have your siblings ever shared something with you that you really did not need or want to know?	My gay brother gave me WAY too much information about his relationship problems. I'm cool with the fact you're gay but don't ram it down my throat. Ahem.	Oh yes. My 25 year old brother tells me he wanks in the shower which is why he takes so long. My 26 year old brother announced at the Christmas dinner table that his fiancée has a large vagina.(He actually said it's like playing to an empty auditorium) My SIL told me and my Fiancé that she'd been fucked too hard and now she itches. Like, why do I/we need to know any of this?
What's your "I'm a grown man and I do what I want" guilty pleasure?	I was bragging to my buddy one night (who still lives at home with his mom, no car, no license, no real goals in life) and told him "ya know what's awesome about being a single adult? I can eat and entire fucking pie for dinner because fuck it" Proceeded to eat an entire pecan pie. Or like half of it, I think the whole pie was too much lol.	I bought a 12 pack of big league chew 'cuz I'm a man with a big boy job, dammit, and I'm gonna buy a shitload of bubble gum. That stuff was the tits when I was a kid. On "fuck it" nights I make an ungodly amount of mac and cheese, add extra cheese, then douse it in Sriracha. Apply copious amounts of whiskey to wash it down.
What are some things women who are not used to wearing a dress might overlook when wearing one?	I wore a dress to my cousin's wedding last year, and here's what I discovered: * Bending down sucks * Sitting down sucks * Getting up after sitting sucks * Taking long, speedwalking/running strides sucks The solution to all these stupid problems is to keep your legs fucking shut. all of the time. Also you can't bend your torso froward from your waist, depending on how short your dress is. So pretty much just imagine that your waist and upper legs are in an immovable cast and you can't move them. All so no one can see your underwear, yaaaay!	If you have a large bag or anything that rides against your side or back, make sure that your dress isn't riding up with it. So many times. Oh so many times.
What is a simple question you want to ask to the women from a certain country?	For American ladies: if I were to travel to the US on a vacation next summer, what are absolute do's and don'ts? Also, what cities are absolutely worth visiting in your opinion? Is accommodation cheap? I'm from the Netherlands by the way!	From the US, asking u/Redhaired103 and other Turkish AW posters: What is it actually like living in Erdogan's Turkey and what is the general popular sentiment? Every time I hear something coming out of there it sounds more and more 1984- purging intellectuals, imprisoning journalists, consolidating power, mass robocall recordings, blocking internet access... but my news is skewed towards sensational, negative things and apparently he still retains a lot of support? What is his base? (This may not be a simple question tho...sorry)
TV and movies always portray men as hopeless in bed and unable to satisfy women, have you ever had this problem or is it more of an invention of the media?	Second woman I've slept with was a little bit of a tight squeeze and I didn't do enough to get her warmed up, live and learn. Sixth woman I've slept with wouldn't get a clitoral orgasm unless she beat the shit out of the left side of her clit with a vibrator on it's highest setting, and when I would attempt to give her a g-spot orgasm she would repeatedly stop me because she felt like she needed to pee and wouldn't trust that I knew what I was doing (yay daddy issues). I got so frustrated I just started losing interest in sexing her up. Other than that it's been pretty smooth sailing.	Is that the case? I think it depends on genre. There is the sitcom stereotype of the "doofus husband" where they might allude to his inability to please her. But there are plenty of action movies where two people meet and have sex and look all orgasmic instantly.
How can you tell whether you're in love with someone or just in love with the idea of being in love?	I knew I was in love, when I wanted to marry this girl, but saw she was really happy with a different guy, so instead of trying to ruin their relationship, I was happy for her, and shoved away my pain, to see her happy.	You enjoy spending time with them now. You like their personality, characteristics and values as they are. You're not looking to change them or hoping some big gesture will magically improve everything. You're not forget waiting for the next step of commitment. I think in the most stable and healthy relationships, those big milestones are only affirmations of how you already feel and not an expectation of how you world feel.
Fit guys that used to be fat, how much did you weigh and how fast did you get fit? Also, what motivated you during the difficult times?	When I was 14 I was 5’3 and 180 lbs. I ran a lot and counted calories which got me down to 120 lbs in about 6 months. I stayed in the 120-130 lbs range for a couple years and then I started lifting weights a year ago and am at 150 lbs at about 15% body fat. So all in all, it took 6 months to lose weight and become skinny from fat. And then a year to recomp my body to look more muscular (but I’m not jacked or super strong by any means).	heaviest was 300 pounds 175 now took me a year and a half motivation illness I felt like shit all day and I was in pain all day I kept a photo of me at my heaviest as my wallpaper on my phone helped remind me of what I was and never wanted to be again
What are some of the biggest mistakes you think your male friends make regarding dating/relationships?	meanwhile I have more in common with my mom's 60 year old clients than any girl I've met my age (26). No girl I hang out with would ever want to go see the gallery of Winston Churchill's paintings, talk about Andrew Roberts, or visit the special exhibit on Prohibition	This isn't romantic, but my male housemate constantly complains about my female housemate being passive aggressive. Only to me. Never to my female housemate. He just silently resents her until it builds into rage. He somehow doesn't understand that him never ever complaining about things that bother him is not, in fact, her being passive aggressive; it's just her having no idea that he's ticked off because HE is passive aggressive.
For guys who use dating sites: which one has been most successful for you?	Okcupid, but it's not the app that's the problem here OP. if you aren't getting dates and matches, it's you. #toughlove	OKCupid, by a long shot. Partly because it's been around forever so I've been using it longer, but also because you actually have some room to express yourself. I pull people with personality better than pictures, so this works for me (back when OKC had individual journals, just a silly piece of writing a day got me tons of dates). I've met one girl off of Tinder, but we've been dating a few months.
To all homecooks, how do you create a weekly meal plan for the family and where do you keep all your recipes/meal ideas?	They're all saved in my bookmarks on Firefox. I find recipes that I can double or triple and only require a few things that I don't have on hand, and then I pick one bulk item and build all the recipes around it. For example buy 5lb chicken breasts and all recipes based on chicken, or buy a bag of rice and base everything around rice.	I usually plan a week ahead with about 3 meals planned out and the other days being flexible. Also, I have some back-up easy meals for days I don't feel like cooking, like pre-made pesto. Over the years I've accumulated a few go-to dishes and recipes that I rotate every week. Some are recipes from the internet, some from cookbooks, some are recipes that friends and family shared with me. I'm not too great with coming up with recipes myself. I've made copies of everything and put them in an Evernote notebook in case I feel the need to look them up again. Sometimes the blogs and websites get taken down, so it's good to have backup. A lot of meals share similar ingredients because of my personal taste, so I usually have most things at home already.
Do you ever feel like you're not "allowed" to talk negatively about feminism/women in general?	Wow, really? "I'm not allowed to express negativity towards people *without those people attacking my opinion*" That's amazing. Why on Earth would you *expect* people to "allow" you to talk negatively about them? *Of course* they're going to be bothered by it; of course they're going to tell you that you're an asshole and that you can fuck right off. Don't tell me you wouldn't do the exact same thing.	Even as a woman I feel like I can't state my own opinion if it goes against women or feminism. People get super offended when I state that I am not a feminist nor do I want to be. I think the feminist movement needs to be updated to the equalatarian movement and focus on all of the inequality in our society, not just mostly women's inequalities.
Sugar daddies, approximately how much money do you give for what in return?	I've been offered to be a sugar baby basically, and I lol'd. I had no idea what the set-up was supposed to be (I never did it) until I told people later. I value my time too much to everrrrr get involved in this shit. I do know this one girl I used to work with who does this though. She's my age (26), and hangs out with some 42 year old (who looks surprisingly young, I might add). She gets to go to courtside games with him, gets fancy dinners, he buys her designer shit, etc. She claims they don't sleep together, but she is probablyyyyyyy lying. I don't know - she says he just wants someone to talk to her, to accompany him, etc. I don't know if I buy it but it's not my place to judge.	7k to 10k base/month for the good looking ones. There's a subreddit for this stuff. I read it if I want to feel sad.
Does any other guy dislike or find it annoying when there S/O is extremely active on social media?	Because women want attention and validation. These social media sites give them the power they never had before. Publishing photos of them hanging out with their friends, going on vacation, getting expensive gifts, make them seem fun and appealing. Hundreds of likes and compliments make them feel wanted and celebrity like. This is one of the major reasons that females are as entitled as they are today.	I like social media. Hell, you're using social media right now. That said, there's a point where it's excessive, but I feel like it's less "are you on Facebook?" and more "Why are you fucking with your phone instead of interacting with me?" I couldn't care less what my wife does in terms of using social media, as long as I never take a back seat to it.
Ladies, how do you feel if you catch one of your male friends sneaking a peek at your goods?	It would annoy me. I have plenty of interactions with men in my life where I don't feel like I'm being sexualized all the time. So, why would I spend time with someone who would make me feel like a piece of meat? I mean, I get it, people find one another attractive. It's human nature. But there comes a time where I do expect the people I value in my life to put away childish boners and start seeing me like a real person. That constant and pervasive sexualization throughout the course of a friendship would bother me almost as much as if I had to interact with someone who called me a "girl" all the time.	I personally think it's completely normal. I have found that guys notice these things regardless of if they have interest in your or not. It doesn't offend me in the least. I think it's just a normal, natural part of life.
As a father, what should I not neglect to teach or do for my daughters?	"It's not a father's job to teach his daughter how to be a lady, it's his job to show her how a lady should be treated."	Do 'man stuff' with her. Are you repairing the door lock? Putting a bookcase together? Even things like replacing the shower head, get her to do it! You do not need a penis to use a screwdriver and own a toolkit.
What's your lame party trick?	I know the chorus to the Macarena, but I don't speak a word Spanish! It's one of my proudest accomplishments in life. I can blink/flutter my eyelashes unnaturally fast. Like, [Disney-fast.](https://youtu.be/hiptUShsnGs?t=1m22s) I can press my thumb against my underarm. Most of the time there's another person that can do this so it's not my best trick :( The back of my head is crazy flat. People only see it when they touch it because I got a lot of hair. Basically, I'm a freak of nature and get to exploit it at parties, huzzah.	I tell gross stories. I used to have a friend who could legit lick her elbow. We used to hustle people for stuff all the time back in the day betting on her. I would pick the mark and approach with the wager, then she'd do her act. We got a lot of stuff. CDs, posters, pens, a couple souls. It was fun
Who’s the worst guest you’ve had in your house and what did they do?	A guy who brought his Rottweiler, drank beer all the time and played his guitar way too much. The night before their 8 hour drive home I fed the dog canned chili.	This one is more humourous than anything, but I had houseguest who ate my entire birthday cake without asking, and then ALSO ate the replacement birthday cake that my friends/roommates bought out of pity for me not being able to eat my first cake.
What is your favorite standup available on Netflix?	Aziz Ansari. Almost everyone else is either a white guy making fun of women or minorities, or a woman or person of color making white people feel comfortable laughing at them.	If you're into strange humor and awkward delivery Eugene Mirman (voice of Gene from Bob's Burgers) has a standup out. Also, a lot of Bob's Burgers is on Netflix, if not all of it.
Who is a woman that you admire and why?	Oprah. In addition to her obvious massive success, I think she had a tough upbringing if I'm remembering the right wikipedia profile. More importantly, I find it fascinating that to this day, not everything she does is a success. Even Oprah makes duds. But she is wildly successful and popular because she doesn't let failure stop her from trying.	Shirley Curry. She's over 80 years old and has her own Youtube gaming channel. She got a lot of nasty comments when she first started out, but she dealt with it by being her own kind, wholesome self. Now she has a great fanbase that calls her "grandma", and she calls them "grandkids".
What do you think of Pokemon GO now that it has started to die down?	Same as I thought before: not my cup of tea, and becoming more annoying every day because of how people can't shut up about it.	Judging by the amount of lures around at all times here, and how quickly gyms change hands, I don't think it's dying down any time soon.
Happy (U.S.) gay marriage day! Lady-lovin-ladies, what would your ideal (and now legal!) same-sex wedding look like?	I'm currently with a man that I love, but I have the potential to love women as well. I can't wait to find my soulmate, whoever they are, and ~~obsessively control~~ have our wedding! Congratulations to all the women here who can finally realize their dreams! :)	Well, since the government is coming in to divorce me from my husband and force me to get gay-married, I might as well start taking advice from here and plan now. (/s)
How did you find out that your SO was cheating on you and how did you confront them? How did they react?	Late to this one but I had a high school girlfriend who not only cheated on me but after we were broken up I found an article she'd written online titled "How to cheat on your boyfriend and get away with it." I printed it out and gave it to her current boyfriend, with whom she had cheated while she was with me. He cried. Ten years later and I think they're married.	Met a girl in one of my drama classes in college. We became friends and she mentioned this guy she'd been seeing. I asked her about it. Turns out it was my boyfriend. She thought I was going to kick her ass, but like, why? It's not like she knew he had a girlfriend at all. She was as angry as I was. We went to his dorm room together and knocked on his door. His face when he opened it was fucking priceless.
What's something you can't tell your SO because it's better off they don't know?	That her friend has a dating profile. I know because I, too, have a dating profile and came across her friend's.	He uses far too many emojis. Don't get me wrong, I like using emojis but seriously majority of his texts are just emojis.
My friend is dying of cancer (he's in his 30s) and I've only got a few more weeks/months left with him... If you were facing this situation, how would you spend the time you have left with your friend? What would you do, think, buy, spend, give, etc. with the short amount of time left?	I wouldn’t. He’s dying. Nothings changing that. Dying is easy. He’s going to be in turmoil until he dies but then he won’t feel anything. You however are always going to miss him. You are always going to hurt If it were me I would start distancing myself immediately and pretend he’s not dying.	Ask him. Ask him what you can do for his wife and kids. Ask him what you can promise him that will ease his mind.
If guys are expected to never be vulnerable, then how can I make a guy feel safe about being vulnerable with me?	Just train him the same way you would a dog. Ask him about his feelings and when he tells you give him a blow job. After a month telling you about his feelings and being vulnerable suddenly won't be a no no.	From my experience, your little involuntary reactions will tell him if he can keep showing more emotion to you. So when he shows a tiny bit of upsetness or anger about an event if you react in the right way, he will keep opening up more with each time. If his emotion is met with awkwardness, a joke or indifference, he will store that information in his subconscious and no matter how many times you tell him "I am here for you" he won't open up with you. Edit: Thank you so much for the awards, all those kind words and so many upvotes. Really unexpected! And to all the guys who had a bad "reaction" experience, please give us more than one chance. Don't shut us out and show nothing on your face. Let us know with a subtle facial expression that you didn't like it.
What is your BIGGEST sexual insecurity?	My bedroom doesn't have a dimmer switch so it's impossible to get the lighting right unless I turn on the tv with the lights off. But I don't have a remote for my tv so it's awkward.	I read an article that said 5 inches was average penis size so I decided to break out the ruler. Worst mistake of my life.
Women who have been raped by women, how has your life been affected?	I'm a trans woman and I was assaulted by a young woman when I was 14. I saw a comment on here that talked about having trouble calling it rape and I struggle with that too because what I remember doesn't feel that bad but at the same time there are entire hours from that night I don't think I'll ever remember. The part that fucked me up the most is that, because I hadn't come out as a woman yet, everyone thought that the 14 year old "boy" must have initiated it and I got blamed for the sexual contact. My parents apologized on my behalf. I got grounded etc. The literal definition of blaming the victim. Still believe it was my fault. Oddly enough, I'm more scared of men than women so her gender hasn't really affected me that much.	I was molested by other girls my age when I was about 9. They undressed me on school grounds and took pictures of me with their phones. None of them were being molested (this was a group of about 15 girls), just did it out of pure hate because I was "the weird girl" and also had breasts when none of them had them yet. The same girls then made me strip and dance for them and molested me during a sleepover, then beat me up. I was kicked out of that sleepover *for being naked and beaten up*. It made me distrust girls my age for the longest time, especially girls with their same features for some reason.
Men: what compliment about your body would you like to receive from women?	Here is how women flirt with men: Look in his general direction for 3 continuous seconds. Then just sit back, he will do all the work from there.	Just be honest. Last thing I want is for someone to call me some muscular Adonis when I already know I'm not.
What should guys know about periods?	I might have an unpopular opinion, and I used to have *horrific* periods... But I don't think they're a fair excuse to be rude or overly emotional towards one's SO, and if a girl is using her period as an excuse to be an asshole to you, find someone else. Physically it can be very painful, so it can limit some women's ability to do things... Help if it's within your ability to do so... She will be very grateful! But really, it varies so much from woman to woman, you just have to figure out what is going on with the specific woman you're seeing.	Sometimes with a heavy period blood might get on the sheets. It's so embarrassing. If it ever happens to a girl with you just say it's no big deal and wash the sheets.
What's your most recent FAIL with the opposite sex?	In an episode of autism, I went up to a girl at the library and said "will you out with me"? I have no idea why	In a club on Halloween. See a girl. Smile at her, she smiles back. Do nothing. She goes away to the bar never to be seen again. Our babies would have been beautiful god dammit.
What's the dumbest thing you've ever done because of your crush?	I blushed when she was talking to me, with several of our mutual friends watching. We were 21/22. No one pointed it out but I doubt they didn't notice. Talk about looking like a needy/clingy wimp.	Well I dont have any stories myself, but the awkward rich kids at my school asked out this hot popular girl by giving her a diamond necklace. Turned him down and still kept the necklace.
Guys who want to eat healthy but are too lazy to cook, what's a quick and easy meal you make?	Sometimes a "meal" isn't what you need. Think about nutrients. Get a nutri bullet or blender. &#x200B; handful of Frozen bag of fruit. handful of greens (spinach, kale, arugala) cinnamon, protein powder. &#x200B; Your body will thank you.	Crock pots are a lifesaver. "Dump a bunch of stuff in a bucket and walk away" is the best way to cook. Stews, chili, I've been meaning to try a roast or something - they're versatile and pretty simple. Grilled chicken and broccoli's pretty easy too. Butter in a pan on medium heat, toss in a chicken breast, flip it after 7 minutes and cook for 7 more. Cut a bunch of broccoli, get a little steamer basket and a small pot. Boil an inch of water in the bottom, add the broccoli after you flip the chicken, take out the basket after you take the chicken out of the pan.
What was your most recent "I am not a smart man" moment?	My friend and I were unable to find a bunch of emails for the longest time. Turns out they'd ended up in the junk mail folder.	About to get into car. Notice scratch that wasn't there when I left it. Slightly raging. Follow scratches along the car to where they end, near the back lights. Rage intensifies. Ranting and swearing begins. Notice JD Sports bag in the back window of the car. Don't remember going to JD Sports. Don't remember my Peugeot having a VW badge. Turns out it isn't my car. See own car 2 spaces down. Such relief. Slink into it and drive away.
What traditionally "good" things have you been made fun of/bullied for?	Maybe I'm just jaded but I feel like this post is either an invitation to humblebrag, or OP wanted a post on which to humblebrag and it didn't exist yet. Anyway, in all seriousness, people have thought my boobs were fake and made fun of me for it but jokes on them bc they're not even big?	I grew up in a Japanese household and people used to make fun of me for eating weird food and raw fish because sushi was gross. Then sushi became a status symbol. Oh, how the tables have turned.
What was it that made you realize you were in a toxic relationship with your partner?	You could just take break it sounds corny but if it’s meant to be you guys could would be able to last after a break up you know like if it’s meant to be it’s meant to be but you never know you might just find someone that will treats you better	Any time we had to talk about a misunderstanding/disagreement/hurt feelings it escalated into a huge issue. He was so defensive and had to be the victim in any situation. Small things always turned into big ones
How can I date in a college town without being the "creepy older guy hitting on college girls"?	You're going to have to move to a new town. I'm 28 and at this point, I would feel uncomfortable dating 22 or 23-year-olds. It's only going to get worse. I visited Gainesville, Florida, earlier this year, and when I went out I felt like a complete creep even though I wasn't interested in hitting on anyone, I just felt like I was regarded that way because I was surrounded by 22-year-olds. I'm not even 30 yet. I wouldn't date below 24/25. When I'm 29 I think 24-year-olds will be too young for me.	If you don't go to student hangouts to pick up, it will solve 80% of this problem. The other 20% can be solved by asking early in the conversation what she does. If the answer is 'I'm a fresher/sophomore/junior/senior' then politely excuse yourself.
Men who have dated or married women with darker skin: what issues or judgement have you encountered, if any?	While I am hispanic, I very much look like a typical white guy. My wife is Asian, and younger than me, so I must have bought her on the Deep Web from a Dark Market as a slave from some whore breeding facility in Vietnam. something something rape culture toxic masculinity power positions shytlorde'.... My woman is more man than these judgmental witches will ever GET, and more woman than they'll ever BE.	Well, I'm a pale ass hombre, so even many White women are darker than I am, especially if they're capable of tanning. Had a black girl I was hooking up with shrink behind me and try to hide herself because she was paranoid about being stared at. That episode pretty much put the kibosh on going any further with her, because it was just too awkward and her behavior was actively drawing more attention, like we were somehow doing something wrong. I didn't feel judged, per se, and everyone around us was about as polite as to be expected given the circumstances, but I was concerned that she was going to make a scene or if someone was going to ask if she was alright and something untoward happening as a result.
Alrighty, what's the most depressing, single man meal you've made?	I don't understand what being single has to do with it, do coupled men still expect women to cook for them? What year is this?	I was too lazy to do the dishes so I took my box of cereal and gallon of milk. Took a handful of cereal, put it in my mouth, chugged milk. Ate the whole almost new box of cereal in one sitting.
What has been your most horrendous cooking disaster?	When I was in college, I went to Wawa for a chicken sandwich. By the time I got back, it was cold, so I decided to just pop it in the microwave. Unfortunately, I did not realize that the wrapper was made of a thin layer of foil between two pieces of paper. After a few seconds, my roommate started yelling, "FIRE!" I unplugged the microwave, ripped open the door, threw the only liquid I had in my dorm room on the sandwich - Crystal Light pink lemonade - and then slammed it shut so as not to set off the smoke detectors. My roommate and I then carried the microwave outside so that we could let out the smoke. Surprisingly, the sandwich was only burned on one tiny corner and the wrapper had protected it from the pink lemonade. It was delicious.	I was waiting and waiting for my pasta water to boil. Finally noticed I hadn't turned on the stove. So I turned it on. After waiting for an usually long time AGAIN, I lifted the lid to see what the problem could possibly be now. No water in the pot. That pot is fun colors of the rainbow now.
If you could ask every guy on a dating website 3 questions and the answers you got would be 100% true (they had to tell the truth under your magical powers), which 3 questions would you ask to find the right man for you....?

If a guy doesn't go in for a kiss after a first date (from shyness, indifference, etc) how do you interpret it?	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities. Not everyone here dates men. Everyone else, please feel free to respond based on the gender of partners you prefer.	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities.

For those of you who have paid for sex in the past, how did your current SO react when you told her?	You know, with the number of men on here who post that women should state their number of previous partners honestly in case it's a dealbreaker, I'm pretty appalled at everyone who is now saying "don't tell her you saw a hooker, she'll break up with you." Such hypocrisy.	Since a ton of you say not to tell her, what would you do if she explicitly asked after you two had become somewhat serious? "Hey I was wondering where you stand on prostitution? Have your ever paid for sex?" Do you lie? Tell the truth? Ask them if they really want to know? Refuse to answer the question?
I, 21M, was just sexually assaulted at a club for the first time and am furious. Can't believe you ladies deal with this constantly - how do you do it?	I'm a lady. I don't deal with this constantly. No, I'm not ugly. Just wanted to point out that not all women are harassed constantly.	The British TV station Channel 4 commissioned a small study for its *Dispatches* program in 1995. Of the 81 cases of male sexual victimization that they looked at -- 60 of which were penetrative rapes, and 21 sexual assaults of some other kind -- the *least* common response among male victims, at 17%, was physical resistance. 23% tried to talk their way out of the situation. 60% froze, reacting neither physically or verbally. It's almost the default response, for both sexes, in these kinds of situations.
People whose S/Os are considered very attractive, what are your best stories of them getting hit on around you?	A "friend" of mine kept talking up my husband at the gym. I felt it was bordering on emotional affair and I told him so. Stopped that shit immediately. Another time, this (different) "lady" (I like to curse and that's not allowed here I just figured out) tried talking to my husband for an extended period of time at a festival that *I* organized. Then proceeded to have my husband "help" her get her things into her car. My husband is mild mannered and doesn't seem to know how to "shut it down." It's very annoying.	My dad was *super* good looking as a young man. He was extremely popular with the women-6’4”, athlete, thick dark hair, clear blue eyes, and a true southern gentleman, too. My mom tells the story of a time when they went to an upscale restaurant for an anniversary dinner early in their marriage, and this woman nearby was staring and ogling. It continued until my dad looked deadpan right back into her eyes and picked a booger right out of his nose. So out of character for him and to my knowledge he has never done anything like that before or since.
Married ladies who got less sexual after marriage - what happened?	For us I think it stems from chronic pain issues for both of us, along with the stresses of daily life. It seems like the sun, moon, stars, and planets have to align perfectly for it to happen. We are trying to work on it because we are both sexual people, but the pain makes it difficult to do most basic tasks, let alone sex. I try to push myself to do it when he lets it be known hes good to go. It has really helped because yes I could use more sleep and yes I am tired. But if im not in pain and hes not in pain, and the kid is asleep im gonna try. Right now its once every 2-3 weeks. We both want it more and are actively working on it.	For me, it had more to do with his personality. There was more responsibility...planning the wedding, having a child, owning a home. Although made by mutual decisions, I solely had to shoulder the responsibilities. It made me resentful & how could I be intimate with someone that lied to me, constantly went back on his word. It really hardened my heart and completely turned me off to sex with him.
What compliment do you feel uncomfortable about or are tired of hearing?	Honestly? All of them that come from strangers/loose acquaintances. Nobody asked you and you're opinion is worthless to me, leave me alone.	You honestly can't even tell that you were bit by a dog!!! A bit of background, I was attacked by a dog a year ago, and the right side of my face was shredded and the left side of my nose was torn off completely. It's pretty safe to say, you can tell it happened. I know it, you know it, and I'm really sick of people saying I look the same. It would make it way easier to accept how I look now if people weren't constantly pointing out how bad it is by pretending it's not there at all
What’s the most important realization you’ve made about women?	I don't think they actually care about men, they've just reached a point where they act like the men they claim to hate.	I had this realization when I was a teenager and it served me well: there's no one thing women want. There are different things that different women want. As such, acting like someone else to get dates will only get you with women who want someone else. Instead, you just show who you really are, and the women who actually like that will reveal themselves to you over time.
Women in interracial relationships, what cultural things were your apprehensive about bringing into the relationship?	I'm Hispanic but my SO is white. It's a little different because I'm adopted and my parents are white so culturally we are similar (although I'm Canadian and he's British). Normally nothing bothers us, though when I was younger I was very susceptible to standards of beauty and I perceived myself as less pretty (to white guys)because I had darker skin. Otherwise just funny things, his sister's husband is Italian and everyone in his family was laughing about how dark their baby would be. Ha, wait til they see ours in a few years!	Is wrapping your hair cultural? I thought it was just about hair type and to a lesser extent hairstyle. I knew white ladies in my grandmother's generation who put their hair in a scarf before going to sleep.
How is your SO different from the “dream-girl/guy” you envisioned in your youth?	When I was younger I thought women actually enjoyed sex like in porn. Now I know they only have that much fun when they are getting paid.....	I always imagined some kind of bohemian, creative-type because that’s what I am (or was anyhow). My wife is actually a calendar-wielding, pencil-pushing square, but that balance of skills has made us an effective pair.
What's your favorite porn plot line?	Worst porn plot line I ever seen was one with a all male cast. Some reason there is a huge market for that type of thing. Edit this was a joke	I remember a cable guy one where a girl is sitting on a couch and you can literally see a hand come out from behind the other couch and unplug the cable. She says "damnit the cables out again!" Immediately there's a knock on the door and it's some buff dude I short shorts and a tool belt. They bang and at the end he gives her a facial and plugs the cable back in. She's sitting there still covered in jizz and says "I hope this covered the bill..." he looks at her says "sorry babe" and sticks the bill to her jizz covered face. Still cracks me up to this day.
On my days off of work I usually sit at home and don't do anything. I need hobbies. Where do I start?	Try magic the gathering. The community is great and be sure it will keep you busy. I suggest you install magic: duel to learn the rules, and the 12-13 January there are "prerelease" in stores that are small tournament specially for beginners. you can find the nearest one on the wizard locator. This is really a good moment to start it and meet people etc.	I joined a Hiking group. That became a sort of gateway to lots of other fun activities. Now I go snowboarding, snowshoeing, backpacking, climbing, kayaking, running. We also have all sorts of social, regular weekly happy hours, games nights, potlucks and group dinners.
Do the women you date seem to have a lot of problems?	> mountain of problems, whether it's severe medical issues, crippling self-image issues, fractured family relations, constant anxiety attacks, a history of sexual abuse, drug or alcohol problems, or any combination of the above. Most of that in my experience is made up bullshit, being a victim in the west these days is cool and easy, but really being a westerner and woman especially is easy mode.	You are the x factor. People with the kinds of problems you are describing have often lost the patience and sympathy of friends and family. They are quickly attracted to people that will listen to their problems, whether romantic or no. As a patient, good listener, these women are finding you. Were you a woman, guys like this would be finding you. You are catnip to folks that like to create and obsess over problems. You don't have to be rude or change who you are, but you should find ways to challenge people in conversations and make it clear you are not quick to believe the exact story you are hearing. This lowers your value to folks like this while keeping you just as nice and friendly to normal folks that think it's fair to be challenged.
When has a partner initially shown red flags, but actually turned out to be a decent person?	A note from your friendly neighborhood mod: If you're considering posting in this thread to say why something shouldn't be a red flag- please don't. It's invalidating of the person that you're responding to, derailing, and will be removed.

What would you think if your fiancée said she wanted to leave her engagement ring at home when she goes to a music festival without you?	Ask her how would you feel if once married you say you’re going out to party for a night and said you’ll be leaving your wedding ring, see what their response would be because no doubt it’ll be different when the shoes on the other foot. It’s fishy to me and a big red flag however, there are alternatives to wedding and engagement rings look em up.	I'd believe her. If she wanted to cheat, it's not like she can't just put it in her fucking pocket ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Ladies in interracial relationships, have you gotten any backlash from family/society in general?	White guy here, but married to an Asian woman. Been together 20 years and I can honestly say it has never even been mentioned, much less been an issue.	I'm a white woman married to an Arab man. Don't even get me started. "Does he make you cover up/cook/stay at home? Does his family accept you? So are you... muslim...? Are you allowed to do X?" My husband is an atheist. If my dad had still been alive he would have given me no end of shit for it. He was mega racist. Thankfully since he's dead that is not an issue and all my other family don't see it as an issue to bring up in the first place.
What's your experience with telling your girlfriend she needs to put more effort into the relationship?	I'm a guy, but if I heard it phrased that way I'd reconsider the relationship. If you're needy, fucking say it. We all have different needs when it comes to how much we want to interact with our partners. But if you need more attention, don't make it the other person's fault/problem. If you are needy, trying to make it come-off in a different way only kicks that can down the road, to be dealt with later when the relationship has got more serious.	In the past my SO has said things like "I don't feel like I'm a priority to you" and my response is "oh shit I've gotten lazy" and then I make more effort. I've had to have the same conversation with him. Not sure how long your relationship is, but it's fairly common to start to take your partner for granted without realizing it. Sometimes you need a nudge to get back on track. If she's emotionally mature, she should take it in stride. If she's not.....good luck.
What is the best most mind blowing comment that girl made towards you that made your think more of yourself?	Ex gf to other ex gf in my car "did you guys have amazing sex, because we did" saw other ex gf fb msgs, and she describes to her friend "spore2012 is amaaaaaazing in bed". So i got that going for me, which is nice.	When I was going through a divorce, my ex's brother's wife came over to me at a family function, "You're such a good man, she didn't deserve you." I said thank you and just as I was about to walk away, she goes, "Your kids are very lucky, I should've married you". I was taken aback a bit, I was speechless. Needless to say, that was about 10 yrs ago and now they're going through a divorce.
Men of Reddit, how often do you encounter a "starfish" in bed?	kinky? Lol...One thing ive learned is women LOVE to talk themselfs up..LOVE it..they love to say "oh i give the best blowjobs" or something Reality is..100% of the lays ive personally been with were star fish..hell i don't even think ive ever had a proper blowjob without the girl nearly biting my dick off. Foreplay? Lol...Yeah right.. its usually sex for 15 minutes or they complain > then they get off > goes to bed > blueballed and yet women love to cry "oh all guys do is care about themselfs!" Lol...Alrighty then	> It seems like 90% of women I've ever discussed sex with Women who starfish are unlikely to discuss sex a lot, while the reverse is most likely true for fairly kinky individuals. That might explain what you're experiencing (I'm sure there's a name for that... selection bias maybe?). I've luckily never had a real starfish (as in someone who really didn't do anything), but I've had very few partners who would put in as much physical effort and initiative as I did. The few that did really stand out head and shoulders above the rest in terms of how good the sex was.
what is the last book you have read and how much did you like it ?	The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I already knew the story after watching the movie starring Leonardo di Caprio, but I found the book to be underwhelming. Fitzgerald loves to throw together words that make no sense together. It’s like he tried to force a metaphor into every sentence. It’s amusing to read at times but kind of tiring to try to figure out what the heck he means. I enjoyed reading the book but I don’t understand why it’s so popular.	The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, I give it a 10/10. It had adventure, heart, and people proving their mettle. Strong women!
Girls, how much detail do you tell your girl friends about the guy after you've had sex with them?	This thread is terrifying. There are at least 2 people involved in sex. I feel like the other person should at least be consulted before private information about them is shared. They chose to share that part of themselves with you, not with your whole network.	I usually don't give details except to remark on the quality of the sex and my satisfaction with it. If something mindblowingly spectacular happened, I might be more graphic, but otherwise... not really. Also, I'm far more likely to tell detailed stories about my sexual experiences after they've ended, but even then, I might leave out specifics. "I once had sex with this guy that did [blank]..." I don't know. I rarely volunteer information just because, but a lot of my friends like to prod me for stories and advice, so I guess I share a lot more often than most other people in this thread are saying.
What is something that you will always regret for the rest of your life and always deter others from doing/getting into?	Several years ago, someone set off one of those supposedly silent dog repelling whistles. The sound of that thing invaded my bones, and I very nearly threw up. Sister said the same thing. That day I learned that your hearing starts to deteriorate around age 20. We googled why we were the only ones affected and no one else seemed to notice.	Staying in an abusive relationship. Also, completely sacrificing your friendships for a relationship, which goes hand-in-hand with abuse a lot of the time. Staying with a cheater and trying to work it out. Becoming FWBs with someone you still have feelings for. Quitting a hobby or passion you truly enjoy, especially if the reason for quitting is because your dead end job sucks the life out of you and leaves no energy for other things.
Who is the creepiest guy you encounter on a regular or recurring basis?	SUPER CREEPY DUDE ALWAYS AT MY JOB. Seriously, every time I go to the bathroom, there he is in the mirror staring at me...	There's this guy who's a regular at my place of work. I change my hair color a lot. He always asks my if my pubic hair is the same color. Fuck my life.
Women working in STEM, what is your occupation and how did you get there?	I'm currently halfway through a master's of urban planning and environment. It's contested as to whether it is a stem field because it falls under the umbrella of social sciences, but we work in areas such as geography, cartography, GIS, economics, demography, statistics, and with engineers. Some people consider it stem, others don't. It's sort of in the middle of it all I guess. It's a very all encompassing field depending on what you specialise in. Edit: NSF says we are STEM Wooooooo!	I'm a graduate student in Logic, Computation, and Methodology! I was given my own computer at the age of eight and I learned HTML and CSS. Then I started working at fourteen doing web development for real estate companies all over the US. I used this money to switch to private school. In college I changed my major every week freshman year before deciding to make my own. I had to petition an academic board and work closely with faculty to design my major, but it was approved! I graduated in May, and now I'm at Carnegie Mellon concentrating on modal logic to diagram technical systems. :D
I'm getting a bit tired of consuming media about female sexuality that's written by men. What are some good books or movies by women that address this topic?	She gets a lot of flack for being hypocritical, but I really liked Lena Dunham's autobio Not That Kind of Girl. I think it really resonates with 20/30-somethings.	Actually, *Blue is the Warmest Color* is based on a graphic novel written by a lesbian woman. Julie Maroh is her name, and she has written a piece about how after selling the rights to her novel the director failed to invite her to the set, to any premiers and award shows, refused to answer her emails and basically gave her no thanks other than adding her name onto the credits. She also talks about how she felt like the lesbian sex scenes failed to depict how lesbian sex actually is, and that they were too pornographic and made to fit the male gaze. For books I always liked Alice Munro's *Lives of Girls and Women*, as well as Louise Rennison's *Georgia Nicholson* series.
How often do you buy a new pair of shoes?	About once a year. My sneakers last ~2 years. My running shoes last maybe half a year. My boots get resoled every 2-3 years. My daily wear is either the sneakers or boots depending on weather.	Running shoes, every 3-6 months. Dress shoes, perhaps every 2-3 years? Casual shoes... maybe every 1-2 years. Only my running shoes get significant wear.
Do any of you go through times where it feels like every girl wants you then times where it feels like no girll wants you?	Sure. Women put it on a platter for me now that I'm married. When I was single, much less so.	Not *every* girl, but there are times when I feel like I'm actually getting attention from women, and times when I'm just like an object in the background to them. Weirdly enough, the amount of attention I get seems to be inversely proportionate to the level of motivation and direction that I have in life.
Potentially [NSFW] What has your partner said or done that has absolutely GOBSMACKED you?	What the fuck is "gobsmacked"? Actually today my girl and I were in the middle of a movie, and out of *nowhere* she blurts out "Do you think I'm ugly?" in a serious tone. The real issue is that this is becoming a pattern with her despite the fact I tell her every damn day she is beautiful to me.	I had a gf in college who..while giving me head stopped and said "i want to watch you take a shit". I didn't have one on deck for her at the time..and i was a bit put off.. Never did shit infront of her tho.
If you consider your intelligence below average, how has being less intelligent than most people affected your life? How do you deal with it? How do you feel about it?	I'm a cognitive psychologist by trade. I can tell you with 100% certainty, based on your diction and syntax in this thread, you are not as dumb as you think you are. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome	It's telling how everyone in this thread is trying to convince you that you're not dumb without any information. I mean half the population has to be below average. It's not the end of the world.
How many of you have a female best friend and how has it affected your relationships?	I do. My girlfriend has a problem with it in that she's very flirty, touch/handsy, and doesn't know her well. Edit: just saw your little note. We have in the past. Girlfriend doesn't know the extent, but the way she touches me is enough to not sit well with her.	Yup, she's my go-to confidant for a lot of the stuff that happens to me, and we share a lot of common interests. And nope, never fooled around. She's a friend first, basically just one of the guys, not to mention I'm really close to her husband too. I've only been in one real relationship while we've been close. And that girlfriend didn't seem to care at all.
What is the best example of irony that you’ve seen or experienced in real life?	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.	My mother was a council member in my town growing up, and there was an insane (not pejorative; literal) couple who stalked her and acted like she was responsible for every evil in the world. One day, the town council voted on a sign ban. My mom voted against it. For weeks after that, the couple drove around with a huge sign on their car that said "[My mom] wants to pollute [the town] with signs."
What is the cruelest thing you've ever done?	I slept with a married man multiple times over the span of two months. I know his wife. She is a friend of a friend and we have all been invited to the same dinner parties. I once had sex with her husband in the bathroom while dessert was being served.	I was fighting with my dad and told him that I wish he died instead of my mom. I still feel terribly about that and it's been over 10 years.
What do you think of this idea that there are "no truly straight women"?	The phrase and idea behind it is super gross. There are plenty of people who have zero attraction to members of their own sex. Sexuality might be a spectrum, but that still means there are people on either end (truly gay and truly straight). *That said,* I'm of the opinion FAR more people (both men and women) are slightly bisexual than what people believe. Generally, I think this is the case because people who prefer the opposite gender would say they're straight even if they occasionally had sexual attraction towards their own gender (which I would consider bisexuality or pansexuality). I feel like the phrase "no truly straight women" exists because women are more likely to admit to feelings of attraction towards their own sex (even if they say they're straight) whereas men have been socially conditioned to avoid that.	It's wishful thinking. I've never had a single urge to do anything sexual with another woman. But people who claim there are "no truly straight women" will argue against that and say I don't know my own feelings or something like that, and it's hard to counter those kind of arguments because it will always come back to "but you don't know your own feelings, you're repressed" or something silly like that. Like a stranger would somehow know me better than I know myself.
You just won $1B. What's the most badass way you can quit your job you can think?	I don't have a job as I'm still in school and haven't invested in any part-time vacancies... but even so. (*This is probably going to sound wayyyyy over-the top haha!*) If this happened to me in the future, I'd crash a window in the building, then call for a helicopter to fly in line with the floor level. I'd then call for my boss, who'd hopefully have his jaw strung open like a cat watching a mysterious ball of fluff floating in the air, and throw him my resignation papers, shaking his hand. Then, I'd do an eagle call and jump through the window into the helicopter as it flies off, with a boombox blasting some gangsta-ass music. I'm such a DAYDREAMING loon. :D	I clean at my dad's business. I would give him a couple million dollars so that he can retire I suppose, making me redundant
What is your go-to method to approach women you don't know?	I just make eye contact with them and smile, they usually come and say hi, if they look away then I leave them be.	"Hey... could I... Um..." *stare at your shoes* "I mean, how are... um... what is... um... never mind." *walk away.*
My boyfriend is a groomsmen and the groom has chosen a suit that is $500. Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous?	Really you have no say in how he spends his money. $500 sounds about right for a decent suit. You can very easily spend upwards of that on a good suit. Not only that but a good tailored suit can make a man feel like a million bucks.	$500 is not that much for a decent suit. Can he not rent it out for a week or so?
Ask men, where do you think women fail the most in relationships?	In my personal experience and from observing my friends and acquaintances: * Think the relationship is entirely about them * Not willing to put effort into the relationship * Staying with someone who is a lost cause	Communicating and understanding insecurities. Relating that information in a calm way to your partner, and then working together to resolve them. I think men fail at this too.
What is the biggest age gap in a relationship that you know of and how are the couple now?	Biggest age gap was with me (F18) and my ex (M42). He was abusive and incredibly controlling. Broke up in four months. Currently with a 32 year old. Going on seven months, he's immature but stable. I'm mature but anxious/depressed. Works for us.	My cousin is 28 and his girlfriend is 61. They met while he was bartending, she owned the bar and was a widow. They have been dating 4 years it's really awkward at family get together and social gatherings. He is a two time felon and I am constantly wondering how awesome the ending of this relationship will be.
What can I tell a guy to make him feel all warm and fuzzy?	Acutally just text him that: "I want to send this guy I'm dating a text that'll put a smile on his face and make him feel all warm and fuzzy." He'll melt like butter, I guarantee.	Text him that he makes you feel warm and fuzzy. Then 30 seconds later follow up with "and wet. Warm, fuzzy and wet." That should do it.
What is weirdest or creepiest phone call you ever received?	I was babysitting for a friend and their house was a bit remote. Usually a friend of mine and I would babysit together as he was the one that introduced me to this friend. This time I was alone. I got a phone call where all I could hear was the tv I the living room. The living room of the house I was in. I have never been so freaked out. I never babysat at their place alone again.	I got one from an unknown number describing everything I was doing at the time. I'd like to think it was one of my friends messing with me, but I didn't recognize the voice, and no one fessed up.
Women of askwomen, is there a female equivalent of a guy with a neckbeard/fedora?	The pin-up hair and cat-eye glasses combo, I think. [Google search result for "pin-up hair and cat eye glasses" so you know what I mean.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f4/89/94/f4899405bb24f7b30e0e272c5a4bb105.jpg).	There appears to be a reciprocal relationship between "nice guys" who complain about getting "friend zoned" versus girls who complain about never being more than a fuck buddy. The nice guy does all the nice relationshipy stuff and thinks it will lead to sex and the girl does all the sexual stuff and thinks it will lead to a relationship.
What do you do to make yourself feel alert getting out of bed early, instead of dragging ass and hating your life for the first 30 minutes?	Set one alarm for when you need to get up and one alarm for 30 minutes earlier. Leave a glass of water and a caffeine pill on your night stand when you go to sleep at night so when the first alarm goes off, even in your groggy state, you can pop the caffeine and take a few sips of water. Go back to sleep for 30 more minutes. When your real alarm goes off, the caffeine will have had time to get into your system. You'll wake up ready to go and like you've just had two cups of coffee. Because you basically drank two cups of coffee while you were sleeping.	If you wake up 45 minutes before your alarm or less, stay up, start your day, you'll feel pretty good. Whenever I try to fall back asleep for those extra minutes, I end up feeling like hell.
What weird things do you do with your pets?	So one of my dogs is named Minnie. We sing the Biggie Smalls song to her but change the words - “Minnie, Minnie, Minnie can’t you see? Sometimes your snugs just hypnotize me. I just love your Minnie ways. Guess that’s why they’re broke and you’re MIN-AY. “	My cat stares out the front window, so I wave to him whenever I leave for work or the gym or whatever.
What's the "smallest" you guys have ever felt?	I am a female but going to provide my thoughts on this... Going to therapy makes you the manliest of men. It takes some real courage to show up as you are and tackle things head on with a therapist. It shows how you value and love yourself so much that you are committed to seeking a life of inner peace and happiness. That makes you a "big" deal and not "small" in a lot of people's eyes. You are doing so great and I wish you well! Ps. Dont ever let people make you feel bad for feeling the way you feel about your issue. You have the right to feel the way you do and you are taking steps to be in a better place. That's already more than what a lot of people could muster.	When the police pulled up as I was being held down and punched repeatedly in the driveway. Bloody, hysterically crying I thought I was now safe. Instead I was instantly forced to the ground and handcuffed and arrested. Even videos of being attacked didnt matter, police literally said we dont care who did what. After a couple hours I bailed myself out. Long story short all charges against me were dropped even before trial, and I got an apology. What I also got was the knowledge that spousal abuse is a one way street. "Shut up and take it you're a man, You'll get arrested instantly if you call, There is no such thing as a female abuser". Really sucks sometimes.
What's the silliest thing your SO has gotten mad at you for?	well, I once got mad at my bf because he didn't let me do a full makeup face on him. I just wanted to see how he would look like with makeup on and he didn't even let me put on lipstick! It was like he didn't wanted to make this little sacrifice for me Asshole	Ex wife would get mad at me for working out without her. If she didn't feel like going to the gym, or getting out of bed early to go run when it's cool outside, she would be upset if I did it without her. Basically she couldn't stand me improving myself if she wasn't too, like she was falling behind or something. She was a huge narcissist.
Do you hide your attraction for women? Why?	No, not unless there is a very good reason to hide them (say, your girlfriend is extremely jealous or the person you're attracted to is your boss). I think being attracted to somebody is a wonderful feeling. I don't hide attraction but I also don't have to force myself upon a woman. Nature made it so I can't help but look at women I am attracted to and they will eventually notice. I try not to be creepy or freak them out. I just enjoy in silence. Any female friends I am attracted to, I will tell so in the right moment (when I know that she won't take it the wrong way). That doesn't mean I am actively trying to get into their pants. It just means that in a different world, if they wanted it too, we might actually explore it.	Always, I honestly have no idea how I'm even supposed to show my attraction to someone in a way that's not creepy or awkward.
Do women check out men?	Excuse me for commenting in the subreddit, but may I suggest that you start lifting weights and dieting. If you're dedicated by this time next year you will be getting checked out and likely *asked out*. Source: Personal experience. Again, sorry for not being a woman and commenting!	Oh I do it ALL the time. I love looking at men. I just don't make it obvious like you guys do. Question for you: would you *like* for a girl to make it obvious? Edit: the men have spoken! I've decided to make it more obvious when I check guys out. I'll try not to be creepy. ;)
What are some boundaries you have in place in your relationships (romantic or otherwise), and how do you enforce them?	I don't really know where to start, I have boundaries in all of my relationships. I "enforce" them (strong word) by not allowing/engaging in behaviour that crosses my boundaries. I know that sounds really vague but I'm not totally sure where to go without being really specific.	Sex is for mutual pleasure. I will not be harmed for someone else's pleasure. And if we're going to test limits, reciprocity is expected.
What do you think about men having "legal abortion" rights regarding unborn child, that are beind debated about in Sweden?	You mean, legalizing being a deadbeat? No. By the time you know what to do with your dick, you know what can happen when you use it. Grow the fuck up. Bad karma to Sweden for being stupid.	I suppose it would work the best in Sweden, but in most countries (even western developed countries) single mothers are still more likely to face financial hardship and children in poverty is still a social issue. So in order for this to work there needs to be 1. a tight knit social safety net, 2. remove not only legal but also social barriers to abortion, and 3. no stigma against single unmarried mothers.
With which signs can you tell that someone has almost never been alone in their life?	The belief that you can just go out and "grab a girlfriend". Most often said from female friends who literally think that's the way it's done. Often followed by "No, you're cute! What me? Um, maybe if I wasn't dating (name changes weekly)"	"hey, what's for dinner?" I dunno dude, whatever you want to make for your damn self, I'm your roommate, not your mom.
Vegans, vegetarians, and women who don't eat very much meat, could you describe your average week in meals?	I rarely eat breakfast which isn't a good thing. Lunch is a sandwich, wrap or sushi if I'm out and about. Dinner is some variation of chicken, salad and veges 95% of the time.	This week is pretty representative for me -- Breakfast: overnight oats, coffee Lunch: alternating between black bean soup and tofu/veg stir fry Dinner: will be different each day but probably salad, pasta with veggies or veggie burgers. Snacks: babybels, apples and PB, other fruits
Ladies of Reddit who’ve cut off your (ex) best friend, what happened and how long did it take you to get over it?	She slept with my ex boyfriend when I wasn't over him and I cut both out of my life. I can say hi now and hold a small talk conversation when running into either one.	Wasn't my best friend but she was definitely very close to me. It took about 8 hours of her holding me hostage in her house, saying that I had been drugging her water, food, tapping her phone, that I was a clone and she was going to abduct my son and find the real me, for me to cut her off. It took me about a week to get over it, and now I don't miss her at all. The week that it took me to get over her was more fear of her coming and breaking into my house in the middle of the night.
What is the cutest thing that your SO has done for you and make you still smile when remembering it?	We just started dating and I texted him that I was going to the bathroom to poop. He said he had to poop, too but he was gunna wait til he left work. I said it would have been cool if we were “poop twins”. 3 minutes later he sent me a picture of the stall he was in. I know it’s a weird but it made me feel special :’-)	We had been married a few years and I went back to work after having our first baby. We were working opposite shifts because we didn’t have daycare and barely saw each other. I went to work at 5am and it was rough. But almost every day there would be something in my car for me. A pack of gum, a candy bar, post it with a little note, a flower. Just tiny little things that don’t mean a lot in general. But it also meant he was stopping at the store on the way home from work at 1am after working 12 hours just for me.
I'm a 16 year old and I'm quite clueless on condoms. What do I need to know?	All you need to know is that sex feels much better without one, and if an abortion is out of your budget a hot tub and a trip down the stairs is a good alternative, and don't worry about STDs as long as you use hand sanitizer as lube you should be fine	The short version is that if you're going to have sex, you should wear a condom, and if your condoms are expired, you should buy new ones. As for sizing and comfort issues, all I would say is if you're not happy with how one brand or type works for you, try a different one in the future.
Does your family make up words for things? What are they?	Bickens for our bickens. My sister had actually greeted me "hey how's your bicks". It didn't hit me until later that she asked me how my vulva was doing.	You know how cats get that hangy belly that flaps back and forth when they run? My cousins call it a "sack of woo". And when cats get scared and do that sideways jump thing? That's "chinky chinky". No idea where they came up with those. Edit: I love all theses cat belly names. Hilarious!
She's otherwise the perfect woman, and she cares about you.. but she's heavily overweight. What are your reactions?	How is she going to take care of my needs and my children if she can't even take care of herself. Sound far from perfect to me	Sounds like we'd be great friends. It's not fair to anyone if I enter into a relationship with someone I'm not attracted to. Eventually, one of three things would happen: - She'd lose the weight, opening the way for a relationship. - My attraction would grow to the point that I stopped caring as much about the weight. - We'd move on.
Ladies, what's your greatest Liz Lemon moment?	When I worked a terrible stressful job with ridiculous overtime I once came home, got into a bath, and ate hummus.	I had a guy ask me, in the course of a conversation, if I was single. My response was to rant about how I didn't need a man and people need to get off my ass for being single. He was trying to ask me out.
What are your secret or unpopular opinions on parenthood?	I approve of spanking a child. I was spanked as a child and I was one of those kids that you could have done anything under the sun else but the only thing that got me to listen was to apply pain when I did something my mom really didn't want. I don't view it as abuse and while I don't mind people who don't want to spank their children, it infuriates me when they try to shove their opinion down my throat saying I"m a bad person for seeing it as okay. You don't see me over here telling you that your kid acts like an entitled hellion because you refuse to discipline them, so do me a favor and unless actual abuse is occurring, butt out.	I wish there were more resources for prospective parents to find out if parenthood is really for them. I didn't want kids for years and everyone was like, "oh, you'll grow out of that." 25 years later, I have two daughters whom I ADORE, but the secret, honest truth is that I don't love parenting at ALL. I seriously just typed and erased that last sentence three times. Even on an anonymous forum, it is terrifying to admit. Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! And to everyone for making me feel not so alone.
What's the worst description, euphemism, or phrase you've come across while reading erotica?	You lovelies so need to read a novella called Belinda Blinked. It's available on Amazon and is beyond hilarious! The descriptions are amazing, with poor Belinda having her ovaries punched by manly tumescence and suchlike! It's so funny that I can't recommend it highly enough for cheer up factor!	Uh, this is actually one of my own, from my old fanfiction days. My guildies used to tease me relentlessly for it, hopefully it fits the spirit of the thread: *"I want to fuck you," Leon hissed in Ashley's ear, and her moan seemed to get caught in her throat, a sweet dolphin of pleasure, trapped in the tuna nets of Leon's seduction.* Yeah. The tuna nets of seduction...
My cat likes to steal my make up brushes and play with them. What does your cat do that pisses you off?	My cat morphed into a dog so I'm totally happy now! He doesn't do anything wrong 98% of the time.	She yowls all night long. If she can get into the bathtub, that's her favorite spot to do it because of the acoustics. It's like she's trying out for American Idol.
All male house, roommates girlfriend is moving in with us,. How can we make her more comfortable?	The best way to make *me* comfortable in that situation is just to act normal. If someone treated me differently than the guys in the house I'd be bummed out because it would make me feel inferior (and yes, it includes behaviors like putting me on a pedestal--different treatment is always bad).	Put a trashcan in the bathroom if there isn't one there already. Otherwise, basic good roommate stuff. Do your dishes, clean the stove after you cook, empty the dish drainer.
What's the most egregious misunderstanding of the female body you've ever encountered?	A female friend thought the Pill worked by basically clogging up all the period blood in your uterus. She said "Isn't it dirty?". She also said a doctor told her that...	White discharge stain in underwear = other men's semen Or that fucking 100 guys once will make your vagina loose, but fucking the same guy 100 times won't.
What relationship quote do you hate the most?	“Maybe it was the right person, but the wrong time.” No. If it was the right person, you’d make the effort to be with each other.	"Love will keep us together." No it won't - you need commitment, shared values, sacrifice, loyalty, so much more than just love.
What is the most sheltered thing you heard from someone?	This woman was telling me about how she had to pay a huge amount of cash for her Brother's wedding and that she doesn't even like his wife. I said "its like life just likes to turn you over and fuck you in the ass." She said she doesn't even like to get fucked in the ass.	I gave a friend a ride to this local shopping centre and she asked if she could leave her bag in my car. I said sure put it in the back. She asked why she couldn't just leave it on the passenger seat. I was confused but explained it might make the car a target for theft and she was like, "but... How can someone get into a locked car?" Like she seriously had no idea that breaking into a car was a thing or that people might steal things out of cars.
Do you ever have days where you're just feeling toxic and mean, and you just want to cuss out anybody who has been bothering you that week?	No. Gee, I really am an oddball, I guess. I never have a desire to be toxic or mean to anyone. Even if they have done something wrong to me, I feel guilt over having feelings of hate towards them. I think that might just come from me being an unconfident person, though. Edit: Aaaand of course I get downvoted for having an unpopular experience (and saying that I'm NICE to people!), surprise surprise	Yup, for sure. I tend to bottle my emotions and ignore them so sometimes, when things get a bit too much, they threaten to bubble over. If I know I'm being unreasonable and don't want to actually raise the issue, I'd journal. I'd write letters to express my annoyance and just cuss as much as I want to (or don't) on those letters. I've never sent these letters and would never, ever would because they're petty as hell, but it usually helps.
Redditors who have completely start over in their late 30's, what did you do? How has your life changed?	What does this question even mean? Start over? You don’t start life over, you begin new chapters. This is exactly what is wrong with society & never being satisfied. Self love and acceptance is vitally important in life..don’t think in terms of being late to the party or missing an opportunity. It’s all about growth and self acceptance. Namaste.	I waited until I was 41 to flip the table. I left my 19 year marriage and started over in a new town where I had just a few friends. Lived there during the divorce process, but never really found my feet, and ended up moving to ANOTHER new town in response to a job offer. That was a place where I knew no one, and moved with just a tiny trailer load of stuff. That was 8 years ago. I've had to learn how to date as an adult, establish a career from scratch, make friends, collect enough stuff to fill an apartment, and figure out who I am as a single person. And I've done pretty well, honestly. My life now is a good one.

What is the one book you would recommend to a young man just starting out?	Atlas Shrugged, What's the Matter with Kansas, Guns Germs and Steel, The God Delusion, Liberalism is a Mental Disorder, and a bunch of other idealistic crap	Models by Mark Manson. It gives you a good overview about how to live and prioritize your life, and he'll suggest reading more books too :)
How would you feel if a woman gave you flowers ?	>I’m a girl and I always wanted to ask a guy out on a date and give home roses. Why? I would certainly appreciate the gesture, and sincerely thank you. When get home I'll probably throw them in the garbage. What else am I supposed to do with them?	I'm not a flower guy but I'm a sucker for gestures like that. The first time my wife got them for me (we had been dating for a while at the time) she brought them to my work, I was a mechanic and I was all greasy and oily absolutely cheesing walking back into the shop. The guys gave me shit but I loved it.
What's an unconventional occupation that you're secretly interested in trying?	Male stripper. I want to slap women in the face with my cock that is covered in whipped cream and get them to blow me while I make tips. It's not even about the money. Or a CIA field agent/hitman/cleaner etc.	Being a PI. I just want to be a moody alcoholic who follows people around all day. Or a crime scene photographer.
What are the top ten things you look for in a man?	My boyfriend is my ideal man. Tall Skinny Smart Red hair Ambitious Hardworking My family likes him Likes/wants kids Similar interests Kind	1. Likes copious amounts of physical affection. 2. Is unafraid to have new experiences in food and environment. 3. Laughs a lot. 4. Can take a ribbing. 5. Can give a ribbing while not taking it too far. 6. Is kind and caring even to strangers. 7. Shares about half of my interests, but no more. 8. Is curious about the world around them. 9. Can hold conversations about world processes and is willing to admit what they don't know. 10. Can hold mature arguments without getting dirty or crazy.
Women in inter-religious marriage, what are the pros and cons of being from different religions and how you handle sensitive topics which can potentially cause conflict?	I’m an eclectic witch who practices Hoodoo as well. Fiancé is new age satanist. Not really any problem to be honest, we let each other do our thing or ask questions. As far as how to raise children, you allow them to explore, but neither of us would force religion, or just doesn’t sit well with me.	Entirely dependent on the religion and how active you are in it and how important its beliefs are to you. For example, if your religion says you need to baptize your kids as infants or they go to hell and you believe that (this is just an example) but your spouse refuses to let his/her kids be baptized in that religion, then that could cause a major conflict. For me, it ultimately didn't work out.
Bill Gates can leap over a chair from a standing position. Can you?	Used to be able to, then I took an arrow to the knee. Spend a couple years doing heavy squats and deadlifts 3x a week and you can, too.	>Q: "Is it true that you can leap over a chair from standing position?" >A: "It depends on the size of the chair." Spoken like a true engineer!
It’s often said that when men wear a wedding ring they get more attention from women. Do you think they are actually flirting or perhaps they now consider you “safe” and can be friendly/friends without worrying about being hit on themselves?	Whenever im single girls barely come. Whenever i get a girl multiple hot girls r into me. Must be a test. Maybe she setting me up ?? Hahaha	As a young married dude it’s both, being married (generally) makes you feel much safer so they can let their guard down more and also makes you seem more desirable. Also, personally, I am way more confident when talking to women since getting married because there’s not the same pressure/need to impress.
What is it about your current SO that makes them so different than others you’ve been involved with?	We share the same height even though I am not short, she is much more socially extrovert and outgoing than me (has 700 facebook friends while I have 70) and mildly socially dominates me (without arrangement or consent, ordering me not to watch porn sometimes or we won't have sex). I wouldn't say she is a mother figure to me but more like I am very very young so my rich parents paid professional female tutor for me to help me through life.	My past girlfriends, no offense to them, have been kinda dumb. It was always frustrating as hell when they would get mad at me over some little thing and there was no rationalizing with them. My current SO on the other hand is really intelligent. It's amazing what she can come up with. She always has insightful opinions on things. We get along great because we can both voice our thoughts well. It feels like more of a partnership than some sort of competition. She's pretty great.
How do you guys deal with having an existential crisis?	Start smoking weed and going to the gym. Find a butthole or a vagina to smash. If that butthole or vagina is attached to a person you like being around, do stuff with them My zen garden is complacence.	Try reading *A Confession* by Tolstoy. He details his nightmarish experiences with these same questions until eventually he found a way to continue living in spite of them. Many of us feel 'different' to others when we first begin questioning life in this way (as if most others simply don't understand or something), however these questions have been posed throughout history and will continue to be posed until we somehow encounter transcendent answers. Personally I've felt the same way as you for the past couple of years. My respite has been through obsessively reading various works of philosophy which has led me to some fulfulling conclusions. People like Seneca, Schopenhauer, Dostoyevsky, William James, Camus, Alan Watts etc. have helped me begin to understand the astounding depth to these sorts of questions. You are not alone, nor are you insane.
What strange behavior does your best friend do that you can't understand but you have to let slide?	She will spend $1200 to purchase a really ugly dog from a breeder when there are hundreds of dogs that need a home locally. They’re stuck in cages and die from illnesses at the shelter or have to be put down because of over crowding. But she spends the equivalent of my house payment just to buy a dog when I foster kittens so she’s heard all kinds of horror stories from me. :/	Stands too close to people in a line. Like, breathing down their neck close. People usually get uncomfortable and give her looks; she is oblivious. Doesn't understand what the big deal is. Edit: we are Indian, so yeah, the concept of personal space is a bit wonky. But I wouldn't stand within 2-3 ft of another person, personally.
Toilet paper that doesn't leave "souvenirs"?	I use cloth for pee. That sounds weird to most people (and it did to me too before I tried it), but now I LOVE it. I cut up a pair of old flannel sheets into little squares, I use the square, then I toss it in the laundry.	Honestly I find that cheap toilet paper is the best for this. As shitty as the stuff is in public stalls, it never gives me clitty litter. Edit: something something can't believe I got gilded for a comment about toilet paper. Thanks, /u/lordvadr!
I just went on a shitty date, what's the worst date you've been on guys?	She was probably really nervous. Being overweight and "weird" it might have also given her a confidence boost to finally get a date. Men can be pretty cruel and have such high standards. Don't be bland. Don't be too weird. Don't talk too little. Don't talk too much. Voice your concerns. Don't complain. Be yourself. Shut up, already. Weight doesn't matter. Why are you fatter than your pic? Anyway, she sounded weird and annoying, regardkess. But you also seem a bit shallow since you are only looking for fwb and won't outright say it.	Went on a date with a girl I had been acquainted with through a bar I frequented on Fridays. We met for drinks and hung out, then some of her friends showed up randomly... She says its just coincidence, and they seem cool so we all start hanging out. She proceeds to get wasted, and starts a bar fight with some dudebro. Have to physically restrain her and get her out before the cops show up. Didn't go on another date, and reamed her out the next day. She stopped coming by the bar... I think she was embarrassed.
Can I see your engagement rings?	I'm not engaged yet but I absolutely fell in love with this [ring set](https://www.etsy.com/listing/474851021/celtic-wedding-set-platinum-diamond). I don't want a diamond in the center, probably a pale blu or green stone but this ring is everything I've wanted in an engagement ring and I've been dropping heavy hints to my SO that this is the one I want.	[my engagement ring](https://imgur.com/a/NhwNB) [wedding band I want to pair with my engagement ring](https://imgur.com/a/66DwQ) The diamond is from my mom's engagement ring. My dad passed away eight years ago, so she gave me her engagement ring. My fiancé had the diamond reset in a gold band (my request), which fits my style well. I wanted a solitaire ring and more ornate wedding band. As soon as I saw the pic of that wedding set (above) I knew that was exactly what I wanted.
Women with anxiety, how do you deal with chronic worry, when your mind is fixated on one certain thing that you can’t stop overthinking/worrying about?	Unpopular opinion but...Honestly I hate posts like this. Filled with people saying "coloring books", "art", and "yoga". I'm not hating on anyone's way of dealing with stress but if you are actually mentally ill, these things won't help. And I'm down right fucking sick of being suggested little BS hobbies like that for my actually severe mental health issues (bipolar). The only thing that *marginally* helps is medication. *Maybe* therapy if you aren't in too deep.	Medication. I tried pretty much all the advice out there. I went through various CBT techniques. I tried distracting myself with fun hobbies or exercise. The one thing that finally made the difference was getting on daily medication.
What's an opinion of yours that you want challenged?	llegal immigration is completely wrong and disrespectful to legal immigrants like me who either waited a long time or acquired useful skills to immigrate. Illegal immigrants should be deported if they're not in danger and are simply economic migrants.	Some families aren't meant to last a lifetime. I believe that it's healthy to break up with your family if they're toxic, just as it's healthy to leave a toxic partner.
Girlfriend wants me to wear a t-shirt that says "If you insult my girlfriend, my fist will be the last thing you see". What is the stupidest thing your SO has asked you to do?	I'd have no problem fighting a guy who insults my girlfriend given he's being an asshole and his complaint is way off base. I would have a problem wearing a retarded tshirt that basically says "I'm my girlfriend's bitch".	I used to date a girl that got off on seeing her boyfriends get in fights. She'd start them. I didn't date her for long.
At what point did you decide "Fuck it. I'm out." with a shitty friend and why?	When her ideas became extremist propaganda. When the people she had been fighting for became the enemy. When the struggle for free speech became the struggle to silence the opposition. When facts were reduced to opinions. When the feminist became the misandrist.	There's a thing that I do when I am thinking of ditching a friendship. I think about all the times I have gone out of my way to help a person or make them happy. Then I think about the times they have done it for me. I often find that my friends are only my friends because I am generous. I seem to attract people who are selfish and/or needy. If I have a hard time thinking of even a single time they have ever gone out of their way to help me or do something nice for me, I start seriously considering severing ties.
Women who moved cities with your SO or to be with your SO, how did it go?	Not just cities, but states. Move half way across the country and while it started out absolutely hellish, it has turned out way better than I expected. Adjusting from going to LDR to moving in together and being around one another 24/7 was...intense. I was used to having more 'space' and he'd never had a gf live with him. There was adjustment on both ends, we got married and like our life together, we have lots of good friends and actvities that keep us social/busy. We also have two kids, and therein was the problem. I miss my family anyway but now that I have kids is magnified it. If I see a few generations of a family at a restaurant, I'm fighting back tears because I can't share my kids with my family doing things and going places that I did. It fucking sucks.	Well not just for HIM per se, but also a job. It sucks lmao I hate my life and want to move back.
Have you been a creep to someone? When did you realize it?	It was never revealed to the guy, but after we split up I memorized the last 4 of his phone number so if he called or texted I would know it was him, but I deleted his number so I wouldn't be tempted to reach out. We got back together 8 months later but I never told him about it. My friends swore it was creepy.	I don't know how creepy it is, but I tend to look up people I'll be working closely with. I generally don't let that be known, but with one student who joined my lab, I slipped and mentioned his lifeguarding during a meet and greet supper. He hadn't mentioned that he lifeguarded and was genuinely confused. And called me out on it.
What's the line between nice and leading a guy on?	In my opinion, if a guy likes a girl it's his responsibility to ask her out (similarly if a girl is into a guy it's in her best interest to make her feelings known directly). Up to that point it's not your responsibility to do anything. Once you're asked out you need to be direct and final in your answer, don't try to soften the blow at all, just let him know you aren't interested in a romantic relationship. Most guys will ask a girl out before they're head over heals into her and can accept rejection stoically. The people who don't are the squeaky wheels that you hear about all of the time, but honestly as long as you don't end the friendship or treat him/her like some creepy perv for showing an interest they won't hold it against you or suffer any sort of excessive emotional damage.	I'm attracted to pretty girls that are nice to me. I also tend to be friends with girls that are nice to me. So if you're my friend, you're pretty, and you're nice to me and you're available, chances are I will ask you out. You're not doing anything wrong. These things just happen. When I think "leading someone on," it's generally more of a conscious decision to pretend to like someone in order to get attention/benefits/etc. Those people who do that are awful, like you said.
What's a sacrifice if any that you have had to make in order to start succeeding at dating?	Cliché', but I had to stop being a *genuinely* nice guy. Not a NiceGuy^TM but a actual, genuine nice guy who just tried to treat women well and wasn't just out trying to get laid. Once I started being more of a dick and didn't really care whether I (emotionally) hurt women, my dating life picked up significantly. I didn't really like the person I had to become, but I got over it.	Money. Getting in shape, eating well, buying new clothes, etc. all cost money, and dating itself costs money too. I had to come to terms that this was an investment, and that I wasn't going to see any dividends until I put some money, time, and effort into it.
Have you ever been forbidden or discouraged from doing something because "girls don't [fill in the blank]"?	*Women don't shoot themselves.* Only a woman who had so completely lost any sense of self, gone absolutely crazy, would just a gun to take her own life because *A woman wouldn't leave such a mess for someone to find.* She was suffering from life-shattering delusions, and her gender didn't change how she felt. **Suicide is suicide, no matter the gender of the person.**	When I was eight I really wanted to grow a beard. A big Santa beard! I told my mom about my aspirations, and she told me I couldn't since I was a girl. I was devastated, and thought she meant that I wasn't allowed to, not that I physically was unable. That's all I have. My mom and dad were pretty accepting and thought my brothers and I should learn things equally.
Women who have seen their SO get hit on without their SO realizing what was happening, what’s your story?	Bartender at a local pub would only talk to and a acknowledge my boyfriend. Every time we went there she would ‘accidentally’ pour him the wrong beer and give him a free beer. Now she works at the same place as him and has said his butt looked good in his work pants. I’m not worried because she is quite literally built like and looks like a man, so my boyfriend wouldn’t be interested.	We were at this bar that has a whole bunch of arcade games. I disappeared to go to the bathroom and this girl came up to him and started stroking my boyfriend's back and telling him how good he was at Shrek pinball. My boyfriend had a mild moment of panic because he's an awkward guy and is pretty socially anxious so he just straight up sped walked away to come find me.
Women who got married to someone who they only knew for a year or less, how did your marriage turn out?	So my now husband and I met and decided to make a kid about 3 months in the relationship. We got married when our son was maybe 4 months old. We were planning a wedding but eloped because we didn't want to wait, we just wanted to be a family on paper. It's only been a year but I would do it all again.	When I was nineteen I married a man I'd known for nine months. We divorced six years later after he came out to me on my birthday.
What to do when other guys are flirting with your girlfriend?	Ok funny story time. My wife is very naive. When we go out with friends we don't hang all over each other we do our own thing being we are around each other all the time. So I see my wife at the bar and a older gentleman is chatting her up. I swing by give her a kiss not even understanding what is going on until she introduces him to me and he got up apologised and offered me his seat. To which my reply was " sir were all here to enjoy ourselves. You feel free to keep buying my wife drinks if you wish. You warm up the tractor, I'll plow the field later." Then I just walked away lol. Guy was dumbfounded.	Smile and laugh because you get to fuck her later and you trust her to not jump into bed with any random guy who makes a move.
Why are so many people in the dating scene in competition with each other over who cares the least?	We live in a culture that is easily offended by anything and everything. All in a sad attempt to prevent hurting feelings. This bleeds over into the dating scene as well, but in an interesting way. The one who cares the most in the relationship tends to be hurt the most. So to combat that, people adopt an attitude of not caring. Not saying that it's not needed to some degree but to an extreme is a set up for failure.	I think its from the throwaway culture that has moved into dating now. Why bother to put in any effort to a Tinder or Bumble match conversation when you can just swipe 50 more times and get new ones? It's the feeling that there's always something better hiding around the corner so any perceived minor flaw becomes a deal breaker. The problem is 2-5 messages don't usually actually show any flaws, it's just people's unrealistic expectations to begin with.
Men, who was the classiest woman you ever had the pleasure of dating in your life thus far? What made her so special?	Always wore dresses, had a brilliant smile that lit up a room but it was rare to see. I don’t think she owned any yoga pants, ugg boots, crocs, Nutella, Netflix, Social Media, all the ‘basic shit’ that makes people...well, boring. She didn’t have it in her life and as a result her world didn’t revolve around it.	My current gf. She is unfailingly kind, friendly, and outgoing, even to people she just met, which is a rarity in general but especially in NY. She's whip-smart, confident, funny, independent, a great hostess, dresses well with a unique sense of style, generally game for everything and a joy to be around in any social situation. The biggest thing though, is that she can always carry a conversation in a way that involves everybody if need be, but is also an attentive and curious listener.
AskMen, What are some relationship red flags?	Fat entitled hairy feminists are the ultimate turn off. The closer you are to that the less attractive you are.	* Indicating that she thinks violence is an acceptable way to resolve a dispute * Indicating that she views sex as transactional * Entitlement to a certain standard of living that she is not providing for herself * Inability to save money or follow a budget * Ill treatment of people who are required to be nice to her * Attention-seeking behavior (maintaining an army of instagram/facebook orbiters, etc) * Racism, classism, sexism
As a 5'3" man who feels insecure about my height, what do you do about that?	What do you \*do\*? I'm sure other commenters will give you the standard advice: work out, get swole, accept yourself, there's someone out there for everyone, etc. But here are two more extreme options... **Leg Lenthening:** Leg lengthing costs something like $50k, can get you between 2" and 3", and only takes a few months. These days you don't need pins sticking out of your legs. They just put a remote-controlled rod in your leg and extend it slowly over weeks. That'd put you closer to 5'6". Not tall, but, taller than many women. Weirdly, Las Vegas is where all the best clinics are for that. **Moving:** There are a lot of countries where 5'3" is not an unusual height for a man. Guatemala, Laos, the Philippines. Maybe just start a new life in another country. Edit: upped the cost after looking it up.	How old are you? I don't mean that in a malicious way because I'm 5'3 (or 2, not really sure) but at the age of 30, the last I heard about my height from others was in my early 20s, in a toxic workplace. Now I'm married and while I'm not well-off financially, I have a managerial role and I well respected in the company that I'm in. Believe me, my height got to me but things always come right if you believe they will...and I sure had hope that they did. But also what another person said, exercise! Working out did wonders for my self-esteem!
How long were your SO and you together before you stole their favorite hoodie?	My husband hates hoodies, so I've never seen him wear one. I'd be creeped out if he did. Of the guys I've dated who wear hoodies, I've never borrowed or stolen one. I can handle being around guys, but hoodies seem to soak up the smell of their deodorant or body spray and saturate to smell of choking me if I try to wear it. I'm really sensitive to smells and can't handle strong ones for long periods of time, so hoodies are safe from me.	I offered my SO a sacrificial hoodie on our second date, so she wouldn't steal my actual favorite hoodie. So far, my countermeasures have worked
Men of Reddit. How many of you have never had a one night stand, and is that a result of choice or inability?	Every single person who replies here is going to say by choice, but we all know it’s due to inability.	Never. Inability I suppose, but it's more accurate to say it's just not in my nature. I'm more of an introvert, so the idea of going out to a bar and striking up a conversation with a stranger is pretty foreign to me. And even if I did, I'm not sure I have to social prowess to pull that off.
OK fellas here we go. How would you take it if your son came out and told you he was bi or gay?	I’d be pretty pissed if he was my only son, let’s be real. But at the end of the day what can I do? Accept him and move on, probably try to have another son that will hopefully not be gay that can give me grandbabies. Before you say it, no - adoption doesn’t count. Sorry not sorry. Just being honest	He already knows it wouldn't change a thing; I get quite yelly about not treating lgbtq relationships as less-than. I would, however, *definitely* do the 'hello Gay, I'm dad' thing, because I am not made of fucking stone.
Guys, what is the sexiest thing a girl has done to seduce you, either intentionally or unintentionally?	One of my Ex Girlfriends said to me in bed "Im not wearing any pants" my response was "What taken you so long mine were off minuets ago" she was straight on it like a car bonnet, and I dunnoh how I did it (probably the all night gaming sessions helped) but yeah, it was an all night experience...	After my girlfriend got off of work one day, we had the house to ourselves, so we were watching some movies together and whatnot, she got thirsty so we went to the kitchen. We'd already been goofing off a bit sexually, but when in the kitchen she tried to reach for something kind of high up and had to stand on her toes for it, and I don't quite understand what it was, she only had a blouse and her underwear on, but I pretty much lost it. Might have broken the cup. Maybe.
How many of you guys don't really care about food?	I eat because I have to, I have low appetite and very picky about what I eat. Pizza is life tho.	I'm completely content eating trash, or eating the same thing consecutively, or whatever. I don't when my wife is around because she deserves to eat like a human, but if I'm at home cooking for just myself, I'm good with a PB & J with a bowl of cereal or WHATEVER is lagging sound the house.
Has anybody here ever had their "relationship intuition" proven right? What happened?	And yet, whenever some guy post on Reddit that his GF is being "so unreasonable" about his good friend, who *just happens to be a woman,* but there is nothing between them and GF is just paranoid. . . The Reddit brigade starts shouting about how she is a controlling bitch. How come AskMen gets to claim this as "relationship intuition"?	Yes, same thing essentially here, cheated on me and started dating him the second we were over. I guess when you are close to someone you can pick up on something like this, as in it kind of feels off.
How do you get revenge on your worst enemy without breaking the law?	>No serious answers like "get revenge by living a better life" or mature stuff like that Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me. Living well is the best revenge. Suck it.	Put laxative in the water supply. In the Army We were in the field for two weeks Warned all but one crew member to stay away from that particular 5 gallon water jug. That crew member was a fucking asshole. That banged the wife of a squad mate, and tried to slip it to another one's missus He shat non stop for a fortnight
Ladies , what are some stories about your dad being awesome?	He used to drive me (and my friends) everywhere. If I asked him to drive me/us somewhere and/or pick us up, I knew he would always say yes. Even after I moved out, he would take me grocery shopping, or even pick me up at my apartment and take me somewhere if I asked. There was one time he drove one of my friends home after he dropped me off and she asked if he minded driving me around and he said something along the lines of, "I don't mind. I like talking to her." I thought that was really cute, especially because my dad doesn't really say things like that.	He used to drive me (and my friends) everywhere.

What is the biggest personality change you've seen someone go through?	a few years ago, my friend became a druggie, and became a major piece of ----. she became the biggest, most disrespectful ---- I ever met. she was in disbelief when I ended the friendship.	My highschool friend comes in my mind. While his mom was still married to his asshole dad he was kind of awkward, quiet, and a bit mean. When his parents divorced, he became more relaxed, confident, fun, and witty. It was a great change. I hope he is still doing great.
Men, have you ever been accused of rejecting/excluding/being rude to a woman just because she is a woman, and it was not that way at all?	I posted on AskWomen once and thought I was going to get killed. They aren't very friendly over there, especially if your just asking an honest question.	When I was at school we went on trip to the House of Commons and we met our local MP. I asked a question about the fact that her and many other MPs round where I live aren't locals. She went on this big long tirade about how people like me were backward and think our MPs should all be men who grew up in the area, never left and work in the local factory. Aside from the fact that she's a Labour Party MP and plays up to the fact that her father's a former factory worker, I was a bit put annoyed that she got defensive and built up a straw man rather than politely answering me, as a young student from the area she's supposed to represent.
Was just in a deep conversation with a coworker, which resulted in me following him into the mens room. What have you had a mental fail at recently?	The exact same thing happened to me last year, when I followed a coworker into the women's room. However, HR deemed that to be sexual harassment and I was fired. Go figure!	I'm blaming my mental fail on being sick and hopped up on cold meds (summer colds are the worst ugggggh), but this morning I got my coffee from Starbucks and as the barista handed it to me and told me to have a nice day, I said "you too, I love you, bye." And then it was an awkward pause before I walked away. Whatever, he deserved to feel loved this morning.
Sex with your skirt on, hot or not?	I'm a guy and going to answer. It's my number 1 fantasy and works in so many scenarios. Like we're both at home, she is doing something on the kitchen counter, I bend her over, get frisky Or at work with a co-worker, or at school.	Hot as long as the clothing isn't damaged. I'm all for being spontaneous and having a quickie, but if he rips/tears/damages my clothes then I get cranky.
How do you feel about women using the the mens restroom when you are out at the Bars?	Go for it. I don't care. Frankly I'm more surprised by the number of men on reddit who are offended that they can't go in the women's bathroom. (People get offended so easily these days /s)	Bothers me on principle. From all the women I know who have done this they are both entitled and hypocritical. They feel they should be allowed in there but men shouldn't be allowed in theirs. In practice I don't care.
As Men, do you resent that when something bad happens, you have to be the shoulder to cry on rather than crying yourself?	It's our job as men to stay strong in tough situations. It always has been throughout history. That's not to say you can't let it all out every now and then but only after that tough moment is over.	The only time I ever really objected to that was the time a girl broke up with me, then- on the spot, during the same conversation- wanted me to let her cry on my shoulder. About her breakup. With me.
How do I stop viewing sex as something that has to be earned by men?	Outside of what mass media and social media likes to espouse as what "should" be, you are experiencing what "is". In short and in general (there are of course exceptions) , women do not make the first move and women want to be courted. This why you feel you have to "earn" it and frankly you should try to earn it. Why would you want to be with someone to didn't make you earn it just a bit?	So I was talking to my partner about this, and it's something we even struggle in within our relationship. Even when they want to instigate sex they struggle to do so, this is a thing that is conditioned on both sides. I do think that there needs to be a re-framing of what's actually going on though. When women have sex the stakes are a little higher, so there is a larger amount of trust needed to be put into the person they are having sex with. You aren't earning sex, you're earning trust.
How the fuck do you whiten your teeth?	chemicals. people laugh at the british for yellowed teeth, and exaggerate it, but the uk has some of the best teeth on the planet, teeth are supposed to be off white or light yellow, your tooth enamel is white, and the dentine below is yellow.	Teeth aren't actually supposed to be really white and many whitening toothpastes aren't recommended by most dentists because most of them damage enamel over the years. Real white takes more than a toothpaste too because you have to actually change the enamel colour. That Hollywood smile is obtained by professional tooth bleaching.
We are used to hearing about common complaints from heterosexual relationships, but what are some common complaints particular to same sex relationships?	Hey. Guys. From one fellow straight dude to another... If you’re here because you’re a Straight Dude With An Opinion (tm) that needs to be heard, just...don’t. It is not about you. And that’s okay. Promise. Your answers will be removed for derailing. To those of you that are coming here to sexualize the comments people are making, don’t make it weird.	Hey. Guys.

Have you ever looked at someone and been like "oh lord, I wish she was mine." Why and who was she?	Nope. >Why Because whilst I've seen incredibly attractive women, I do not know her, nor do I know her personality. While she may be physically attractive, she could have the personality of a brick. So whilst I can look at a girl and say that I'd wanna have sex with her, I can not, nor will not, say that I wish she were my gf (as this title implies)	I met a girl at a friend's birthday party maybe 3 years ago. She was beautiful, charming, funny, she spent a good part of the night talking to me and laughing at my jokes, and she spoke some Ukrainian (which I was trying to learn at the time). Her fiance was also at the party. He seemed like a cool dude, and I came away from the party thinking he's a lucky guy.
Those of you who picked the wrong career (for you), when did you realize you weren't on the right track?	When I graduated, I felt kinda empty while everyone was really happy, I was glad for my friends but I couldn't get their feeling I was just enjoying it like a party or so, but I couldn't care less for my Engineer title, then I discovered my love for programming and then I got a work as Physics Profesor at a University while working as programer.	When I came home crying every night for being so miserable. Finished my contract, took a holiday and jumped into the deep end and became a chef/cook. Best move ever.
How much did you change physically from your High School graduation to your college graduation?	I haven't graduated college yet but I graduated high school a dude and will (hopefully) graduate college as a woman.	When I graduated from high school, I was mistaken for a middle school student. When I graduated from college, I was mistaken for a high school student. That was progress, of a sort.
Gals who have gained weight because of quarantine/lockdown: how are you coping?	Get those gains, get dummy thick, don’t be afraid of gaining weight, turn that shit into muscle and use it as fuel. If you’re even able to get fat that’s a blessing-it means you’re eating good!	I feel horrible. I have never hated myself more. I saw myself in a picture and cried in my car.
What did you think of sex after your first time?	It wasn't mind blowing amazing. But I knew it would get better after come practise. Well over 2000 times later it's pretty good. I know how to pleasure a woman in many many ways. Even how to achieve the 3 different orgasms you can give her. 1. Basic orgasm. 2. Full on. Also known as deep or giant. 3. Rolling or multiple.	SLightly dissapointed. Kinda. Like yes it was awesome, sex IS aweseome but it wasn't life changing or anything. I was the same guy I was before except I'd lost my V card.
Women of Reddit, When and how did you realise you were above/below average attractiveness?	When I was 14 and at the beach chilling with 2 of my friends both the same age, and a douchebag looking guy in a nice suit driving a ferrari approached us, wondering if we'd be interested in doing porn for a huge amount of money. We politely said no and told him our age, in which he replied; "Oh that's ok, no one will know". We got really creeped out but I guess most women in porn is pretty hot, so thanks??	I notice when I started college and began working. I am below average. I know this because how people treat me. No one goes out of their way to help me at work, but if this other girl has a little "issues" they all flock over to help. A lot of guys at my work won't even give me the time of day. I don't think anyone as called me out on my looks. I don't think I am ugly, I am more of an "ehh". Oh wells, I just need to work on myself more. I started a diet (Well a life change) a month ago and I lost about ten pounds now. Just 30 more to go!
What is a quality you thought you wanted in a significant other, but eventually learned wasn't compatible with you?	Thought I wanted an equal partner. Nope. I need a woman who is cool with me being the head of the household.	Someone who looked up to me. I thought that for awhile. It turns out, it's exhausting pretending to be a rock for someone else's emotions. I later thought I wanted the other opposite: complete independence. It turns out, that's draining as well. It's difficult being with someone who treats you as expendable, and enjoys reminding you of it. It may be fair, but it's not comforting.
What things do you do to manage your anxiety?	I have an anxiety disorder. I manage it through a small dose of sertaline, counseling, and consistently pushing myself to confront things that make me anxious. The first two are basically to help me do the last thing. As I've found that being and learning to adjust to situations that make you anxious is by far the best way to deal with anxiety.	Mine might sound weird, but listening to familiar noises/voices. Either in music, TV shows, podcasts, etc etc. My current soother is Judge Judy and some old Dance Gavin Dance.
What is something that men over complicate that is so simple to women?	Putting down the damn toilet seat. Why are we having an argument over this? You put it up. You should put it down.	Cleaning, in my experience. I know so many guys who can't just clean one thing, but every time there's "project cleaning", like cleaning out the fridge, it's a 3 hour event that they have to rope everyone in the house into. But then that may just be me pulling a trend out of a handful of people.
What are some causes you are passionate about?	Helping turn the working class into a revolutionary class to seize the means of production and overturn the dictatorship of the bourgeois class into a dictatorship of the proletarian class.	Donating blood. There's always a need, it costs nothing but time, and youre helping out a person in need. Also supporting animal shelters and preventing animal cruelty.
AW, what are some of the worst reasons to HAVE children that you've ever heard?	Because I Want one (no bearing on if the children would hypothetically want to be born in the circumstances) So many people are so selfish when it comes to that decision.	I used to have a friend who said he wanted kids for the benefits so he didn't have to work, even mentioned a few times that he hoped it would be disabled because then he would receive even more in benefits..... Couldn't believe my ears when he told me
Men Who Were In Abusive Relationships, How Has it Affected You?	I'm a weird case, in that I grew up in an abusive home and as an adult won't tolerate ANY of that. Most people normalize it and play out their childhoods in their relationships. So...I'm attentive to any signs of a problem, I'm able to pretty quickly un-invest in someone if they act out, and I'm generally emotionally...not very available. I'm also slow to let people in and quick to kick them out.	Taught me to never trust what others gossip or say. I was hit, abused, everything. I have it on video too, only family has seen that. This was three years ago, and as recently as last fucking week she was still going around telling everyone i hit her not the other way around (she said this last week to a mutual friend of my girlfriend). Guess how many “friends” believed her? Most of em. Thats why whenever i hear a side i wait for both sides and evidence. If you think someone should be believed solely cause of their gender (#believewomen) im here to personally say fuck you with a rusty knife.
My boyfriend claims that doing the "helicopter dick" is impossible. Has anyone been successful?	I'm sorry to say this, but I think your boyfriend can't do it because his penis is too small when flaccid/semi-erect, not because no one can do it. He's just making an excuse...	I'm a woman, but I went to a clothing optional beach once and there was a dude lounging on the rocks, facing the ocean, leisurely helicoptering his dick and looking really pleased with himself.
When in a long term relationship/married does your sex drive lower or do you not enjoy having sex as much as you did before? If so Why?	yes. her vagina is like a new video game,... until I learn all the cheat codes. after that theres less challenge and therefore less satisfaction in defeating it.	It's typical for it to be higher in the beginning of the relationship when everything is new and shiny. Things slowed down a bit, but not a whole lot. I still love making sexy times with my lady. Here's the important thing to remember though - Sex is 10% of a good relationship, and 90% of a bad one.
Men, what kind of sexism do you experience, and what do you think should be done to combat it?	Why feminism and not egalitarianism? Feminism is specifically the advocacy of **women's** rights in regards to equality to men. Whereas egalitarianism is the belief that all people should be treated equally regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status etc. I'm not trying to be snarky but there is already a word for equality for everyone and it's not feminism.	One of the mods of /r/askmen wrote this up once. It's pretty much the Definitive Answer to your question, at least at an abstract level https://www.notehub.org/2015/1/8/not-all-is-great-in-the-world-of-men It tries very hard to address your first question while avoiding "what we should do". ---- EDIT: The credit belongs to /u/dakru. I just dug it up. He wrote it. Kudos to him!

Long time single women of reddit, what are the benefits?	can a long time single guy answer too? i love everything about women usually, and having a girlfriend is also very fun, i just don't really miss the fights for small things just because i or her are in a bad mood. Couples are a team not a punching bag, and that is the only thing i don't miss. all the other stuff.. pretty cool	I know this isn't the case for many or most long term single women but personally speaking, I've never been pestered about when I'm going to have children, and I suspect this might not be the case if I had a boyfriend.
Why is the idea of the "nice" guy demonized so much on the internet?	> the things that these guys do are mostly awkward and not malicious. Grand gestures for girls who barely know them with a strong sense of entitlement to that girls vagina comes to mind. I find that malicious and disgusting, personally.	There are lots of guys who think that doing nice things for a girl who is friendly to him will get him sex eventually. They seem to think that a woman's attraction can be bought with favors. Nice guys are only a big deal though when they are overly consistent or creepy, though. The typical guy who eventually get the message that the woman isn't interested in him and then backs off is more of a sad figure, really.
What are some unexpected expenses for single man that younger guys don't think of?	For me it was sex. I’m a really unfortunate looking young male and I consistently have to pay for sex. It can run me anywhere from $100-$300 per bang, depending on quality/looks of the woman.	For me it was everything taken for granted. Toilet paper. Toothpaste. Soap. The way I take these into account is I have a budget and I leave a floating number of my average expenses in that regard to keep me safe. I always overestimate so I have more wiggle room to deal with. Using an excel sheet really helps
How can a man who is tired of being average become better?	Jordan Peterson is a great motivator to improve in all areas of your life. I'd highly recommend watching some of his lectures on YouTube. Any of them will do.	You already started, now continue from there. Add pushups or other bodyweight exercises after running if you dont want to hit the gym.
When I drive a girl home after a good date, I drive just a little slower than normal to spend a little more time with her. What little things like this do you do on your dates?	This is the complete opposite of me. I want the date to be over with so I can go home and relax in my solitude.	I usually start a long conversation about 3/4ths of the way home that way we usually end up parked outside her home just talking.
Ladies who are chronically single, what do you think is the reason for that?	im triggered by your terminology but the reason i am single is because i want to be. I am dating a few men but nothing serious because ive already been married and divorced and want none of that ever again	I’ve not met someone who likes me when I like them. I’m comfortable being single and living my life. I’m not willing to lower my standards just to be in a relationship. I’ve broken up with guys in the past because I’d rather be single then in a shitty relationship or to be treated poorly.
For those of you who have/had feelings for a female friend but never told her; why didn’t you say anything?	From the 8th grade to about my Senior year in high school, I had a crush on one girl named Nnandi Davis. She used to say "hi" and talk to me sometimes, but I was extremely shy and thought that it was a bad thing to be straightforward about my interest in her. Eventually I found out around the school that she had a boyfriend, and I was a little upset with myself for not making a move on her sooner and at least letting her know that I liked her.	This was a common thing for me in high school and college, and while my excuse was fear of rejection, the reality is that it was a mix of either one-sided adoration or unwillingness to take a risk. In my adult life, I've spent time with people and tried to see if feelings emerge mutually. A part of it is, as an adult, I tend to meet people either directly for dating purposes (i.e., meet someone at a party/event/bar and ask them out right there), or through a mutual activity where bonding occurs simultaneously. There are just fewer opportunities for this "longing" to occur.
If you had an emotionally abusive mom, when was your breaking point that you stopped taking it?	Can men answer this question? Mine was when she faked a heart attack to prevent me from finding a job and becoming independent. I put an ocean between me and my family and never looked back.	I drove five hours in a blizzard to see her and my dad and the first words out of her mouth were that I had love handles, and my boyfriend at the time must have been "into big women." I snapped.
What's the weirdest object that has been inside of your vagina?	A stocking. I used to cam and a client would like me to stuff a stocking up there and slowly pull it out. I hated it. It was dry and felt awfully uncomfortable, even painful. I pretended to like it, though, of course. Had to make that money and stroke that male ego.	A popsicle, a candle, cucumber, travel size conditioner bottle, underwear, dagger hilt, safe edge of a razor, Mardi Gras beads, a cane, an umbrella handle, and a cigar tube. That all probably sounds super weird outside of context. So to clear things up, I work in the adult industry.
What's the worst handling of a serious topic you've seen in a TV show or movie?	Disclaimer: I love It's Always Sunny. The one thing that really bothered me, though, was the depiction of Dee's pregnancy and giving birth. It wasn't offensive - or even as "offensive" as many of the jokes on that show have the potential to be - but there was absolutely 0 jokes about the pregnancy itself, i.e. What happens when you're pregnant (besides eating a lot). The episodes really just focused on the guys trying to figure out who the dad was - which was funny. But I think there could have been so much potential if only the show had centered on Dee's actual experience.	Anyone remember that movie 40 days and 40 nights? At the end that blonde chick rapes him. There are no two ways about this. She walks into his place before the time is up, jumps on his bed while he's asleep, and rapes him. And somehow this is his fault, and the girlfriend gets mad and runs away in tears, and it's never addressed at all. I was fucking appalled.
Whats the most dangerous thing your child has done?	When he was about 4, he pulled his hand out of my mother's and ran across a lane of the parking lot. After that, my mother and I had a short but intense discussion about how she actually has to *hold* his hand and not just rely on him gripping her finger.	I laid my son down for a nap in his crib when he was 18 months old. He climbed out of his crib (had never done that before) and then climbed onto a rocking chair, up the back of it, and then pushed out a screen and went out the window. The window looked out onto the flat roof on the mud porch of the house. My baby was on the roof. My neighbor saw him and banged on the door. When she told me, I ran upstairs and yanked him back in. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. He's 15 now :)
Girls who are generally unenthusiastic/low energy- how do friends/partners ever dislike it? How do you deal with it?	I met a girl like this once. She talked so...monotone. It was actually quite unpleasant to talk to her even though she was saying something that was interesting I found myself losing interest. She was trying to find a job and had gone to all sorts of interviews and never got called back. I wanted to mention it to her that it was most likely because she had no voice inflection and talked like a zombie but we weren’t that close. I am sure someone had to have mentioned it to her before. I myself am overly descriptive and loud and a lot of people can take that the wrong way too lol	People think I'm mad or I dislike them when in truth, I'm just chillin and it probably has nothing to do with them. My tone or body language is more laid back and unlady-like so people assume that I'm not in a good mood or a sour pus. I just don't like making a scene or being loud.
How sick are you before you decide to call in to work?	I stay home from work when I'm feeling even slightly sick. I always resent it when people come into work sick and I catch it, so I'm not going to do that to other people. Sick days exist for a reason. On the other hand, I would only miss class if I was dying because professors give no shits.	There are three solid rules: If I am feeling so unwell that I can't concentrate on something like writing notes even with medication, if I am worried I have something contagious that could harm my coworkers' children (e.g. something with a bad fever, strep throat, pink eye, gastro), if I would need to make frequent and unpredictable bathroom trips. Or any combination of the above. If you work in customer service, especially serving food, or if you work in a medical profession with patients who are in compromised condition, I think it's totally cool to stay home for anything that might be even somewhat transmittable.
How do people react when you tell them about your career?	“Soo... what’s your interest in that...???” I run a camp for LGBTQ+ kids and parents. I’m queer, but I pass most of the time. Every time I mention what I do, within a breath, someone is trying to make sure I was just outing myself. Which is fine, I guess.	My job is not that interesting, so one or two boring questions like “what does that involve exactly” “do you like it” and that’s the end of it
What is your #WhyIDidntReport story?	He and I were both equally drunk. If I can't be held accountable for my actions or words when I'm drinking, then why should he be? **Edit:** Just to clarify, mine was only attempted assault/rape, he wasn't successful in his efforts. If he had actually done the deed or if we'd been sober, I would have reported.	Because the very next morning, 9/11 happened and I didn’t think what happened to me was important enough compared to what was happening to the country.
What acts of affection from your significant other are your favorite?	Random acts of BJ's. They're at their best when you don't have to ask and it's enthusiastic. Nothing compares. Always slightly less than you want, like if you want one a day, getting a free one 4 to 5x a week beats asking every day.	I tell my wife not to make my coffee, she doesn't drink coffee so logically it shouldn't be her responsibility. She does it anyway.
Does Porn ever depress you?	No not really. For some reason the semi-degrading forceful ish nature of mainstream porn turns me on. Revenge porn and the industries strange practices **Trigger warning** I have personally watched a "gangbang" video where the woman was clearly on a lot of drugs (was semi-unresponsive seemed to have a very high pain threshold and had poor skin condition etc etc) and was filmed with one camera in what looked like a basement on a single dirty mattress. I reported it but nothing came from it. **Trigger over** While I personally don't feel strongly either way about consensual domination seeing it seems to turn me on for some reason...	Cunnilingus is no where to be found, and when you do find it, it lasts like 15 seconds at most. The remaining 15 minutes of the video will be dedicated to a blowjob. I get depressed when I look for the most basic of acts dedicated to women's pleasure and can't find any.
Women who dated/married a man you settled for, why?	I never believed in marriage. I met my now husband on Tinder and i instantly knew i was going to spend the rest of my life with him. We only got married because we’re both from different countries. We didn’t make a big deal out of it. In the End it’s just a sheet of paper. But it was more than that. I feel like our love has grown stronger and deeper since we’re married. I thought the opposite would happen. I couldn’t imagine anyone else by my side and i feel like the luckiest woman in the world to have had caught the most living and caring Husband that goes out of his way every day to make me happy :) hang in there. Real love still exist	It was identical to my parents relationship - we were always mildly irritated by one another, never really romantic with each other. I thought that's what relationships were because of my parents. Then I found my current partner. Even after nearly 10 years, it still blows my mind that I have such loving emotional support.
what country would you like to visit?	America. I live in southern Canada and can basically go whenever I want, but I want to visit before the election cuz I don't plan on going for the next 4 years.	I always wanted to go to Hong Kong, so I booked a trip this November. I'm going by myself. Why? Because I desperately need to do something that isn't routine.
How many sexual partners have you had? How many LTRs have you been in?	I'm 41. I couldn't tell you how many sexual partners I've had. God knows. 100+ I think. I've been in two long term relationships -I married them both. I had a long term affair as well but maybe best not to count that one.	I'm 25 and Asian-American. I've had sex with 3 girls, all of whom are also the long-term girlfriends I've had. I may sound old-fashioned, but I only have sex with a girl who I am officially in an exclusive relationship with. I have made out with girls at parties, and even tried to have casual sex with one, but I backed out of it because I just couldn't get more intimate without the emotional feelings a relationship brings.
What's the strangest thing that a therapist has said to you, or suggested?	He told me that my feelings were driving my thoughts, but my thoughts should drive my feelings. Basically, my depression was my own fault and I could just think it away.	A therapist thought I was genderfluid once. I have no idea how she came to that conclusion, as I'm pretty solidly female.
How happy (or sad) are you as a lone wolf?	Not really according to society, its just human nature. People are social animals. I aint gonna tell you how to live your life and maybe you convinced yourself that you're content, but you're really missing out on life by limiting your experiences. I go through 'lone wolf' phases, but I'd rather die than live that way forever	22, in college, single. I'm happy and sad. I like to be able to focus on what it is that *I* want with minimal drama, plus I can flirt and hookup with as many girls as I choose without being judged (as long as it's safe sex). On the downside though, I don't have sex nearly as often, but the worst is at night. I just want a girl (whom I care about) to put her head on my chest and both fall asleep.
How many of you actually believe in the "nice guys finish last" concept?	I've turned down guys for being: * Rude * Ugly * Passive * Unreasonably clingy Nowhere does "nice" make this list.	I think where this idea comes from is people confusing being nice with passive and mean with assertive. Assertive people tend to do better in life because they go after what they want and let others know what they want, but it is entirely possible to be both nice and assertive.
Fellow ugly men of reddit, how did you come to term with your ugliness?	Get a girlfriend/boyfriend that thinks you're cute/handsome. Every day she'll tell you you how cute and beautiful you are and eventually you'll believe that you are these things. Then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks because your SO means everything to you and they are all that matters anymore.	basically stopped giving a shit about it. care about the people who do treat you like normal and i stopped trying to go after girls, maybe if a girl is one day interested in me ill attempt to have a relationship but im not going to go after it myself, although i dont recommend this to everyone cause i might just straight up not be as interested in a relationship as other people
What are girls doing in the bathroom pre-sex?	taking a piss then whipping her Vag very very clean. Garunteed and if she's an out of the box thinker -2 pinches on each breast	We're peeing. It's really difficult and frankly a little scary to orgasm if you need the toilet. A quick freshen up can't hurt either. Vaginas are complicated.
Women of colour, what are your experiences with being fetishised?	Not me, but my best friend is Asian and over the years I have watched her date guys with Asian fetishes. I think it's super weird and I always wonder if she knows, but at the same time I don't want to bring it up. She's an amazing person, but sometimes I wonder if that guy who just happens to be minoring in Chinese is there for her or for his fetish.	Because of some weird genetic stuff with distant ancestors, I look as though I have East Asian heritage, though I have zero East Asian heritage. The things guys say to me! Greeting me with "Ni hao" or "Konnichiwa" or "love you long time" or whatever... telling me that Asian women are better girlfriends, so docile, that they're "tighter" or whatnot. Boggles my mind. I do get a sense of small justice whenever I tell them I'm actually of Native origin, and seeing the looks on their faces as they realized they dug themselves into a shitty racist hole. :) Like, "where are you from?" Me: America. Asshole: So where is your family from? When did they come to the US? Me: On the Bering Strait, most likely. This has never happened with women I've dated. Just men.
How many women have you slept with, and were you attracted to every one?	I stopped counting long ago (probably a couple hundred). I was known as a lady's man a very alpha male. Sexual, academic, and work success fell on my lap. Friends joked that I would have a new girl every week to few weeks or so and that was true since mid high school to the end of college. I was not sexually attracted to any of them, but I wanted to be them. I think the guilt was part of the reason I just moved onto the next girl instead of revealing my transgender side.... that and I was still in denial. I was anti-LGBT and it made me feel gross. Then I came out as trans and began transitioning. Since then I have only slept with 1 woman.	Unknown. Most. The crazy thing is that my most active time in life was also my loneliest time in life.
Ladies who use Tinder, how did you react when your date looked WAY different in person? Did you still enjoy your time?	Was another dating site but he turned out to be gay (I think). he spoke in a stereotypically feminine manner complete with wrist flicking. The date consisted of him talking about his "preggo" friends baby shower and how he bakes cake pops in his free time. He also talked about teaching his male friends about fashion and how to do housework. I think he asked me a couple of questions about myself at some point. He gave me the wrong address at first too and then i locked myself out of my car when i finally got there. Worst date ever.	He had straight up used someone else's photos. When he approached me in the coffee shop after I got over the initial shock of him being significantly older, significantly shorter, significantly fatter and a different ethnicity I literally walked out without saying a word. He tried to chase after me and then berated me by text. I told him he could fuck right off and since I knew where he worked because he had used his work number to call me I threatened to call the police if he ever contacted me again. I have no interest in being catfished.
What happens at university/college, in terms of eeting women?	Heres what I did and it worked amazingly well. Before you start college, get in real good shape. You don't need to have massive muscles, but it should be real obvious you work out. Having low body fat is slightly more important, but you need both. that's all you need to do. If it works out for you as well as it did for me women will approach you and it requires zero effort. Also I did a lot of drugs back then cause I hated my life. But women thought it made me look badass, which, while untrue, seemed to help a bit. Anyway, good luck! Now go hit the gym	Not sure what its like in the UK, but here in Germany we don't eat women at university. Or at least I'm not getting invited.
Ladies, in highschool did you want sex just as much as the guys did?	Oh totally. I had to talk my boyfriend into having sex when I couldn't stand it any more. He was really hesitant.	Yes! But I wasn't that interested in my fellow high school students, so I ended up not dating very much. I had a lot of fantasies about being older and finally allowed to go after the kinds of people I found attractive.
What do you think about drinking in front of children?	It can be a little weird. My cousin has been taught that "alcohol is bad" so its a bit weird when someone in the family brings a few bombers of beer to Thanksgiving. My friend has a big family that is not afraid to drink around the kids. That can be weird. But they are not my children and there are usually a number of people sober. So I enjoy myself.	I think it's perfectly fine. I don't drink much anymore, but my wife will pour herself a glass of wine or make a mixed drink around dinner time or whatever, and I see no issue with that. My kids know what alcohol is, the dangers of over use, and of course, that it's not for them until they're much older. If anything, I think exposure to responsible use is probably a good thing.
Question from a loner: What do social people do all day?	i do what ever the fuck i want. i wanna stay in i sty in. i wanna go out i go out.	I wish this question had more responses. I'm trying to break out of being a loner, but I have no real experience being social and don't know what to consider normal.
What is your favorite unusual name?	My husband has been insisting that our first daughter be named after his grandmother Lillian. I convinced him that name was too old fashioned, so we compromised on Lilly Anne. In exhange, I got to choose girl name number 2 and boy name number 1. My favorite boy name do far is Hunter Blake. The girl name is Willow, but I'm stumped on a middle name that goes with it.	You mean names from my future baby name bank? Because I have one of those haha. I like antiquated names, like Vera, Penny, Maisie, Moira. I knew a girl from Fiji who's name was "Simi," and I've always really liked her name.
So men...how fat is fat on a woman?	Most of the other guys here consider 35% and higher to be fat? WTF, 35% ain't even average. I find all the bodies up to and including 35% attractive, but I wouldn't use the term "fat" for any but the last two. 40% is a weird case - it doesn't look like she's carrying the weight well. In the body type chart: 12 and 16 and above also seems to lose quite a bit of attractivess, except for 19. Hrm. Wonder why. Not really into 7 either. She's got a pretty face, but those muscles just scare me. Also 14 appears to have a lower BMI that what is really average, 3's proportions appear to be 'shopped (the difference between her chest and hips is rather inhuman) and maybe 1 is 'shopped too.	In the rough bodyfat chart, 35% is the threshold, but the thing is different women carry weight differently. For example that 30% woman looks great in that picture and she obviously carries that weight very well, where another woman just wouldn't look that good.
Men of Reddit, what is one thing that you think every woman should know?	At least look behind you before you let the door slam shut. A lot of men do this to be chivalrous, but because when you don't do it, you look you do it makes it obvious you only think about yourself.	I can't read your mind. If you want me to know something, the best way is to just tell me and save everyone a lot of time and grief.
Men of Reddit, what are the best things an attractive girl can do to earn more respect/be taken more seriously in the workplace?	Do your peers and boss feel you are as competent as they are? You should ask them and not just assume. 90% of people think they are above average.	> a guy in the meeting makes a similar suggestion (sometimes, the exact same suggestion) Can you make some of those suggestions in writing instead?
What's a sex dream you've had that you wish was real?	M Shadows is very yummy. I've had dreams about him, as well as Timothy Olyphant &amp; Tom Hiddleston. Tom Hiddleston &amp; M Shadows are my two celebrity crushes though.	I had a dream that Cersei from Game of Thrones made me go down on her. Jury is still out on that one.
What's the boldest sexual advance someone made on you and how did it work out?	I went to her house for dinner and she made a large pot of soup and gave me a bowl. I start eating it and I notice there's a hair in the soup so I pull it out of my mouth trying not to make a big deal out of it, and she say's "oh you found the hair?" I said, "Yeah, why's it in there." She goes, "It's one of my pubic hairs, I really like you Dennis." I thought, damn I never even thought of her romantically, but it was such a creative way to ask me out that I just had to say yes! Thought this thread was missing a wholesome story, so there you go. We're still together and this week is our 4 year anniversary!	It was New Year’s Eve and my gf and I were out at a nice lounge downtown. I was coming out of the bathroom as someone was coming in. They looked me up and down, smiled and winked, then nodded towards the empty bathroom with a raised eyebrow. It was a pretty clear invitation for an anonymous quickie. Unfortunately it was a dude. He looked handsome and sharp, and I was flattered, but very politely motioned back towards my gf sitting at the bar to let him know I was taken... and straight. He nodded with a smile and we went about our evening. The whole exchange was silent, but we understood each other perfectly.

Tall girls, how tall are you, how does it affect your daily life, relationships, etc?	As a 6'2" guy, I just wanna say this: I love you tall girls. Never let those shorties make you feel like you aren't the sexiest, most attractive and coolest girls in the world <3 :)	I'm 5'11". Growing up, I was always very self-conscious about being the tallest kid (let alone girl) in the room. I was called Sasquatch by some mean girls in high school. I developed a tendency to hunch to make myself smaller. I worried if I would ever find someone who likes my height. However, my fiancé is 5'10". He often complements my height ("I love how long you are" is a phrase he says often). He has really helped me feel more confident about my height.
Do you get turned on or grossed out by nude men?	Meh, sometimes. Depends on the mood I'm in. I definitely don't like seeing naked men in porn, it makes me feel icky.	Honestly, unless the man is my boyfriend, I'm pretty neutral. By that, I mean, if I'm watching a movie or something and there's a nude man, I don't suddenly get turned on. I might notice if he's attractive or not, but I'm not suddenly raring to go to have sex. In general, however, I'm not a visual person.
What did you learn about yourself from a failed relationship, and what change resulted from that?	she doesn't want an equal, she wants a captain. Women love up, not across and definitely not down. I tried to lift her up to my level and let her make some decisions in our relationship and she hated me for it. now i treat my women more like my first mate and they love it. Another way to look at it is im the king and she is my queen. You still treat her with respect and let her know she is important (first mates and queens are still highly ranked in their respectively) but the king always makes the final decision. tl;dr-women fucking love a man that acts like a captain/king/leader/etc.	I learned how insecure I was. I had no redeeming qualities as a partner. But the next couple of years were great as I focused on myself. I did a lot of growing and learning about just who I am. Really made me appreciate myself more and not completely look for happiness in someone else.
What is the most difficult thing you told your family/friends? How did they react?	I told my grandmother that I was raped (a week after it happened). She literally told me to get over it (using expletives). I ended up driving to a local park, crying, and pondering suicide. Needless to say, it didn't go over well.	I had to tell my parents that their youngest child (me) has cancer. That was the worst thing I ever had to do in my life. Worse than actually having cancer. They hugged me and said they'd take time off from work to come down to where I lived and be there for me after the surgery. The next day they went with me to my childhood doctor to get my medical history printed out. They were at my side when I told my brother and they were sitting next to my bed in the hospital when I woke up from the surgery. I will never forget that. And I will never be able to make up for what they went through during that time. I'll keep trying though. That was more than four years ago and I am fine now.
Those of you who picked the wrong career (for you), when did you realize you weren't on the right track?	I started working on arts during high school, hated it and switched next year. Now I wanna be a software engineer :]	I was a grocery store manager and was facing the reality that I was just a number to the company as opposed to an asset. That's how I treated my employees and was naïve to think that was how the company was supposed to treat me. Then one morning I go in to work and ended up watching 9/11 happen live on the TV in the office. I talked to an Army recruiter that week and put in my notice. After 15 years of loyalty the company didn’t try once to get me to stay. Not even an exit interview. I’m still in the Army. It has its ups and downs but my worst day in Iraq was still better than my best day working for them.
Has a girl ever done something that made you want to dump her "on the spot"?	Not a GF but I was talking to a chick at a bar and we were really hitting it off until Under Pressure by Queen came on. She said "I love Vanilla Ice!" Without saying a word I turned and walked away.	Screamed out "you gave me AIDS!!!" in the middle of a restaurant and broke down crying because she got sick three months into us dating. She believed all black people had aids. She went to the doctor, got an AIDS test, a few days later she told me it was just a sore throat and that she might of overreacted. She didn't even apologize.
Single women over 30, does dating get harder?	Does this person who told you this info have kids? Been divorced? Have a shitty personality? Is she ugly? Im 43 its not any different then when i was under 30. Might be because i have zero kids and dont want them and do not care if i get married. Im not horribly ugly and dont look 43. Men havent changed. They are still horn dogs who want and need a woman. They just dont try as hard at my age anymore cuz theres always masturbation or a desperate chic.	From my own dating and the experience of friends, I'd say it's having children that ups the difficulty, not ageing. I'm in my 30s and c.f. and haven't really noticed any difference at all, but my friends who are single mums (even if they haven't got to 30 yet) have a waaay harder time of it. Just the logistics alone of dating when you're a single parent can be a nightmare, let alone finding any decent dates.
Men of Reddit - How often do you receive compliments from your SO/women in general? And what might those compliments be? Does this affect you in any way?	I get being cute a lot, I like it for sure, but I want to be the hot guy! Cute is for puppies :P	My wife and I have been together for 11-ish years. Last night she said I was hilarious, and it's the first time I can remember her genuinely complimenting me in a long, long time. It made me feel better than I'd care to admit.
Ladies who look like you put a lot of effort in, but are actually very low maintenance, what are your tips?	Probably a lot of luck. I'm naturally pretty, or at least pretty enough for people to call me that. I make sure that I condition and shampoo my hair regularly, but when I'm going out, I'll only brush it and tie it up. My skin has always naturally been smooth, I guess I drink a lot of water, so that helps keep it clear.	Good skincare is more important than makeup skills. Healthy hair is more important than styling tools/products. If you don't feel like building an outfit or finding pants, just throw on a dress. A proper fit is more important than some people realize.
Have you ever felt too "ugly" to be in a sexual relationship?	Whoa. Please seek professional help and I say that in the kindest way I can. I'm guessing you're far prettier than you give yourself credit for - so what's going on? This makes me sad and I think your statement requires far more attention than input from Internet strangers. It worries me because no one else can love you until you learn to love yourself (warts and all, so to speak). This can be easily fixed! Things are not as bad as you may think they are! Hang in there, tootsie pop!	Yeah. I mean, I don't think I'm hideous or anything, but most of the time I can't wrap my head around the idea of someone actually wanting to fuck me.

I would never date a woman with children, is this a strange viewpoint?	I don't want kids at all personally. Not my own, not anyone else's. I find it interesting that of all the things males of today have given up in the name of "gender equality", they still insist on not wanting kids unless they come from their own loins. It's silly to me. That isn't what makes a man a father.	At your age, nothing wrong with that. As /u/nerdrowwilson1 stated, single moms in their 20s is an indication of poor decision making (not a universal rule, but a guideline). If you're still single as you get closer to my ago (40-ish), then you're gonna have to accept that single moms exist and cutting them out of your dating pool really cuts down on your pool size. My problem with single moms is they always say "kids come first". And I'm more than cool with that. Her responsibilities to her children is paramount in her life. But I don't want to take a back seat to a snot nosed little shit either. And there's nothing wrong with that too. We all have priorities.
How old are you, and what's something you recently learned about yourself?	I'm 21 and I recently learned that I'm far too involved in my job and my hobbies and myself to ever be suitable for a relationship.	27, and I learned two weeks ago that I'm gooey! I probably have been my whole life, but only realised now. Edit: I meant "gaaaaay" lol, but I'm keeping gooey

How have you improved your relationship communication?	My boyfriend and I have recently started trying to set time aside on Sunday nights to talk about anything bothering us. He prefers talking about issues as soon as he thinks of them, but I have a lot of difficulty having calm conversations unless I've had some time to sort out exactly how I'm feeling about something. It was his idea to start scheduling a time that we could both talk about our issues because the way we'd been going about it before had been putting me under a lot of stress. I really like it because if we don't have anything to talk about, it's just time that we can spend alone together away from his roommates talking about lighter, happier stuff.	One thing I have found really helpful is to work on my self-awareness. Why *am* I upset right now? What would help me deal with X or Y? Sometimes I will directly say those things to an SO. "I'm in a really bad mood because of work today, and I need you to please agree that everyone's stupid and annoying for a little bit." It's been very effective.
What's the difference between the girl you fuck and the girl you date?	The girl who fucks outside of a relationship (aka has FWB or fuck buddies) is not the girl I want a relationship with.	1. Guys (the ones interested in casual sex in the first place) tend to have lower standards for casual sex than they do for relationships, so attractiveness is one reason a girl might only be considered as a casual sex partner and not as a romantic option. 2. It's possible to have plenty of sexual interest in a girl but not want to date her due to personal incompatibilities, or a lack of romantic attraction. Even if the people spend time together fine in the context of a friend(s-with-benefits-)ship, there can still be personal incompatibilities that make the guy not think that a long-term committed relationship would work. 2. Sometimes a guy is at a point in his life where he's not looking for a relationship. It's a common excuse, but sometimes it's true. 3. Many guys specifically aren't interested in turning a casual sex arrangement into a relationship.
For those of you who are middle class, how has Obama Care effected your ability to afford health care?	From a non-American: Somebody please explain to me how Americans don't seem to understand that there is a significantly better way, IE regulating what medicine costs in the first place, leading to afforable socialized healthcare. Every other country in the developed world has social healthcare. You're standing alone in making health and well-being a fucking trade commodity. I'm currently battling cancer. I've had a surgery, two CT scans, maybe a dozen blood tests, countless appointments at the hospital, and I'm about to have a cycle of chemotherapy. At the end of it, I'll have paid $7 a day for it, and that's for the hospital parking lot. I don't have any health insurance, and I pay 12% income tax. *There is a better way.*	I am barely middle class, and I haven't been able to afford insurance or qualify for medicaid. I'm in the place where I'm too poor for one and too rich for the other.
I just turned 27, and I feel like I want run away and start over anew; a quarter-life crisis, I suppose. Has this happened to any of you guys? What have you done?	Start playing super smash bros melee competitively, Boston has got a great scene for it. Big tournament to watch this weekend too (CEO).	I'm only 24, but I quit my job, sold my shit, and went overseas about a year ago. What I can tell you for sure is that changing your environment doesn't necessarily change who you are or what's going on in your head. If you've got something in your mind that you need to get figured out, you have to deal with it, changing the scenery isn't just going to make that problem disappear. A lot of people have this fantasy where they run away to a new place and suddenly they're a whole new person. It's just not true. You can go anywhere on earth, you're still just you in that place.
What was the weirdest situation where you've gotten laid?	I got laid after getting arrested, processed, and released for a DUI that same night. I got busted while dropping my girlfriend (at the time) and her friends off. The girl I had sex with wasn't my girlfriend.	I'm Indian and from Canada. I went to visit my cousin in the US. We ended up hanging with his friends (mostly white people). I start talking in an Indian accent. We then went to a bar and I told her beer relaxes the muscles in my tongue and gets rid of my accent. Everyone else laughed and realized I was faking but she thought it was real. My cousin then tells her the truth and she gets mad at me. I go to apologize and give her a hug. We start making out and she takes me back to her place. She wants to have sex with me while i doing the Indian accent. It's not a sexy accent...
For those of you who asked for your S.O.'s father for his approval before you proposed, what did you say to him?	This practice is so out of date IMO. Sorry for the off topic answer, but he does not own his daughter. I should probably add that I hate my wife's father...	My father in law likes me a lot and we've always gotten along. We were at a family wedding (wife is Irish catholic, there are a *lot* of family weddings) and I took him aside and said I planned to propose and that I'd like his blessing. He hugged me and said I had it, and not to tell her mother or else everyone in the family would know by the end of the week.
What are your tips for being the hottest/most attractive (appearance wise) version of yourself?	For me: Don't eat things that lead to bloating or make you feel gross. Dairy, excessive fried foods, processed sugars, excessive alcohol all make me feel gross. When you feel gross, it shows. Keep your teeth, hair, and body clean. Minimal hair styling, if any. Let that curl go nuts. Minimal makeup, if any. Confidence and comfort are attractive, and I am profoundly uncomfortable with makeup on my face. So trying to "look pretty" is counterproductive. Clothes that fit well. Good skincare. Get (close to) enough sleep (as often as possible). Don't skip workouts too often. The exertion is good for the body. Good posture.	I feel the hottest on a regular day (say, just work and grocery shopping), when I'm wearing something that makes me look professional, smart, and like I have my sh*t together. Throw on a pair of sunglasses and I'm good to go. Daily I focus on skincare, drinking enough water, and practicing good self-care so I remain happy and confident.
"Nice girl syndrome" - I feel like I embody this completely. Is this something that's considered negative (story included)?	There's no such thing as "nice girl syndrome" with guys. There's "not as attractive as the other girl syndrome." Sorry, but it's true.	This is pretty much the stereotypical friend-zoned nice guy situation, except with a nice girl instead. I'll give you the same advice. It's interesting how niceness relates to and interacts with attraction and romance. In my opinion, niceness is not a negative itself, but often it's used to cover up (or it's just a mislabelling of) things that are negatives, like insecurity or desperation (usually the belief that you don't have anything else to offer, so you'll just be really nice). With that said, niceness is also not going to secure attraction by itself. Who becomes attracted to someone just because they were nice to them? Unless they also have problems with insecurity, not many people. Most people will say they want a nice person as a partner, but what they really mean is that they want an attractive person who's also nice. That's how I see niceness.
How can you tell if the girl you are seeing is loyal and won't cheat? What are some things you look for?	Okay, the SJWs on this page will have a field day with this, but: Does she have many female friends or is she mostly just together with other men? Chances are high that she's a cunt and other girls are seeing through her bullshit so they don't like to be together with her. Those girls also tend to have those male friends for attention or an occasional boredom-fuck. How often does she party? Does she get drunk often? I wouldn't say that a girl who loves to go out is a red flag, but it can sometimes be an indicator. How was her sexual past? Super high partner count or not? Did she cheat in another relationship before? None of these are dead-tell signs of course.	There's a really simple test you can do at home. Get some vinegar, get some baking soda. Then make a big clay volcano. Then while this is erupting, call your girlfriend to come see. If she's too busy sucking someone else's dick, she is disloyal.
What exactly is your strategy when eating pussy? Lick it like an ice cream? Stick your tongue as far as possible?	imagine you're bobbing for apples. but the water is bread dough and the apple is right at the bottom. just headbutt it and it'll work out.	I actually start off kissing it, softly blowing warm breaths, gentle probes with my tongue to warm her up. Once she flowing, I do what you said.
Those of you who primarily go to chain restaurants when you go out, why don't you hit up your local places?	I assume people that eat at chain restaurants on the regular are the same people who eat salted oatmeal for breakfast everyday. They also probably put catsup on their hotdogs. They should be treated like lepers.	They're safe bets. You know *exactly* what you're getting at a chain restaurant anywhere in the US. The local one-off places are hit or miss and sometimes have more limited menus, so they're a riskier choice for a date or group visit unless you already know the place.
How often do you catch people checking out your SO?	The GF - once in awhile, especially if we're hanging out with her other partners. ;) The BF - no clue. I'm still in starry-eyed NRE with him and don't notice anything but him when he's in the room.	I caught *myself* checking him out once... We were at Barton Springs and he'd gone to change back into his clothes. I was standing with my SIL and looked up and spotted this insane gorgeous dude. Huge muscles, tall, broad shouldered, Sandy brown hair, kinda douchey yellow muscle shirt. I leaned over to my SIL and was like 'damn he's hot...' and then as he got closer, 'oh shit, that's my husband!' In my defense, I'd never seen the shirt before. It was super douchey.
Guys who have hot ex(es), how do you actually feel about dating girls after that are an obvious "downgrade" in terms of looks?	My ex is a supermodel for a very famous clothing company. I've yet to see a woman as beautiful as her and we broke up a year ago. Although who she was as a person is not who I want to be with, I would be lying if I didn't compare who I date to that again. It's a difficult circumstance.	One of my best friends (a woman) has an ex who is preposterously good looking. When he was single, EVERY time I'd go out with him, whether it was a bar or a J. Crew, women (incredibly hot women, too) would approach him. She broke up with him but stayed friends and had a picture of him in her apartment. She started dating a guy who I was also friends with. We were all over at her apartment early on, and he saw the photo. He looked over at me and said, "Is this [insert his name]?" I said yes. His response? >Damn, I must be GREAT looking if she dated this guy. They're married now. His confidence about it was clearly a positive. Own it - he chose YOU.
What was your "Fuck, I need to turn my life around" moment?	Got up one morning and decided it had been a while since masturbating and having sex and i was gonna get a hooker. Dont regret it one bit but afterwards all i could think was that was great but deadliftings better. Gone from 80kg to 140kg in 3 weeks.	College drop out. Moved back to my parents place and would regularly sleep in until 6pm since I stayed up playing video games all night. One day my friend told me "if your true love could see how you live for 24hrs. What would she think?" That was a good kick in the ass.
What would you do if a girl tried to buy you a drink?	View her with immediate suspicion. She has an agenda. Women don't buy drinks. Women don't buy anything if they can avoid it, they get a man to buy it for them.	Tell her that she doesn't need to roofie me to get into my pants but drink the whole thing anyways.
AskWomen, what's your favorite way to live frugally?	I don't live frugally, I spend all my money and I own a credit card. It's dangerous. But I do attempt to look for all the specials, when I shop online I go to the sale section and scroll each page about 10 times. I do attempt to avoid full priced items if I can. I like to get more for my buck yanno?	I live in a tiny apartment. It's 460 square feet. I could afford something bigger, but why should I? For just me, it's got enough room for my stuff - plus, it's less space to clean!
Do you have anxiety that leads you to procrastinate because you fear that "it won't work out well when I do it"? If so, how have you combatted this (what helps)?	This probably sounds dumb but the only thing that helps is completely organizing and cleaning my workspaces or things that I will need to use. Like, before I can start any crochet project for instance I have to top down clean my apartment, feed the cats, sort my yarn etc etc. Its annoying but its the only thing that stops all the anxiety and worry about being a failure or generally sucking.	I've dealt with this for a long time and I've found that it's always 20x easier once you've actually started. I also tell myself "be shameless" and basically remind myself that the greatest creations & discoveries take courage. In my head, it always feels like a big deal...
How do you deal with female friends/colleagues who get too 'handsy'?	Many female friends of mine are quite handsy and I hate being touched except by people I want to have sex with. I specially hate it when it comes unannounced like a surprise hug or kiss on the cheek or whatever. It makes my spine shiver. I found a quote from a film to be excellent. " What?! are we dating? Back off..... " They soon learn to ask for permission to hug.	Okay, she's 18/19 so she probably really needs this job and the money, so you tell her ONCE that you dont like being touched and that her behavior is inappropriate. If she ever does this again, you go to HR (or directly to your boss/manager, I dont know how big that company is) and file a complaint.
"Men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100% of them." - What are your thoughts on this?	Mod Note: Locked for rampant rule-breaking. Far too many of you are derailing, invalidating, and debating. Please feel free to report rule breaking. There's an awful lot of it.	Mod Note: Locked for rampant rule-breaking.

What's your opinion on mandatory military service?	I support mandatory national service, it worked for the U.S. before WW2. Mandatory military service though... that can be problematic.	I'm a former (US) Army Captain and 2x Company Commander. While I can definitely see some benefit to mandatory military service, I'd take 60 Soldiers who wanted to be in the Army over 120 Soldiers who are only there because they have to be any day of the week.
Have you guys ever faced rejection from a girl that you were great friends with? How did you handle it?	I stopped talking to her, blocked her on social media, and cut her out of my life. I don't do friendzones. BUY\-BYE	Happened to me in high school. Befriended a girl in freshman year, but grew to have feelings for her. I told my friend about my feelings a bit after the start of sophomore, but she didn't feel the same way. I ended up avoiding her afterwards because I couldn't deal, which ended up hurting her, and we went through HS ignoring each other's existence. A similar thing happened in college, but I just kept my mouth shut about it since nothing good would've come of it. I just created some distance between us.
Have you ever went to a bar alone? How was the experience?	I pretty much only go to bars alone. It's so much less pressure. I can sit quietly, drink, and watch TV. Or I can mingle and meet new women without the pressure of getting turned down and getting made fun of by your friends.	I started going to a bar alone, then after a while I got to know the bartenders and other regulars, and I wasn't alone anymore.
What's a popular food that you just don't really like/can't stand?	I come to askwomen to see how the other half lives, and I'm met with you ladies just shittin' on all the best foods.	I prefer salad without any dressing. Like just raw leaves. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Also, I wish I liked jalapeño :( I'm tired of the emotional trauma that comes from biting into what you think is a raisin bagel only to find jalapenõ :(
What was your "wow, I really don't give a fuck anymore" moment?	Mine is going to be boring, because this is reddit, and reddit is flooded with trans women, but when I realized I could never fit cis-norms and said, eh, whatevs. Not that this fixes physical dysphorias, it doesn't, but it certainly makes going out the door easier when I don't care if you know I'm trans or not. And honestly, I've come to like (love?) being trans because as a gender pariah, I have the freedom of a pariah. I'm damned either way, so I might as well choose my personal happiness 100% then - not a freedom many have in life.	I watch a lot of movies (>3 a month). Before I used to make plans to see them with people. It was such a fucking hassle and people kept showing up late but its a big fucking deal for a 2-2.5 hour movie. So i stopped asking people and started going to movies by myself. One of the weirdest best decisions i ever made. Super liberating, i enjoy myself more, i can go anytime and get on with my day.
Women who went through with the wedding despite having doubts, how did things turn out?	Perhaps this is very jaded of me, but I often think it's pretty normal for marriages- especially 1st marriages- to fail and that it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Like I often think when I hear stories like these that even if you hadn't gone through with that particular marriage, you probably still would've gone through another marriage that very well might've ended in divorce? Just because of society's expectations & people not being ready to commit for the rest of their life. And maybe your doubts would've been different & maybe your problems would've changed, but the outcome would be the same. I don't mean to be condescending. I wonder if anyone here who did end up divorced feels the same way? Or do you now believe marriage at a particular age is wrong? Or is it really just about \*who\* you get married to?	Really good, actually. I realized that it’s normal to have doubts, even if the guy is super great. It’s a huge commitment and it turned out very nicely for me. He’s an imperfect husband but he’s considerate and kind and we’re devoted to making things work.
Attractive men of reddit who are dating a girl who is not considered attractive what’s your take on it?	I and a few of my friends have dated non-attractive girls before. Usually we were in a dry spell and needed to get out of the funk, but sometimes it was because less attractive girls put out easier and are lower maintenance. And for some my friends, they're hot but have no game so they have to settle for less.	I've often dated women who are not conventionally attractive. At the same time, you'd be surprised how malleable people's views of beauty are. If you treat someone who is beautiful on the inside as though they are beautiful on the outside, they start to see themselves that way, and so do other people. Obviously there are limits to this, but I'll take the confident yet goofy girl with a big heart, over the hot girl with no depth and high expectations, any day.
Would you prefer to be able to run at 50 mph or fly at 10 mph?	>Would you prefer to be able to run at ~~50 mph~~ 80km/h or fly at ~~10 mph~~ 16km/h? I was confused by the outdated an backwards measurement, so FTFY. Or rather, FTFEveryonewho'snotfromtheUS.	So the way I see it, All you have to do is fly STRAIGHT UP and use a wing suit to fly waaaayyy faster using aerodynamics and gravity .
Ladies who got in shape, what did you do to get there?	Work out. Anyone who tells you that there is any way to get in shape that doesn't involve working out is lying to you. There is no magic pill. There is no magic diet. No magic milkshake. Losing weight is not the same as getting in shape. If anyone ever wants to get in shape, they have to work for it. So that's what I do. The first time, my motivation was a screaming drill sergeant. The second was just because I wanted to be stronger and healthier. As for diet, don't eat less, just eat better. And definitely never fast. To work out effectively, you must take in enough calories. Calories are good. You need calories. They're what fuel workouts. Just make sure those calories come with the nutrition needed and aren't just empty calories. And keeping a regular meal schedule (no fasting!) keeps your metabolism balanced.	Gradual changes. First, I added fresh vegetables to my diet and cut out sugary beverages. Once I got used to one diet change, I'd add another. Over the course of a year, I completely changed my diet and lost 35 pounds. Then I started working out and exercising regularly, starting slow with bike rides and yoga and working up to distance running and weight training. I've kept the weight off for ten years.
If you could be 100% honest with her right now, and she'd not feel any hurt at all, what who would it be and what would you say?	My friend, I'll tell her that she is not an introvert like she would like to say on social media often. She has a squad of friends they travel often even internationally eats out at public restaurants and so on, my brother is a introvert, he struggles to connect to people at any level but he is a terrific guy. I would tell her that I care for her and that if she needs help there are plenty of licensed mental health professionals who would be much helpful than the Tiktok influencers she follows about introvert challenges	"You're really good at making yourself unhappy, and much of it is avoidable. You're my friend so I really don't like seeing you unhappy. You should go back to therapy and work on treating yourself better."
My roommate and I are starting a "Problematic Book Club" where we explore texts that are controversial for one reason or another. What's your favorite problematic book?	Any book which expresses any form of idea could be seen as problematic to someone. *Edit: The downvotes don't make this any less true.*	James Frey's *A Million Little Pieces* belongs on your list. It was published as a memoir of the author's life as a drug addict and his experiences in rehab. The story of pain and inspirational redemption landed Frey an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's TV show and the book climbed to the number one position on the New York Times bestseller list for 15 straight weeks. Then it turned out the book was a fabrication. Many of the scenes never happened. It wasn't a memoir at all. The controversy was so bad Random House and Amazon gave people refunds for the book. Frey's promising career never recovered. It's still a good read. You just have to take into account that the author was in jail for just a couple hours, for instance - not the 67 days detailed in the text.
Men who are happy with their significant others, what is a flaw of your partner and why is it not a deal breaker in the end?	Kitten is very sadistic and cruel towards people, in an almost casual sort of way. She's the sort of chick who you'll tell you're going into surgery, and she'll mention that some people just don't wake up from anesthesia, or that some people are awake and alert throughout the surgery, feeling everything but unable to move, and isn't that terrible? She's a woman always ready with the needle, to poke and prod and twist it in the flesh of the helpless and the down trodden. This isn't a deal breaker to me because i'm the exact same way, and we make a good team.	Mine repeated every single line that was said of a conversation if she's telling a story, that shit fries me
What do you dislike the most about online dating?	The fact that it's so dangerous. Dan the cute and cuddly may very well end up being Dan the rapist or Dan the murderer. This is a risk in normal dating too, but I find red flags easier to detect in person. Creeps can't hide their true selves as well in real life as they can online. Meeting strangers from the internet feels like an incredibly bad idea to me.	As an introvert, I felt like online dating had a lot of positive aspects - first and foremost that I didn't have to go out and be social. I know a lot of women get inappropriate messages but that only happened to me once - and it was simply "you're going to hell" (because I'm an atheist). Other than that, I have to say that I found it to be a positive experience overall. My SO and I met that way and we've been together almost 5 years now.
Tall women of AskWomen, what are the pros and cons of being tall and how have they impacted your experience as a woman?	As an already tall teenage girl predicted to be 5’10-11, guys get intimidated. I’m bi though and girls don’t really. My current bf is 6’2 so we have a 5 inch height difference and it’s decent. I think guys are more intimidated by my intelligence etc than my height in the scheme of things.	I’ve found guys to be intimidated by it. Even though I personally have no issue dating people shorter than me, I had an ex in particular who very much believed I would never go for him because he was shorter than me. I hear it constantly that guys wont date a girl taller than them even though I also hear men say women don’t like short guys? The only other con would be clothes, whether it’s pants, dresses, skirts, or shoes, good luck finding anything. It won’t be long enough or come in your size (I wear a size 11 shoe). Other than that, it’s just whatever. Makes some sports easier.
What thing does your wife/girl friend hate about her body that you find attractive? What do you hate about your body that she finds attractive?	Something that I have always been captivated about my ex-girlfriends and women in general, was that hair. That long, flowing, thick, cascading hair. Gorgeous.	My wife has the most beautiful smile but when anyone takes a photo of her she smiles with her mouth closed. I've told her repeatedly but she doesn't believe me. As for me, I think I look like a troll but my wife doesn't seem to agree.
What do you firmly believe now that you did not when you were younger?	You're not a true adult until you are at least 25. Science tells the same but I didn't really care in my early 20s. Now looking back at 31, turns out they were right.	Money, attractiveness, confidence, and networking are important to getting ahead in life. I grew up poor and thought that simply being smart and working hard was good enough. Then I went to an elite college where I still didn't care about my appearance or socializing. Now that I put more care into my appearance and make conscious social decisions, people seem to respect me and like me more. Of course working hard and being intelligent matter a lot. But combined with good social etiquette and a little makeup, you can make a better impression on the people you want to develop relationships with.
What’s the difference between a woman you’d fuck and a woman you’d wife?	Women want the relationship first, then they decide to have sex. Men want to kick the tires sexually, and then commit. It's a function of what the gender is risking. Cutting down sexual options? Only for someone who's sexually compatible and worth it as a person. Taking the risk of disease and pregnancy? Only for someone who can pay child support and will be a nice guy about it.	Would Fuck: * Seems good in bed. * Looks hot/my type * Is willing Would Wife: * Seems like the kind of person I could be honest with. * Could trust. * Makes me smile/happy. * Cares about me. * Could spend a lot of time with. Of course, it's best to find a woman who fits both categories.
Men of reddit, what mantras do you use to help you get through life?	If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body. If I kill her, I won’t be able to hide the body.	"Don't let your mistakes compound." - everyone fucks up. But man, if you fuck up, don't use the fuck up as an excuse to keep fucking up. Shit can unravel *real* fast. Take a breath, regroup, and come back strong.
I am an East Asian guy dating a White girl who is a weaboo, how can I talk to her about how uncomfortable it makes me?	TIL girls are into you because your Asian wtf, remember the days that girls weren't into Asians ? Pepperidge farm remembers	I don't think you are giving enough context to get great advice. Is it making you feel uncomfortable because she is fetishizing you and only like you because you are Asian? Is it uncomfortable because she may have stereotyped you and falsely thought you would have shared interests as her? Either way, imo just be honest, articulate, and direct about what is it that's bothering you.
Men of reddit, what are some Fashion 101 class tips that every man should know ( regarding how to dress and so on..) ?	That those kinds of fashion 101 tips are not rules, they're just guides for people who don't know about fashion so they can play it safe. If someone is not following those guidelines that doesn't automatically mean their outfit is trash.	* Buy clothes that fit well, and accentuate the good parts of your figure. * Choose established color pallettes. Nothing wrong with having a limited color selection. * Shoes are part of the outfit. They should also match your belt. There's nothing wrong with having shoe options.
Do you feel like your SO is better than other people objectively, or do you think it's purely your personal preference?	Behind every wife is a trail of ex-boyfriends who are sick of her shit. Just because she's perfect for you, doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone.	She has certain traits that i place a lot of value into; so to me she's superior. But that doesn't mean everyone places the same value on the same traits. So I guess from my perspective it's both, but to everyone else it's a matter of preference
How do you cope with being "just another guy" in the modern dating scene?	Why be "just another guy" when you can be the most incredible man she's ever met? Don't put yourself down before you've even started.	You're just another guy, but she's also just another girl. Also, as someone who seriously dates multiple people, I think it's pretty shitty that she wasn't open about that with you. I don't think that's necessarily the norm, and I wouldn't accept that behavior from a potential partner.
Those of you who use anti-wrinkle cream, does it actually work ? How often and how long do you have to use it before seeing a result ?	I use ponds rejuvinate. It's not expensive. It was not an immediate result. But my forehead wrinkles are gone and the bottle has lasted years after daily use. I started using it because an old lady friend of mine complained that her sister looked ten times better than her and she only put ponds on her face. Shrug.	Retinol night cream has been shown to be effective, and sunscreen is of course great for day. Moisturizer is of course just great for skin in any situation. Anything else is marketing. The $300 moisturizer won’t do anything g the $10 moisturizer doesn’t do. The most important part is to use it.
Women that've experienced a healthy relationship and have also had abusive partners in the past, what differences did you notice between the two?	A toxic or selfish person will mostly or completely be interested in what makes them happy, a health relationship they'll care about making you happy and that will make them happy in turn because they love you. Respecting boundaries, no meaning no, not insulting you, not physically harming you, not gaslighting you making you doubt yourself or telling you no one else would put up with you/love you/treat you as well as they do/you can't do better/you're stupid/not smart/not good enough kind of crap. You should never hear any of that in a healthy relationship. A healthy partner believes in you, helps you to grow, pushes you when you need it but not in a harmful way. Supports you, is giving and not just taking.	My ex would constantly criticize me, while my current partner encourages me to be myself. I think that’s the biggest difference I’ve noticed. I was also constantly making excuses for my ex. Now I let my SO’s actions speak for themself.
Do you think lottery winners should be allowed to remain anonymous?	No. The kidnappers work very hard to coordinate and carry out a snatch-and-grab, and to get a decent ransom in return. The lottery winner, by contrast, only has to buy a ticket and fill out some paperwork. It's totally one-sided in their favor!	There was a kidnaping and murder in Australia of the son of a lottery winner, Graeme Thorne. At the time the newspaper not only identified the winner but published his address. This case made very sure that lottery winners could remain anonymous in the future.
What sexual act will you never perform (again), and why?	Crossdressing as well team domming... I hated the pseudo lesbian crap because those ball crushinh underwear are like getting kicked in the nads all day. We tied down this big dude and "served the matriarchy" over "some freaking dude". We took turns with it. And on shark week, we took a trip to brokeback. The crossdressing was pretty... Brian Molko... but could dress sluttier.	The one where she says "let's role play as sea creatures!" and proceeds to act like a starfish. edit: i was an elephant seal and a sea cucumber.
What frustrates you the most about the dating world?	It's really, really difficult for me not to rant about women's hypocrisy and unrealistic expectations about dating. That's what annoys me the most, but it's a really touchy subject. "*sigh* Why cant I find a nice guy for once." "What about this guy I know?" "Mmm..too overweight/short." *throws hands in the air, rolls eyes and walks away*	I feel like, as a guy, I'm expected to do most of the work -- at least to get things started -- even though I probably care less than most women about being in a relationship in the first place.
Losing my libido, girlfriend taking it personally, what do?	See a doctor. You might be suffering from clinical depression or maybe just ED. Edit: yeah, sure. This comment telling someone experiencing sudden onset symptoms is somehow controversial. Guys. When anything rapidly and negatively changes in you, you should seek a doctor.	Stopping in to suggest maybe it's the time of year? If you're in a place that's not warm, you can be low on vitamin D. (Pun not intended). Lots of people are Vitamin D deficient in the winter. Low Vitamin D could cause low testosterone. Might be worth looking into because most people that are deficient don't know it. Could also explain why you're tired. Or it could just be normal fatigue.
What do you find attractive in women that others may not?	I like smaller boobs. Like B cup is perfect When tits get too big I think they look gross undressed. And time DESTROYS big boobs.	When I see questions like this I don't feel I find anything out of the ordinary attractive. I'm a simple guy with simple needs.
How would you react to a guy friend of your girlfriend having a crush on her?	The holding hands, and arms around her. Even carrying her to bed are all within the boundaries of a best friend. However, the fact they've already slept together changes everything. They're clearly attracted to each other and have no boundaries between them. I hate to break it to you but odds are she's already cheated on you with him. I'm attracted to psychos, it almost always ends badly. Don't be like me. You won't like the normal people if you stick with her too long.	"needed help getting to her bed" mmmmhmmmmm. Woman here, was fully prepared to read something innocuous about a harmless crush. This? Fuck no.
What is the shittiest apology you've ever received?	He broke up with me abruptly over the phone and then shrugged at me the next day when i questioned him before class.	A coworker secretly recorded me and then said he was sorry he made a "tactical error" during the meeting with our boss. It was the closest I've ever come to physically attacking someone.
What would you do if you weren't afraid?	I would start a panty washing service for all the hot moms I work with. There all busy after work. Taking kids to soccer games and other things that take up there time. I. Sure the last thing they want to do is laundry. I would be thrilled to make a few extra bucks washing there un mentionables	I'd spend a lot more time walking around at night on my own. I love it when there's no harsh light, the streets are quiet and if I'm lucky I can see the whole night sky stretching for billions of lightyears before me.
Women who are biologically unable to have their own kids, but still strongly desire to have kids, how do you cope?	Coming from someone who is adopted, it's so hard for me to hear all the women on this thread who think adopting is any different than raising a child who is biologically your own. What is so important about having a child be biologically your own? Is it that the kid looks like you? I can't think of any reason other than that so please enlighten me.	My mom couldn't have kids (due to damage caused by an old-school IUD. Yikes!) and eventually ended up at adoption. She is my mom in every sense of the word. I don't know how she feels about it, but I'm pretty sure she's "over it" in terms of any feelings of not being a mom, or missing out in some way. But she's also just not emotional, so YMMV. I have an urge to have my own biological kids, because I never had people close to me with my same biological quirks, etc. But, if I can't, I don't think I'll be heartbroken for long. Adoption really isn't a consolation prize, especially for the kids who get adopted. It's a viable road to parenthood.
Sleep talkers, what's the funniest or most embarrassing thing you've said while sleeping?	Not sleep talking and not me, but the guy I'm seeing gets handsy when he falls asleep. It's not all the time though. I usually wake up or am already awake when this occurs. So sometimes when I realize he's asleep I'll stop but sometimes it continues. It's usually really good sex! Not nearly as funny, or at all funny, like most everyone else's! Thank you for all the laughs :)	Girlfriend sleep talks with the best of them. My favorite one was when I slid into bed about an hour after she had already fallen asleep, and I put my hand on her shoulder, and she mumbled "Can you please let go of the Facebook icon?" I asked what she said and she repeated it. So I took it off her shoulder and placed it on her hip. She said "Can you take your hand off of Microsoft word?" I took my hand off of her and she nodded sleepily. Then a minute later so woke up, or so I thought, and looked at me and said "hold on, I need to compile myself." That's the night I found out she was a computer.
What were some irreversible changes that happened to your body after pregnancy?	My cervical opening is now elliptical 🤷🏼‍♀️ I have much thinking nicer hair on my head, sparse body hair bigger boobs and a ton of stretch marks. My heart feels bigger 🥰	Breast shape, nipple shape/colour, my metabolism was shot and has never recovered, obviously stretch marks, vaginal scarring from birth interventions, foot size, constant back pain, and some change in hair distribution pattern on my body.
What's something you never thought you'd have to explain to an adult?	That if you don't contribute financially, you better pick up some slack in your house so the breadwinner does not come home from a long work day to a disgusting house and "What's for dinner?" Tl; dr: I got a divorce last year.	My friend didn't understand why his microwave wouldn't toast bread. As a person who grew up cooking a lot it made no sense, but he had no idea that he needed a totally different appliance to make toast happen. The boy sells real estate and makes a boat load of money, is great at his job and fun to be around but NEVER learned to cook anything. We went and got him a slice toaster, that loads from the top. He jumped when the toast popped out and was so happy. Everyone who came over that night was offered toast.
Ladies who in their mid 20s were afraid of never finding love: have you eventually found it despite your fears, or did you overcame the fears first, and then found him? How old were you at that time?	My case was a little different. I didn't date until I was 25, but I knew I wasn't ready yet. When I was ready, I put myself out there and met people. I met my boyfriend through online dating. And I met my girlfriend through mutual friends.	In my 20s I was always worried I'd never find anyone, I'm 38 now and still haven't found anyone, so I was correct.
I'm 23 and my dad just died suddenly, what do I do?	I was in your position in 2006. Same. First step is toughen up and show up to stand next to mom and bury your Dad with full honour. You can think about supporting mom later. One problem at a time.	"I forgot to call the night before he died" Sounds like you called often. Good for you. Stop with the guilt. Dad will appreciate the help you're about to give Mom. Get to it.
What do you want to humblebrag about today?	My boyfriend is actually the hottest and most amazing guy I've ever met, and he's also incredible in bed, and he's just really awesome and smart and funny. Girls always check him out or get crushes on him, but he loves me and he's loyal to me and I can't believe I ended up with such a catch. I'm so insanely proud to be with him. I hope I marry him someday because I can't imagine my life with anyone else.	After being laid off, I received 3 job offers in a week. The one I ended up accepting is a 16% raise, more responsibility, better hours and in a lower cost of living city. I'm also continuing to get requests for interviews. I received 3 interview requests after accepting my job. It's a nice ego boost to be so wanted.
What advice do you have for girls that are a bit jealous of better looking girls?	1) Get fitter. Are all your friends at 18% bodyfat? Because otherwise, there's work they could be doing. 2) Dress better. Get better hair and makeup. These things matter a lot. 3) Don't make your self-worth all about how you look. Develop a personality and become successful in your career. These things matter a lot more for happiness in the long run, and even if you're the hottest woman in the world at 22, by 32 you will not be anymore. That's what I'd tell them, anyway. Maybe that's why nobody complains to me about this kind of shit anymore.	You're extremely susceptible to some douchebag just saying what you want to hear (that you're really much prettier than her) to get into your panties.
guys who are afraid to get into a relationships ? what makes you afraid ?	Some **psycho bitch** who appears normal, however threatens to bruise herself and call the police reporting I did it to her (we all know who the police and court would believe). Or even better, she's mad at you and falsely accuses you of rape. Even if you are found innocent in court, the mere allegation would have destroyed your professional reputation (especially if you are a medical doctor, lawyer, or professor) and subject you to public scrutiny from your friends, family and local news. Relationships are unsafe legally for men.	I wouldn't say I'm afraid. Fatigued, perhaps. Relationships these days are just too difficult. You can't count on anything to be predictable or sure. The standards are constantly being redefined and the relationships lines of do/don't are always moving, when everything is under scrutiny for offense or relationship power dynamics. I'm just tired of trying to prove myself as a decent and stable person who wants to be a good companion with equal give and take when that's just not good enough anymore.
What belief do you hold that is completely unreasonable, but you refuse to change your opinion?	**In this thread:** Question: "What's your unreasonable belief?" Answers: *Gives actual answer to the question.* Replies: "Woah! You realise that's totally unreasonable, right?"	**In this thread:** Question: "What's your unreasonable belief?" Answers: *Gives actual answer to the question.* Replies: "Woah! You realise that's totally unreasonable, right?"
Distinguished ladies of AskWomen: what kind of personal care or health habits are you now glad you developed or dropped in your twenties?	Had stopped overeating and had removed meat, dairy, and white rice, pasta, and bread from my diet. I don't go to the gym regularly, so I have to make it up in my diet. I'll occasionally have them, but only when I am going out to eat with friends, otherwise, you'll never find these things in my grocery list. Found that this had stopped a lot of bloating. and I've feel like I've been the most thinnest and confident in all of my life. Regardless, my body could be more toned and less pudgier if I start going to the gym more regularly, but I feel pretty comfortable with myself right now!	Using sunscreen even when it's not sunny out, doing cool down stretches after working out, and putting the lotion on the skin (I don't want to get the hose again).
What fashion trend (for women or men) are you impatiently waiting to come back into style?	Nice roomy stone washed dad jeans - like Levis 560s. White leather tennis shoes. Gray or dark red Champion Sweatshirts or College alma mater sweat shirts or New England Patriots sweatshirts. New England Patriots boxer shorts Black belt and a nice New England Patriots fanny pack to hold my wallet, phone and the digital picture frame with the 300 pictures and the 17 second Gif I have of the time I met Tom Brady. Edit: also the banana hammock swimsuit for men. So *liberating*. Men will truly feel empowered if they ever come back in.	The 90s are back but I can't find any of the chunky shoes I used to wear back then. I'm waiting for stores to fill up on chunky Oxfords again.
If you have every been homeless, what was your experience like?	Was homeless for 5 or 6 months. I've said it before and I'll say it again now: Being homeless isn't hard. Being poor is hard, and made harder by being homeless. My experience wasn't bad. I had a job, slept in my car. Stayed late for the internet and a cafeteria food. Drove to Walmart at night to sleep. Woke up and hit the gym for workout and shower. Easy peasy. Plus, I show up first, leave last, looks good. Bought a house, got promoted. I recommend being homeless with a job.	I have been homeless, some days my friend offered me a couch to stay on, most days not.. I was an addict, so no one really wanted me in their home. Some nights I would stay at a bench, sometimes I would break into abandoned buildings. Hunger was usually not a problem, I was high all the time and I really couldnt eat. Some nights I was scared, some nights I was calm. It really depended whenever I got my dose or not. But when I missed I had paranoia, I was freaking out and I didnt know what to do. Everything seemed hopeless. Ive been sober now for two years, and I dont ever wanna go back.
Women who have been in emotionally but not physically abusive relationships, are you able to talk about it? When did you realize it was abuse?	I didn't figure it out until it crossed the line into physical abuse. It took a year or two to really talk about it and understand how horrid emotional abuse is versus physical abuse. Broken bones heal, broken psyches don't ever go back to normal. Unfortunately he now uses the same abusive tactics with our daughter and I'm at a loss on how to protect her and I from him. The courts basically say that unless she gets a concussion or other reportable physical injury he can do whatever he wants.	Really, I didn't realize until I was out of the relationship. While in it ... I just realized I couldn't take it anymore. I even absolve him of intent to abuse -- he was just a critical, negative person. But when I said "that hurts me" and his consistent response was "it shouldn't hurt -- you're too sensitive -- get over it" or "that's what you get", then ... that was a problem.
How unapproachable is the hijab?	If I knew you personally I wouldn't care at first, but then id point out that it looks like a head tissue condom. In the street? Nah, I wouldn't even bother, it kinda makes you invisible in my book.	To be honest, it's very unapproachable in terms of dating. I will be as friendly to you as anyone else, however I will never consider asking you out because I view it as a waste of time due to cultural incompatibility
When do you feel the most beautiful?	When I'm carrying something really, really heavy. Seriously! I asked someone else, and they said "When you're explaining something science-y and you're totally in the zone about it."	Just before bed when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE IS AROUND TO SEE ME LOOKING SO BEAUTIFUL. *Goddamnit*. Not even kidding here.
You are trying to fall asleep and suddenly your brain thinks of that really embarrassing moment from when you were a kid. What is it?	Fine here's one, one my first day of kindergarten I was in a class with rowdy kids before class started and I just kind of sat in my chair where the teacher said to go as she tried to calm the other kids. I was hungry so I pulled out my lunchables and almost began to eat it before the teacher grabbed it and taped up the seal and said that it wasn't lunchtime. I think the other kids didn't care but I was weirded out how she taped it up and confiscated it, then around lunchtime I ate basically a taped up luncheable.	That time my parents gave me a really stern talking to about masturbating in the backyard tree house... because the neighbors saw me.
Seeing your first pair of breasts in real life, how good was it?	I was like 12 and this girl was flashing another dude. Her tittys were very tubular and pointed in opposite directions. I've seen many many tits in my life and those are still the worst pair I have ever seen.	If I'm gonna be truly honest. Seeing them is nice. But the coolest thing I did was touch one. I like to look at a nice pair. But mostly I just wanna lay my head on her chest and just breathe. If its all good, I might just relax and take a quick 20 min nap.
For men who've dated girls significantly taller than them, what was that like?	I always had an erection when she started to kiss me abruptly because I am sexually submissive so all our interaction was subby to me	It's really no big deal. Negatives: You have to stand on your toes to kiss her. Positives: You can look at her breasts all night and it doesn't look creepy. Yeah, that's about it.
Does a woman being interested in you make her more attractive?	Yup, this is why more women should go after guys instead of sitting back. You can probably overshoot what you would get by just sitting back.	Am I at least neutral on her or her appearance? Then yes. If I think she's unattractive, no level of her interest is going to break that threshold.
[Serious] Married women of reddit, how did your maid of honor handle your bachelorette party? What did you do? Did you enjoy it?	I didn't have a bachelorette party. My fiancé and I went on a date the night before and partied together. It was perfect for us.	My friend was the MOH for her sister and set up a bridal themed scavenger hunt throughout her hometown. The girls were split into teams and had to find everything on the list and bring it to the final location. At the end was a spa retreat, and they got their nails done and blowouts. Ended the night by going out to dinner all done up from the spa, and having a big sleepover at one of the bridesmaid's homes with a little champagne and cake. Low key, has a little glitz and glam to it, and can be perfect for this size group!
How many of you guys struggle with loneliness and how do you cope with it?	Well... First I remember I am a man. Then I stop being a little bitch. Step 1. Identify the problem Step 2. Investigate causes Step 3. Formulate a plan and action it Step 4. Review, refine and repeat. If your "friend" walks around thinking like a little bitch people will not want him in their life. Use the steps above. Get out of the comfort zone and then you will stop being a little bitch.	I don't, honestly. I usually have no problem being lonely, it's just when I'm being reminded of my loneliness that it starts to hurt. But it happens infrequently enough for me to not have a way of coping with it.
What podcasts are you listening to?	Ignorant philosophy Joe rogan Adam Corolla & dr drew show Bill burr Ari Shaffir skeptic tank The bone zone podcast Ted hour Stuff you should know	- Death, Sex & Money - Freakonomics Radio - Hello Internet - Lets Make Mistakes Together - On Being - Rooster Teeth Podcast - Stuff You Should Know - The Art of Charm - The Co-optional Poscast - Think Again - Waking Up with Sam Harris I also used to listen to - Cortex - TED Radio Hour - The Patch
Men of Reddit, what is the most touching thing that you've ever experienced or witnessed?	Sorano Hanako's moment of catharsis in Hoshi no Samidare. (Manga.) Where she reveals the name of her ability. That is a powerful arc.	I was driving home from college one day with my ex. While i am on a busy roadway i notice a duck going to cross the road. I looked at the oncoming car that wasn't slowing down. The duck tried to fly away, but got tagged by the car. I thought it must be dead. But it tried to stand up. I immediately pulled my car to the side and picked him up gently. I drove to 4 different animal hospitals in the area to find out they were all closed. He died 15 minutes later. My ex and I both cried. I am happy to have showed him some compassion in his final moments. We laid him to rest at a tranquil river.
How common is it for women to never want children?	As someone who actually want kids, I think it’s hard to find someone in my age group (early 20s) who even likes kids. Whenever I talk about kids, I’m met with hostility online, anger irl. It’s getting ridiculous.	Don’t come to “askwomen” much but tonight I did and this question has hit me solid. I am 43. I knew at 12 I did not want children. Did not know why, but just knew I didn’t have that THING that a lot of girls and women have that say I WANT TO BE A MOTHER! Magically married a man that agrees. Endured YEARS of my 20s with people saying I would regret it. But ultimately I think it is a common thought and the rest of our “life” (ie family, friends etc) guilt you into questioning yourself. My entire life revolves around kids, just not my own. ALSO, I am always terrified to post anything on here because I am not edgy and clever.
When were you most an asshole to someone you've dated?	My current relationship, I treat her quite rough especially sexually. I pretty much force myself on her pretty much everyday to the point where we only have sex when I want it, I regularly ignore her needs both sexually and physically. We also have the same type of sex in the same position every single day, I find it pretty boring and I don't know if she likes or not mainly because she doesn't talk to me at all for some reason even though we've been together for years. Idk why, sometimes I feel as this could be a result of my mistreatment as I can be quite abusive at times, but in the end I feel this connection to her, not just emotional but also physical and I am proud to call her my left hand.	i feel pretty bad about my second gf. i just up and dumped her one day because i wasn't attracted anymore and didn't see it going anywhere. thing is, i never told her why. i just asked her to meet up and she was crying. i bought her a drink and some food, hugged her, said sorry and left. she was so into me. and i just wasn't. could have did that better.
Is your current SO the best sex you've ever had? If not is it ever awkward in your relationship?	No, and no. I figure that life is too short to settle for amazing sex and a lousy relationship -- my priorities are apparently different than yours.	Yep. He wasn't, at first. But he's also the first guy that I've felt comfortable being completely honest with what I enjoy, and his needs are compatible with mine. I'm never ashamed to share something new I'd like to try, and if it doesn't work for us, we just move on. It's amazing.
Guys, what are your "woman being really inappropriate and borderline sexually harassing me" stories?	I work in restaurants, so its come up before. Worst was when I was 16, working for a pizza joint. I was at the nearest intersection (a major corner, right up the street from my High School) holding a sign advertising our special, when a car waved me over. Normally, people ask where we are ( kinda out of the way) so I didn't think anything of it. Nope. She asked me " How much for the pepperoni?" Thinking she meant the sign, I looked down and then back up, but she threw me a wink and said " No, for YOUR pepperoni! " Thankfully, the light turned green and she drove off. Worst part was her two elementary school age daughters in the back seat were listening and trying to stop her...	I used to work in an office with all women, and many times they'd carry on conversations about hot dudes, sex, and bodily functions that I've seen women complain about from men. They'd also flirt with me, hug me, rub my head, and even sit on my lap even though they knew I had a girlfriend who was not okay with that.
Men of askmen, what are your cooking skills like?	I do 90% of the cooking. I went from trying to make stuff taste as good as possible (i.e. really unhealthy shit) to finally figuring out how to make healthy food. I have a few mind-blowing dishes that I keep in my pocket for special occasions, but usually it's just chicken, fish, or salads. Favorite thing (and surprisingly easy): osso buco. Pro-Tip: If you're not using sea salt in your salads, take a good hard look at your life and ask where it all went wrong	My wife has done most of the cooking the last few years, since she's been a student and SAHM, but now that she's working again, it'll likely end up about even. We're both pretty good cooks, but I think I'm generally better at seasoning and cooking meats, whereas she's got a good eye for combining flavors into a larger dish and making it all come together. Between the two of us, I think we're pretty damn good. Not sure my kids would agree, but kids don't know shit.
What are some ways you can be intimate with your partner without resorting to sex?	the word resorting troubles me... as if sex is a chore or not enjoyable. Although sex is not the be all and end all it shouldnt be thought of as 'oh god sex again'	When we’re laying on the couch or bed, he likes to rest his head on my chest and I’ll run my fingers through his hair.
Fellow single men, what’s a dating dealbreaker that significantly reduces the dating pool for you?	No kids and not fat. Child free because I want to share that moment together. Fat is disgusting and a sign that they're a generally bad person. Of course those are dating standards. Fucking standards are wide open.	Someone who can talk to me and be super into what they're talking about. Vague I know But so many times you date a girl and ask her what her hobbies are or what she does in her spare time and the answer is always "just chill out" or "eat". So like when you're on your own you just sort of sit in your apartment doing nothing? Feels like they're just piggy backing off my interests and not bringing anything of their own to the relationship
Do you behave less friendly to men after having experiences of them taking it as a sign of interest?	No. I'm friendly and nice and like being that way. I don't approach people but with classmates, acquaintances, friends of friends, delivery people, strangers that are being nice, etc. I act friendly and nice (especially as I'm overcoming my social anxiety). Unless 100% of the men I encountered took it as a sign of interest, I wouldn't change my ways. It's who I am.	100% yes. I'm a pretty bubbly person, but smiling, eye contact, friendliness, and compliments have all been interpreted as a sign of interest. I'm still a friendly person, but I've learned to be more aloof and standoffish out of necessity. I think I might have resting nice face.
Men who are in great shape and good health in their forties and beyond, how did you do it and how are you managing it?	I'm killing it at 48. I have been partying my whole life. Look great, feel great, never get sick or injured. Been with many women. It's a genetic lottery. I'm lucky. Live at the beach and have fun. Vanity helps. But I'm not wasting my life in a gym. I've got fun to do.	My dad did it as a coping mechanism during my parents' divorce. Probably not the "healthiest" way to get healthy, but definitely one of the healthier obsessions to throw yourself into. He was pretty fit in his 20s and into his 30s, so I think he really latched onto to doing all the stuff he hadn't been able to do in 20 or so years.
What do your female friends offer that your male friends typically don't?	Hopefully a relationship at some point. EDIT: heading off the downvotes. I haven't really gained anything from female acquaintances that I didn't already have from male associates. This is the one thing special I could see coming of it.	Advice and insight about other women. My guy friends are great and I treat them like family but relationship advice isn't in their wheelhouse.
How do I, as a big sister, teach my teen brother not to be a douchbag?	Being a douchebag with women works so as long as he isn't abusive, don't worry about it. The drugs are a serious issue though. You may want to seek professional help for that.	Don't date douchebags and let him observe it. Expose him to women that don't give off the "men are disposable" vibe if possible. His breakup anger is something he'll have to deal with on his own unless he explicitly reaches out for some sort of dialogue.
How do pads stop blood leaking via the butt crack when you're lying on your back?	Poor OP probably thought we were going to reveal some super cool woman secret, but instead we're just like, "nope that's actually a big problem."	mine have leaked during sleep due to that. when it's really heavy and i'm scared that I might leak I put a towel down on my bed so I don't accidentally fuck up my sheets.
What are some subtle signs that someone is merely tolerating you?	The corner of their eyes tighten when you talk together. It's very subtle but even with a friendly expression the eyes always tighten if the person doesn't like who they are interacting with.	Doesn't show a whole lot of interest in conversation (not reciprocating in asking questions or continuing the conversation), favors interacting with other people besides you, and doesn't make an effort to see/hangout with you.
How to let a man know you're interested in him romantically/sexually without mentioning appearance?	As a male, and if it were me, laugh at my jokes, casually bump into me, then if I'm interested, when I try to advance into your personal space, let me.	By just plain asking him on a date. As far as appearance, he can see you - nothing you say is going to substantially disguise how you look or change how he feels about it. So just ask him out and let him decide.
What's the worst place or context you've been hit on?	I always get hit on by the 12 year olds riding their bikes on my street. I'm very popular with young black boys, I think it's adorable and shows good confidence. They're always so polite too.	I was a waitress. Guy came in with two little boys. Proceeded to hit on me throughout the entire time he was there and then was like "you don't happen to have daddy issues by any chance?" The next week he came back with his wife...
Who elses loves Winter?	blech, I hate the cold. I hate having to wear 17 layers of constricting clothes and be barely able to move and waddle around like a penguin. Also, it rains in the winter where I live and I HATE the rain. I have a raincoat, but what do I do about my pants and my shoes? Umbrellas can only do so much. Yeah, no. Nothing good about winter.	Me!! I detest summer. Summer to me means mosquitoes, bug bites, severe sunburn, heatstroke and extra bad BO on public transport. Winter to me means rainy days, storms, cuddling under blankets with the SO for movies and reading a book in front on the fire place. I love snow, but it doesn't snow anywhere near me which sucks! Edit: I also love going to the beach in winter. It's so peaceful.
My wife doesn't understand why men constantly grab their junk. Let's hear some reasons to make her understand?	We do? Well, I don't. None of my friends do. In fact, I don't know a single guy nor have I ever known one to constantly grab their junk.	Tell her that we get “boob sweat” under our balls and we need to move things a bit to air them out.
Currently having a full breakdown in an airport. What are your worst travel stories?	When I was 14 I went to Houston for a volleyball tournament. Our coach dropped us off at the wrong terminal 1.5 hours before our flight. So there were just 12 - 14 year old girls trying to figure out where to go in a huge airport by ourselves and hour before our flight. We made it but it was really close and it was awful.	I got stuck on a mountain in Iceland in a rental car. We had to call emergency rescue. It took them three hours to find us in brutal cold (reindeer were roaming past us for part of the time). Then another hour to get the car out of the snow it was stuck in. Then we had to follow them back to town (40km) and stay there for the night.
Men who had their first romantic/sexual experience in your mid-20s or later, what is your story?	I was 24 and got my first real kiss and lost my virginity with my first girlfriend on our second date. We were so sunburnt after the whole day at a country music festival but I didn't feel a thing until after. I came so hard when she was going down on me that I actually hit myself in the face and chest. I clumsily ate her out until I rallied though, I am a gentleman after all.	I played video games all day in high school and college. I never put myself out there and became a fat slob. I ended up leaning on friends and roommates to be socially active, but I actually tried to meet new people and make any new friends. Eventually I got sick of being who I was and I started putting effort into myself. I graduated college, got a respectable job, and lost a ton of weight. I finally started putting myself out there. I started online dating, met a cute girl, and we hit it off. The rest was history.
Those that have had someone attempt to murder them - how did you get over it and what else happened as a result?	The day he attacked me he swore if I ever survived he would track me down and kill me. And if he couldn't find me- he would find my family. Gun shamers need to do some research- or perhaps need to be better educated on them. Anyone without a gun is an automatic victim of circumstance. I'll always have a choice to fight- now my chances of winning are much higher.	I had a guy stab me because I turned him down at a party. I am not sure if his intent was to actually kill me or if he was just attacking me for funsies without purpose. I still hate guys approaching me cold. I doubt I will ever get over it. What else happened? I had to go stay in the hospital and get my first GYN appt because I had a stomach wound which was possible to have affected my reproductive stuffs. Also, I was 14 when this happened.
How are you doing? Anything you need to get off your chest? Any exciting plans for this weekend?	Today was awful Tweaked my back at the gym Car tire had irreparable leak so had to buy four tires(thank god I have good credit, but also burnt through half my savings I have been working hard to build back up after a bad financial year) New swimsuit came in and is like five pounds away from fitting me so normally not an issue but just icing on the worm cake... Then I was playing minecraft to unwind and relax and I play on an online server and someone had claimed a section where I was building somehow so now I have to wait for a server admin to fix the issue.... Anyways at work now so hopefully my bad luck is over and work goes well!	Saturday is my birthday and I'm feeling kinda bummed this year... so with gas prices low and weather being mild this weekend I'm taking a road trip to see my sister.
What is something you often hear men say they want in a woman, but you think they wouldn't like if they actually got it?	As a man, I can you tell you one thing is big boobs.... If you see enough big boobs you KNOW its hard to find a skinny girl with big boobs and big boobs that do not sag. Getting older I am sure this only is less a possibility....	I'm an extremely plain, conservative dresser, and my husband always thought it would be super fun if I wore sexy clothes to go out with him. I wore a moderately low-cut dress once. He noticed that a ton of people were looking at my boobs. He enjoyed this much less than he thought he would. Sexy clothes have not been brought up since.
My boyfriend says I don't understand the subtle aggression between men when they don't know one another but are in conflict/competition for something. Is there a whole other meta game that I'm unaware of governing how men react with one another?	I don't know how old you guys are, but to me he sounds like a teenager trying to look tough. Sure, anyone can escalate to violence when necessary, but not for something as trivial as a shoulder bump in the street.	Is nobody going to mention the fact that they casually bumped into each other and then the girl immediately started talking about how they were out celebrating her new job having a few drinks? Honestly this stranger doesn't really give a shit about that.
Too many relationship posts on the front page. What's your favorite sandwich?	***The Ghetto Sandwich*** Is pretty simple. You're gonna take a polish sausage and slice it lengthwise. Almost in half but not fully. Throw it into a pan and cook it on both sides. Then smother that sunamuhbitch in onions, cheese, mustard, mayonnaise and ketchup in between slices of white bread. I'm also really partial to olives and tomato in a roll. Sometimes with roast beef or another deli meat.	I've got 2. Sandwich the first. Ciabatta bread. Lightly toasted. Thinly sliced red onion. Blue cheese dressing. Baby spinach. Medium rare strip steak sliced and salted. Sliced avocado. Dash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. And then the other half of the bread. Sandwich the second. Turkish bread, lightly toasted. Garlic dressing. Rib eye steak. Red onion relish (red onions, garlic, balsamic, tomatoes, sugar). Salad. Swiss cheese. Other half of bread.
How is it to have a foreskin?	Myself im not circumcised but I always keep the fore skin pulled back cause having it cover the tip just looks weird to me. Never got used to that look	When you take a shower you can store water in it, it's a useless fact but I just wanted you to know it's possible
When was the last time somebody told you they were proud of you?	Saying you're proud of someone is pretty patronizing. I mean, it's okay coming from a parent. But if my boss or a friend said they were proud of me I'd flinch ask who the eff they thought they were to say something like that.	My wife does so regularly. She actually has a little song she sings, which her mother sang/sings to her. *I'm proud of you,* *I'm proud of you,* *I'm ve-ry, ve-ry proud of you!* *I'm proud of you,* *So proud of you,* *And I hope you're proud of you too.* It, and she, are adorable. That being said, and recognizing that is silly and childish, I do thoroughly enjoy it when she sings the I'm proud of you song.
Have you ever burnt out on online dating? What was that like?	It will only work if: - You're "Tall" (6'-6'4) - You're good looking (at least a 7 on the 10 rating scale) - Older then 23 if you're doing the sites, apps don't matter as much - Good position in life (correlates with age) have own place, good car, wealthy enough, have a career. A woman told me most men she met off there were still in Min Wage jobs and she didn't want to date these people due to that.	People say rejection is better than not trying, but I've found rejection to be way worse. I'm apparently not attractive enough for online dating.
What misconceptions about male sexuality would you want to clear up for a young teenage boy?	Sex and gender are linked. Stay off Tumblr; no one there has any grasp of basic human biology, medical fact, and common sense. One cannot change sex or into anything else simply by 'thinking' really hard. Anything outside the norm is abnormal. No it doesn't mean you'll be hunted down for 'rehabilitation'. If you're a boy who likes boys, fine. If you're a girl who likes girls fine. If you like both, there's problem. You cannot give your 'feeling's to two people in the same amount. You will find preference of one over the other. As scary as it may sound, your family is your best support. Friends could be a close second, but opening up to them over your family is hurtful.	Your friends are, with 99% certainty, **not** having as much sex as they say they are. The median lifetime number of partners is 6ish. A few get a lot more, most do not. Just chill out and don't worry about notches on your bedpost.
What deal breaker(s) did you discover AFTER moving in with your SO?	I think I'd rather just live alone and pee in the sink than live with someone at this point. And play video games ALL day. Can't wait for sex robots.	With my ex from college, I realized that I would pretty much have to do all the cooking and cleaning constantly because he could never be bothered with it. Moaning and tantrums happened when I asked him to do something. And he wondered why I became cranky all the time.
How to make her think it’s not my first kiss?	No tongue at first, slowly and soflty open and close your lips onto hers... Mirror what she's doing, also they like it when you kinda grope their arse a bit if you've been kissing for more than 5-10 seconds	If it makes you feel better, I was my boyfriend's first kiss when he was 23 and I couldn't tell.
Men of Reddit who felt overly attached to one person from your past, how did your current SO make you forget about it?	You’re supposed to have worked through those attachment issues before getting into a relationship. This is like asking how to safely take your clothes off while you’re taking a bath. Do it before you get in the bath, genius.	On one hand you shouldn't be dependent upon another person to make you forget about a different person. On the other hand, things from our teens can hold onto us pretty strongly. They are our formative years and when our brains make a lot of connections and pathways, and that's why the music we listen to in our teens generally holds a special place in our hearts our entire lives. For instance, I'm 37 and still love Limp Bizkit.
Does it feel significantly different (better, more intense) when you finally get to fuck a woman you really love?	Meh, love isn't hot. Love leads to marriage and there's nothing less sexy than marriage. Write your men as insatiable narcissits who see a woman denying them as a lethal threat to their ego. Make them power-hungry sociopaths who can't fathom hearing "no". That will makes those juices and thus, bucks, flowing. Just ask the Shades of Grey lady.	The emotional connection makes it orders of magnitude better. It becomes less of a pure physical act (which has its place - sometimes just pure animalistic lust is just what I want) and more of a spiritual one if we are both just focused on each other.
Seriously, how do you change the type of people you attract?	You said nothing about yourself which is what's needed to change the type of ppl you attract. You say ppl are intimate at the start of a relationship and then they stop feeling the need for intimacy. Do you get more attached and emotionally invested the longer the relationship? If you answered yes that's the problem	Change your social circles. You may be dating the same type of girls because it's the ones you are running into a lot.
Well... What DO you do when the guy slaps your girlfriends ass in the club?	I have to fight him and potentially get my ass kicked. At the end of the day if she doesn't feel safe with you, she's going to leave you or cheat on you. How are you going to look her in the face knowing that you let someone sexually assault her? Even if you ran, you'll probably still feel like a punk later on. That's a lose-lose.	Happened to me when I was about 20 or 21. Guy just rests his hand on my chicks ass. I took his hand off and held his hand while looking at him and smiling. He got out of there really quickly.
What behaviour or tropes do you often see woman characters doing in TV and movies, that you rarely ever see in person?	Women being able to sprint or hike through some kind of wilderness in heels. Specifically Jurassic world with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. So completely unrealistic. First of all, her heels would have gotten stuck every step in the mud and grass. Second, yes I have once or twice sprinted in heels to make a train or something, but for the whole movie for her to be running everywhere in them? She would have taken them off 30 seconds into the jungle.	* Getting ready for a date/whatever in a huge video/phone call chat situation (usually more teen/younger movies but still). Usually I’ll just send the group text like “do I look hot?” and that’s about it * Leaving work in the middle of the workday to go get lunch and like go shopping??? * 20 year olds working a 6 figure salary as an assistant at a Publisher * the 30 year old that truly believes their life is over because they haven’t found The One yet * edit: Gone into labor? Immediately full-fledged screaming pain, splashing broken water at their feet, everyone Freaking Out
How would you react if someone told you they had a crush on you back in high school?	One woman from school tried that. A group of friends from my HS got together and then some I hadn't seen since then. After she said that, I asked "Why didn't you say anything?" DEER IN HEADLIGHTS. Probably pissed her off but she isn't that good looking and she smokes. The other woman was pretty; she is of Native American descent and has strong, high cheekbones. Met up with some of those same friends on a cabin trip. Had sex with her in a hot tub; not as amazing as people make it out to be. Hooked up and spent time together after that weekend but it didn't work out. Awesome body, good sex and all but she never told me that she did back then.	This happened to me at my 10 year reunion. A girl I went out with a couple times told me how she was surprised I asked her out at all when so many girls were after me. I had no clue what she was talking about, but she listed off 8 or 9 names of girls that she knew has crushes on me at that time. I was popular enough, but I just figured it was because I played sports and tried to be friendly. Turns out that a lot of the drama girls liked me (she was in all the plays/musicals in school) and they gave her shit because they were jealous of her. I didn't believe her at first. I wasn't much of a catch back then, so I don't know what they saw in me.
What do you consider romantic that others might find offensive or creepy?	My boyfriend is very fond of the slap to the face as a sign of affection. I am super into it. My husband really enjoys being called "onii-chan" which means big brother. Better if I say it in a cute little kid voice. Actually I think like a good 75% of my romantic and sexual relationships with those two would make vanilla folks really uncomfortable. Huh, I am honestly not sure which part of this caused the downvotes. But I cant say Im shocked.	I feel like I kind of have a D/s thing going on with my husband even though we never explicitly discussed doing it. I'm usually a very headstrong leader type so it is kind of a nice change of pace. Since I don't currently own money, I ask him if I can buy things sometimes (usually frivilous things, I don't ask with important stuff) and for some reason get a lot of contentment out of this dynamic and being given permission. It almost feels like a father-daughter dynamic and I bet a lot of people find that creepy. I also like it when he randomly comes up and starts grabbing my butt or boobs or something. From what I understand a lot of people find that offputting.
Do you think society has taken political correctness to an extreme? Are people way too easily offended these days?	Yeah but I think ultimately it's a good thing and changes things for the better. I know people get annoyed by feminists, gay rights, race stuff, SJWs, whiners, complainers, PC people, etc. But the world (maybe just the US?) has gotten so much more progressive in the last decade. I feel like even the most adamant of "activist" haters at least stop and think a bit more when it comes to those issues. Hell, even my father, the most religious, racist, sexist, homophobic person I know has kind of laid off a bit on those issues.	People opposing "political correctness" is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's just "waaah, I can't make racist jokes anymore". But, OTOH, I think some parts of society have become really, really intellectually cowardly. Ideas are starting to rise and fall based not on whether they are true, or even whether they hurt someone, but based on whether they vaguely suggest something is bad.
My male friends who were sexually/romantically frustrated in their 20s are now getting serious ass in their 30s. Why is this?	Girls value guys by money success and status and guys value girls by attractiveness. This is why guys in their thirties pursue girls in their early twenties and vice versa. (Disclaimer: in my experience).	They must have all read about that one weird trick from the buzzfeed article. on a serious note though, young and old men are valued differently. Young men are supposed to be cool mysterious and older men are supposed to be stable and caring. Your friends were ~~never the latter and always the former~~never the former and always the latter so eventually the expectations of their age matched their nature.
Have you ever asked a friend to set you up before? How did it go?	Never did that. Mostly because I'm awkward as fuck around people I've never met before, so just having a first date is bad enough. But also because my friendships are very one-sided. I care more about them than they care about me. I'm sure if I asked them to do that, they'd be all for it, and completely forget about it within a few days.	Yes. It did not go well. She arrived late, happened to run into a guy from her college at the restaurant we were at and then decided to leave me alone at the table to go chat him up for a bit. He was trying to have his own date at the time and was actually annoyed by her presence. I guess that she *might've* had a crush on him in the past, but his companion at the time wasn't pleased about it either. I, being alone at my table, had a nice meal (like fuck am I going to pass up a chicken biryani), paid for what I ordered and left. She didn't even notice. My friend, having found out what happened was quite mortified and hasn't (thankfully) tried to set me up since.
What is the one trait you do NOT like in a man?	If he spend more time grooming then me. I want a man who showers and has good hygiene, but girlish manicured hands, designer clothes, and hair that requires products are a turn off for me.	The kind of insecurity that leads a man to continually assert his masculinity. It's very tiring and frustrating to be around.
What do you regret not doing in your youth?	I'm only 23 and just graduated from college but I was never good enough for women, I was only good enough to be their back up, get lead on, and used for attention. Some guys here regret the chances they didn't take, but still got and get chances. I was never really given a chance, I was the guy on the side while other guys were the ones getting chances with them and having the experiences I wanted with those girls.I can never go back and be good enough and I don't think I will ever move on from that, I don't think any woman will really live up to what I wanted either now.	Being myself. I was always trying to be someone else so I could have friends or have a girlfriend. Now that I am 40 I am who I want to be
Women who have climbed your way up the corporate ladder, what are things you wish you knew looking back on your journey?	Girl I’m an manager at Taco Bell, lemme tell you. It wadnt eassy. I had to suck up to my manager to get him to let me to become too part of the team. Very happy Now. Good results	I used to feel guilty asking for more money - even though I was a kick ass worker. I wish I had snapped out of that earlier.
What is something about your period that isn't as common as you thought?	Attempting suicide shortly before every period is not a common occurrence. It's also not common for your period to just disappear for months at a time	I thought bleeding through a super tampon in less than two hours for two days of my period was normal was normal. I also thought that having period cramps so bad that I would be curled up and crying in the fetal position was normal. Turns out it’s not.
What's the most memorable time a guy didn't catch that you were flirting with him?	Once I never made eye contact or talked to this guy I obsessed about. I can't believe he had no idea!	The other day I came home from work really horny and told my fiance to take his pants off. He was like "Why?"
How do you plan to raise your daughter(s) in regards to sex?	I think I will likely raise either gender child with the same guidelines for sex. Basically it will center on the importance of respecting your body and how the purpose of sex is to bond yourself to the person you've chosen to marry.	I would raise her to *hopefully* understand both the pros and cons of sex. Teenage boys can be jerks and if she is anything like me, she will fall for them and trust them when they say they love her, just so they can get her into bed. Thankfully I have only slept with 2 people. One guy after high school graduation who I had dated for almost 6 months. We broke up after because I did not want to be with him forever. The next guy, my husband. I saved myself a lot of heartbreak by not sleeping around. But, in the end, it's her body. And it would be my job to teach her about birth control, STD's, etc so she knows all the "facts".
What are the differences between the men of reddit and the men you encounter in your life?	Derailing of the topic is not permitted. This thread is *not* about specific subs. It is about men on reddit as a whole. Also, this is not the time to yell about \#notallmen. That's also derailing. Just because someone says "menofreddit" does not mean they are talking about *you* specifically^^1. Just that this is a type of person users have dealt with in the past. Don't be vain. ^^1 Unless of course you *fit* said description, in which case take the opportunity to evaluate your life.	Derailing of the topic is not permitted.

Gentlemen. Your 15yr old daughter comes to you and says, "I want to get dates and have a boyfriend. How do I get boys to like me"? What do you tell her?	I'll be honest with her, all she has to do is look good and the boys will come to her.	I have a 14 year old that turns 15 in roughly a month. We've had this conversation, and I tell her that she is not to "get boys to like her", she is to be herself, which she does. The boys will either like her or not. I tell her not to change who she is for anyone, she's smart, funny, beautiful, strong, athletic (she's on the volleyball team and plays travel volleyball as well). If she changes and puts on a "show" for a boy, then he's not interested in who she REALLY is, and that person, the girl she REALLY is has value, is an important person, and not someone that has to change to please anyone. That's what I tell her. :-)
Divorced men who initiated the divorce: what could have saved it?	texting another woman while you still live in the same house & haven't even started the divorce? i would be LIVID. you wait & see how long she lasts when he has to move away in 6 months. but my honest opinion is that it sounds like you can be pretty rough on him, so he is getting the affection he needs elsewhere.	> I don't take criticism from him well I've been close to pulling the trigger a couple times because of this but she's working on it. I cannot feel safe in a relationship with a woman who reacts poorly to me telling her she's hurting me.
To counter our brother sub's post: What is the most psycho thing a guy has ever done to you?	As a guy I can only apologise for the amount of abuse and upset other males have caused you. I'm horrified by some of the things that have been said and I hope everyone else is too.	Made me stand naked on a table in front of his friends while he pointed out every physical flaw and threatened to shave my head if I didn't stop crying. Punched me in the stomach as hard as he could at random times when we were kissing or having sex. Threw my cel phone into traffic so I couldn't call the police after he tried to strangle me outside a nightclub. While I was running to a gas station for help he chased after me screaming that he'd beat me home and kill my dog. It was only after he threatened my dog that I got strong enough to leave him. Ah, l'amour.
What is the worst pain you've ever experienced?	The hangover afer NYE 2014, or the last time I drank. You may scoff at me for comparing a hangover to your kidney stone or open fracture, but 99% of you world be dead if you did what I did on NYE 2014.	A kidney stone, I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning in a cold sweat feeling like my guts were exploding and I couldn't tell which end it was going to come out of. I spent the next several hours alternating between sitting on the toilet and laying beside it on the cool bathroom floor, most of time with tears streaming down my face.
What are the best and worst comments you received after losing significant weight?	I don't really remember any good comments, but someone said "you don't look any different" after I dropped 20lbs in a week and a half, but i guess that's not really significant weight loss.	Fry: Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin. Dr. Zoidberg: [calling to Edna] You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
Women who were, or whose parents forced you to be, part of the purity movement, how has it affected you today?	Wasn't part of any "purity movement" or anything but definitely raised with a sexual morality of self-respect and an emphasis on commitment. My sexual relationships have been meaningful and long lasting. I have never had any STDs or abortions unlike some friends of mine. I have friends who's parents really didn't care what they did and some of them have had over 30 sex partners, abortions, contracted herpes and been pumped and dumped which made them feel like shit. All in all I think I've had a much better outcome than they have.	I was pushed into it by both my (public) school and my church, but my parents weren't 100% committed to it and didn't push it. They weren't even aware of what the school was doing. I basically paid lip service to the trend as needed to avoid being singled out, ostracized, or bullied, but never bought it, thanks in large part to having internet access during my teen years.
What are you tired of hearing about, as a woman, about women?	As a woman and about women and from women. I'm sick of getting flack for not jumping on the feminist and BLM train. Just because I am black and a women doesn't mean I have to be part of these movements. Hell, I was even blocked by some sjw because I see those groups tip toeing on the line of being a hate group and he couldn't deal with it.	I generally don't have anything to add to these, but a coworker said a few months ago that this girl who severely sexually harassed by a guy should get over it and I should think about how embarrassing it must be for the guy to have to tell people what he did (he was arrested for exposing himself multiple times). He's a fucking grown man, he knew what he was doing.
What's one aspect of dating men and women, respectively, fail to understand or come to terms with?	It's tough both ways. Men have to deal with the problems that come from approaching and projecting an attractive, confident personality and dealing with inevitable rejection. Women have the problem of trying to filter the men who *do* approach them for one who can handle her particular brand of crazy and/or bullshit. As much as it sucks sometimes to be the one who has to put his ego on the line, I'd hate it even *more* if the only way I had to filter was to choose from the ones who approached me.	sometimes things just don't click. you're not a bad person, they're not a bad person. it just didn't work and that's ok.
What’s something you’ve learnt about yourself only from being in a relationship?	That I have some hugely codependent tendencies fostered by mirroring the relationships my parents and sister have. Also, that I blossom and function better when I'm in a polyamorous relationship than a monogamous one because it helps prevent those codependent tendencies.	I’m clingy and I care too much. not in an overbearing way (at least I don’t think so/have never been told) but I want to hear from or see my person often and feel more easily disconnected when I don’t.
Girls pretending to be interested in me for fun - how to prevent being a target?	It was not about you. It only became about you when you made it about you. When girls are in a group it is about the social hierarchy in the group. The girl brought you over to prove here value and dominance over the group. That was your function, to look and act like a prize. Be social, be gentlemanly, be flirtatious but polite. 'Not now, maybe later' would have been a good line for you. You be the one to make them wait and guess. You ruined your chances with all the women there. It's not about you. Quit assuming it is.	I have questions: where do they take you when they say come with us? What happens when you’re there? I just want to make sure that it *is* some weird game that you described and you’re not misinterpreting the situation and they’re actually in to you. If you’re correct and they are just fucking with you, if you’re in a scenario where something like this could take place, indifference is your best friend. Say something like “oh that’s flattering but I’m talking with X here, tell her to come join us” and stay put. If their “friend” really is interested, they’ll come up to you and that’s when you can make your move. I’m not saying don’t ever make yourself vulnerable but in social situations where humiliating you is possibly the goal, don’t play their game.

What are the habits you adopted that made you a healthier person?	I'm really surprised at the amount of people here who count calories... Not all calories are the same. Edit: I realize the helpful impact of just looking at and critically evaluating what we eat! But calories specifically seems a bit much.	Writing an affirmations on my mirror every day to remind myself of my strength, my worth isn't based on what others think, and I am not the sum of my mistakes. While you may not have been asking about mental health, it is just as important as physical health. When I show myself compassion, I make much healthier choices all around.
What stereotype about women has the most negative effect on men?	That women consider confidence to be at least as important as appearance. Truth is, confidence and personality mean nothing if you aren't attractive. The idea that women appreciate confidence motivates some men to try to improve themselves for a phantom cause. Once they're continuously rejected after self-improvement, they can feel hopeless and nihilistic. Unattractive men should not be given false hope.	That they're harmless delicate flowers that can't hurt a soul. I've seen many a guy get cheated on or manipulated and refusing to believe that his girlfriend/wife did it intentionally because of how he was raised. Hell it even screws around guys not in relationships who can't see the girl is just using them and has no interest in them. I plan to raise my son that girls can be just as bad as guys, not worse mind you but simply on par. Edit: Y'all are really getting caught up on my wording towards the end. The not worse part was simply to state I don't plan to raise him to think women are inherently worse then men and both can be equally as cruel.
I keep seeing guys ask what they should have to impress girls they bring over, so I'm curious, what would you like to see at a girl's place?	1. Collection of the heads of her slain enemies. Failing that, at least their ears (I understand apartments are getting smaller nowadays) 2. Birth control bottle prominently placed on the bathroom vanity would be a nice touch too. 3. Decent six pack of craft beer or bottle of whiskey 4. Preferably 0 cats, but certainly not more than 1 cat 5. A friendly dog 6. Vidya console 7. Bookshelf filled with actual literature instead of old textbooks or unopened art and philosophy texts	A clean place. I work hard to keep mine clean. If I were dating, it would be among the top things I'd be noticing about a date's place.
Do funny women finish last?	Because a lot of women are too serious and can't take a joke. We want women who will laugh instead of calling us names	You know, I've read about all these traits women have that turn men off: men don't like smart women, men don't like powerful women, men don't like successful women, and now men don't like funny women. I've read about them all here on the internet. However, I've never met ANYONE like that in real life. Seriously. No one has ever thought, "Oh man, this girl is hot. I want to bang the.... wait, is she making a joke? And it's a good one? FUCK THIS!"

What was your worst date ever and why?	I dated a guy for almost a year once where it was VERY rare for him to take me out on the date, he also would never pay for my half. We'd split the bills every time. I guess its not too horrible...but hey	A guy that I saw regularly on campus kept asking me out every time I saw him, until I finally agreed to go out. I don't know what he had in mind, but I assumed that since he made such a big deal about asking me out, that he would be paying for the date. We went to a fast food restaurant, which was fine, but then he didn't have any money on him. At all. Luckily my mama taught me to be prepared, but I only had $10 on me, so we shared a bowl of chili and had some ice water. Then he wanted me to go to his apartment with him. NOPE. I took the bus home.
Have you ever met a man that blew your mind away? What was he like?	Saw a guy for a while. He was tall, athletic (rugby), British (the accent was sexy), confident, and most importantly of all, goddam brilliant. Got his doctorate in math (topology) and even though I know nothing about it I loved to listen to him explain new concepts. And he fucked me like a goddam champ. Lots of dirty talk and hit all the right spots, ya know? But even though he blew my mind, he was also an asshole as he was cheating on someone else to see me. Making me the other woman, though I didn't know it at the time. Fucker (in more ways than one).	Genuinely gentle. Everything he says is matter-of-fact, even the emotional things, because there's no shame in feeling a certain way. He reads. He writes. He's creative and unafraid. Easy to talk to. He won't sugarcoat anything he has to say. He doesn't lose his temper easily. Quietly passionate. Dark eyes, intense and honest and smoldering and unafraid. That ~~boy's~~ man's smile is the thing every girl wants directed at them at least once. And when it happens, it always, *always* hits his eyes first. And I don't think he knows when it's happening, which makes it even better. When he looks at me and I see that little smile twitch in the corner of his eye, I melt. He's playful and protective and kind and one of the most goddamn amazing people I've ever met.
How did you change for better or worse when you got an SO?	Jesus. Before we were dating I was an unemployed alcoholic smoker. Now I'm employed, quit drinking two years ago, and quit vaping a few months ago.	More anxiety, depression, self consciousness, insecurity, less confident. Never thought I’d feel like this, ever. I used to be that confident charismatic go getter. I’m beaten down and need to get out. Edit: everyone you are too kind. Thank you for the support, it gives me hope. :)
Have you ever been told that a romantic partner of yours harassed or abused other women while you were together? How did you find out, and how did you react?	Flip side of this: My husband's ex-wife is completely unstable. I think we were married already when she started another screaming match at a kids baseball game yelling about how terrible he is and he abuses animals and feels sorry for me. This is the kind of guy that other women are jealous of me about 😂. We've been married for three years and I've yet to see any "abuse". He's incredibly supportive. We have a farm and he takes such good care of everyone. When we had to put his horse down a week ago he cried all the way home. What a monster. Moral of the story: Don't believe everything you hear. Some women are just jealous pschos.	Kind of the reverse. The guy I dated basically emotionally abused me and would constantly put me down. He was never there for me emotionally and one time made fun of me so much over a video game that I started crying, then continued to make fun of me until he decided to just flat out ignore me for hours after I finally snapped on him. I talked to his ex before me and she had a completely different story. They dated for longer and she said that he had always treated her right consistently. He could be a little mean, she said, but was also very nice most of the time and would be there emotionally for her. I don't know why, but hearing that made me feel so much worse... Like I wasn't worthy of his love, but for some reason she was.
Women with the arm implant birth control, did you put on weight and if so how much?	My daughter had it and put on a lot of weight quickly. She gained 15 lbs maybe? In 6 months. They took it back out but she hasn’t lost the weight yet. All of her friends gained weight too.	I love mine, I’ve had two now, and I’ll get another in December when this one expires. Didn’t gain any weight or have any negative side effects.
What the weirdest, shallowest, or smallest reason you have ever stopped dating someone?	He said "when i meet your mom..." Huge deal breaker to think he would ever meet my standards for him to meet my mom. Dated for over 2 months before he fucked it up.	He had to get naked to do anything in the bathroom. Using the toilet, brushing his teeth, fixing his hair...
Are there differences in the level of harassment between countries (specifically European vs. the U.S.)?	I'm Australian and have travelled extensively. I find that European men are more likely to approach you and ask you out for coffee/drinks but they are much less likely to harass you if you say no. Edit: it's been pointed out to me that I shouldn't generalise like that which is correct. My apologies. I did explain that I meant the Italian, French, Spanish men that I had come across. But even within those countries I am sure there are vast differences. This is purely my experience.	I'm Australian and have travelled extensively.

Today, I peed myself in the car while stuck in traffic. When was the last time you guys peed on yourself?	Why the fuck wouldn't you, I dunno, get out and pee over the highway railing or something? If the traffic's that bad, leaving your car stopped for 30 seconds can't be that big of a deal. I don't think I've ever peed myself, except for wetting the bed like once when I was... 5? 6? Or does peeing on your own feet while you're in the shower count? If so, probably last week.	I can hold my pee like there's no tomorrow. Maybe its a combination of stage fright and laziness, but I can go like 10 or 12 hours at a time without peeing. It starts to hurt though, so I'm not sure why I do it.
Has your SO ever started to become unattractive to you (weight gain)? How did you handle it?	lol bunch of feminists in this thread downvoting legitimate comments. If a girl is 5'2" 120 and goes up to 130, any sane man would have a talk with her or just dump her ass. 10 lbs is very noticeable on a girl that size and nobody's happy about FUPA	I got a little heavier in my last relationship. I gained 12lbs which isn't a big deal since I am 5'9" but it was noticeable. He came out and said "Hey I want to join the gym to get back in shape, let's go together. It'll motivate me more if I have you there cheering me on." I knew why he was bringing it up but I felt that was a very tactful and kind way of getting to the same point- that he was starting to find me unattractive physically and wanted me to care about my physical appearance again.
What is a time you were unambiguously right but everyone else was against you?	In high school the English teacher asked students to raise their hands if they were pro choice. I was the only person out of maybe 15 people. 🤘 That ended up sparking a huge debate.	I was captain of the dance team and we were marching in a parade. 3 other captains are marching alongside me at the front of the group. The band plays a marching song and I was clapping on 2 and 4 like you're supposed to, and the other 3 captains were clapping on 1 and 3. Naturally, the group followed the 3 captains clapping like Nicole Kidman at the Grammys until our coach ran up and corrected everybody. They were all looking at me like I was crazy and I was right, I was so smug for the rest of that march.
Ladies, amount of sex you want vs. amount of sex you actually have?	Women want sex all the time apparently. But shun anyone in this sub who mentions random approaches or a slight hint of a prospective suitor taking chances to meet new people. Aka: fuck off, but I really do want sex ....here come the downvotes, possible deletion.	I want it once every few days. I end up having it almost every day. My husband is very persuasive.
What are some common "millennial problems" that you can't understand or relate to?	I'm a millennial myself and i just don't get the whole "you can't _____ if you aren't _____" trend. Like yeah let's respect culture, but to me that's just creating segregation, and discouraging us from sharing and knowing each other and appreciating the good things we've all made. I mean i do want people to feel like they are respected, but i don't know where to draw the line sometimes.	I don't relate to the texting pressure in the dating world for today's young people. I've never had issues with conversations via text being difficult, issues with double texting and appearing needy, dropped conversations or misconstrued emoticons. I've never sent nudes or felt like I needed to in order to keep a relationship. When I want to say something, I text. When I don't, I don't.
Why are so many questions directed to women here about relationships or partners?	Because they didn’t know /r/relationshipadvice existed and they have nothing else they can think of to talk to a woman about.	Because that's one of the few things that both men and women are involved in, in which a woman's unique perspective is unattainable to a man through experience.
Your best friend agrees to let you choose them a tattoo, no questions asked. What do you pick?	I'd choose to not get him tattooed. Neither one of us likes tattoos. If it was a temporary thing though, I'd pick a really enthusiastic cartoon unicorn.	A small, gold lantern. Because she's the light in my life and probably is one of the factors keeping me here.
When it comes to finding an SO… what does "chemistry" feel like to you?	It feels like even though there is only one piece of the best cake left, you'd be just as happy to watch your SO enjoy it. It's being able to have fun no matter where you are/what you are doing. When we first started dating, we met up at Target to pick some things up and then we were going to hangout elsewhere. Instead, we ended up walking around the whole store, playing in the children's toys, and then finding ourselves sitting in kiddie chairs. We were in there for 2, maybe 3, hours talking and laughing. When we left, we held hands walking to our cars and he picked me up and kissed me in the parking lot for a few minutes. It's one of my best memories from when we first got together. :)	It's the kind of connection that makes you wonder if kismet is real. Yeah, there are the other parts that come along with having a "crush" or infatuation-being happy when they're around, butterflies, all that. But when you have chemistry, it's like you almost know what they're thinking most of the time. Like you're on the same wavelength. When it's easy, it's easy for both of you. When you're choked up and nervous, you're both choked up and nervous. When something funny happens, you lock eyes and laugh together. It's the kind of connection that doesn't need words to validate its existence. Nobody needs to say it's there because both of you feel it. Other people see it too. And when it's broken, for whatever reason, it hurts like you've lost a piece of yourself.
Men who met their current SO in the "real world" (not school or online): how did you meet them?	School is the real world. Anyway, I met my ex at a club. She was not a random chick though, a friend's girlfriend brought her and introduced us. My previous GF, we were introduced too by a mutual friend, but this was in my late teens and in that friend's house.	I volunteer as a boxing trainer twice a week at a local gym for kids aged 12 to 16, one day a girl turned up to pick up her little brother, we got talking about how well he's doing stuff like that The next week the kid asked me if I would train him one on one on the weekends and I agreed, his sister came to every session and we got talking more and more eventually I asked her if she wanted to get a drink sometime and luckily she said yes That was 5 years ago an we're still going strong
Fit men of Reddit, how have your physical standards / preferences changed since becoming “fit”?	Before lifting I thought Bruce Lee was jacked af god. Now I look at him and think, “wow, he’s actually not even that muscular.”	I've become a lot more critical. A woman who is skinny but without elements of athletic fitness does not intimidate me any more.
Do You Notice That You Code Switch?	It's a typical sign of high empathy. You'll notice people with social issues and autism spectrum will not do this. I grew up in a big, multicultural metropolitan city and I constantly changed my tone, jargon, even accent to a certain degree depending on who I was talking to and who I was with. Some people get freaked out by it or think you're being ingenuous, but it's just a way to identify with people and make yourself part of the group.	Code switching is very common and normal. It's how we adapt to different audiences and speak in a way suited to them so that we identify with one another.
What finally clicked in your mind that changed things for the better?	Financing a car is awesome. I used to only own cars that I paid cash for, and they were all a bit dubious. Now I have a sweet car that's way more than I could buy outright, and the monthly payments are only a small percentage of my income. Plus, free oil changes for life!	"I am working my ass off in a miserable job so my boss can get rich and while I try to provide an unsatisfactory lifestyle to a woman who thinks deserves better".
What do you think about dating someone a lot wealthier than you?	Knowing if I ever had kids with them I wouldn't have to worry about my kid's financial stability would be nice. Don't really care either way. Presents from her would have to be meaningful or made by her I guess.	I've done it. I'm from a VERY poor family. Girl had a multi-million dollar trust fund and was set for life. She had multiple condos in fancy areas of LA. I couldn't hang though. I knew I was pretty much there for the sex. Sample situation: I sent my younger brother a few hundred dollars so he wouldn't go hungry while waiting for his financial aid check. I then listen to her express her appreciation for what her pet psychic told her about her dog for $600. She was also very paranoid. If I didn't text/call her for a little while (few hours) she would frequently ask who I was with and whether or not I was sleeping with them.
How do you guys feel about posting gym progress pics on Facebook?	Yeah it's a douche move. The only time it's acceptable is if it's a before and after picture, and you're alotted one of those. Ever.	I go to the gym for myself and never posted about it. Do you go to better yourself or to get attention, that is the question. So, unless you have some really significant progress, don't post it because it looks so desperate.
Ladies, if your partner could comfortably (and willingly) support the both of you, would you still work?	I would, because the idea of being "kept" makes me feel subhuman, like a pet or a toy or a servant. It makes my skin crawl. I'm pretty damn poor, though, so it's a sensitive subject for me. I'm also a huge hypocrite, because if I won the lottery or somehow ended up in a lucrative career I would be more than happy to support my family and partner, haha. But also, while I wouldn't "work" if I were wealthy, I would still be producing. Writing, gardening, making useful things, making art and theatre--all the hobbies I already do for a little compensation sometimes.	Nope, but I'd be very productive. My entire reason for not wanting to work a conventional job is to have more time to work on things which I consider to be far more meaningful.
What is your biggest, unconventional fear?	The human mind can not comprehend the aspect of “infinity” or “eternal life”. It’s a limitation of mankind. Because everything in the universe that we know of had a beginning and has/will have an end	That I get one of those anaesthetics that make you high for some surgery or whatnot. And my parents and friends sit in my hospital room and laugh at the funny things I say in my delirium and then I say something inexcusable, but everyone thinks that's my real secret opinion, because "drunks and kids tell the truth", and I won't even find out, because obviously nobody wants to talk about it...
What was the best case of karma you've ever witnessed in person?	Ok, so I was kind of a jerk in this story too, that being acknowledged...Many years ago I when I still smoked I was in bumper to bumper traffic and I threw a cigarette butt out my window. The guy in the car next to me rolled down his window and started screaming at me. He was so busy screaming at me that he rear ended the car in front of him. As I passed him I rolled down my window and did [this] (https://youtu.be/rX7wtNOkuHo).	Asshole cut in front of me in the check-in line at the airport claiming that I'd cut in front of him. When I'd been standing there for several minutes. And then while going through security in a hurry he dropped his laptop.
What experience have you had with a health practitioner making an inappropriate comment to you?	Well one of my male doctors would not stop looking at my legs. I was wearing like mid thigh shorts. Another massage therapist at my acupuncturist office asked me like four times to come in for a massage sometime and wouldnt stop ooogling. Ahhhhh	I was having immense stabbing pains in my abdomen. I have an IUD so I was worried it was potentially migrating. I went to the ER because the pain was so bad I couldn't move or walk and was in tears. The doctor (who was not a psychologist or psychiatrist) looked at my chart, noticed I had some psych history, and went on this long rant about how depression makes us do bad things - really guilt tripping stuff - and then said that the depression was probably the source of my pain. He refused to even investigate more, despite me curled up, moaning in pain. I managed to get another doctor in who gave me an ultrasound and discovered that my ovaries were riddled with cysts. Fuck that first doctor.
What are the 3 things you wish you knew before going to university?	1. You are a woman. 2. Get in to therapy and please choose an LGBTQA+ friendly one. 3. If you still fail, it's *okay.* You will be fine.	That I was an introvert, and therefore would not enjoy dorm life. That the value of going to university is actually the networking. ...Don’t have a third one.
Men, do all vaginas feel the same? If not, how do they vary?	Ive had sex with a lot of women (humblebrag) and they most certainly do not feel the same. I had sex with a few moms, and it felt like a cave. One of them was extremely in shape and it still felt like a warm cavern so the whole "they just need exercise to fix that" may not be 100%. Some sluts have tight vaginas, and some more reserved women have loose ones. Its just your body's biology. Everyone is different. Some of the cleanest girls have had the worst smells and some of the grimy girls I have fucked tasted and smelled excellent. No correlation between taste, smell, and feeling though. Still working on a hypothesis.	As a happily married man with an active sex life, I can tell you that even the SAME vagina doesn't feel the same all the time.
How do you diffuse your "Nice Guy" thought process?	Don't. Apportion your niceness such that it is equivalent to the level of deservedness of the object of its aim.	Re-frame the situation. You're not a nice guy getting rejected and you shouldn't focus on avoiding becoming a stereotypical 'nice guy'. Instead, you are a good person. Honestly, you are. Everyone can always be better though, so focus your energies on 'how can I be a good person'. This should steer your efforts towards living a fulfilling life. Reading books, studying, exploring the world around you as you go. I believe this is ultimately what will attract the right kinds of people to you, with the caveat that you do these things for yourself, and not in an attempt to impress anyone else. Self love, self confidence, and self direction - these are the ultimate attractors, go get you some.
Ladies of Reddit, what have you learned from Reddit?	I've learned that the reason why we are seeing so many "SJW" types gaining traction on campuses around the country and in the US is because so many people agree with that line of thinking. It's really alarming how much censorship there is on Reddit, and how common it's becoming to have a long list of opinions you cannot express because not hearing words that might be "triggering" or offensive is valued more than free speech. I fear for the society my kids are going to inherit one day.	On a different note from most of the responses, reddit has taught me how to purchase a used car and how to embroider.
What Is Something You Do That Is Considered Feminine But Do Because It Makes More Sense?	Treating women like they're ormal human beings... Also I'll pee sitting down at home too sometimes, it's about the only way you can really do it with morning wood	I go for a good mani/pedi and let them put clear polish on my nails. My feat are banged up from Army and before that, 15 years of football. I had some major ingrown toenails and crap. I took my wife to get her nails done, and the lady at the shop encouraged me to get mine done too. She basically was a godsend.
Do any of you suck at making lady friends like I do?	Bingo! Right here... I just get along better with men. I'm always so concerned I'll say the wrong thing to women. And I can't get into the whole "Your dress looks lovely!", "Where did you buy that purse ?", "so and so did this and that". Not saying that all women are like that or that there isn't an equivalent with guys... but in my experience men talk about funny things more... and that's my comfort zone. Just today a male co-worker joked about cutting his wrists... I told him to make sure he goes up and down, not across. Hilarious!	I'm the same way. I easily make acquaintances and have a hard time making close friends. For me, it seems to be that women want to bond with each other by being emotionally open. BUT, I want to be emotionally open AFTER we've bonded (this is the male "friendship progression", it seems to me). I feel like that makes other women think I don't like them! It's not truuuuuue.
What's your laughably horrible worst date story?	We went to watch a movie at her place. I brought the DVD's: two she didn't like and one she had seen shortly before. That's one thing. She picked the one she's seen before. During the film we sat on opposite ends of the couch and we didn't really talk. Near the end of the film her parents came home, which was awkward as well. In the end it worked out though.	It wasn't going well, I tried to end it by saying "well, this was fun. You live that way, I live the other, I'll text you." I walked 5 blocks home, only to realize she followed me.
Please tell me your experiences with not being close with your siblings in adulthood. Had it had negative consequences on you?	i came out as bi/lesbian woman and my brother who i was close to has quit talking to me, my oldest brother was super mean growing up and we never got close *ever*, and my little brother is sweet but introverted to a large degree. i wish i was close to a sibling	My brother and I don't talk. We're in our 30s, 3 years apart, and live in the same country. So we could talk, but we don't. We don't dislike each other (I don't dislike him and I don't think he dislikes me?) but we just don't talk. I don't think it really bothers me. I don't think it really bothers him. When we're visiting our dad together we still talk and bicker like we just saw each other yesterday. I don't feel any level of awkwardness that we didn't talk in the half year - year prior. I think it bugged my mom that we don't talk, though, I think she had a vision we'd be friends or close family as adults.
What should you absolutely ask for on your wedding registry?	Money. Edit: apparently this is unpopular, but that's normal where I'm from and the only useful wedding gift I received.	One of the best presents we got was a garbage can for the kitchen. Not just any garbage can it was this nice steel and black looking one that you don’t touch w your hands. You just tap it w your feet and it opens up. I’ve been married 9 years and it still works. It’s one of those things you don’t think to buy but when it lasts you quite a bit you realize that it’s a damn good present lol
Have you ever manipulated someone into loving you?	I was really in love with this girl but she wasn't feeling new so i told her I'd take her v card without catching feelings. 3 years later, were in bed naked right now and still together	...isnt that how it sorta works? Or do you mean on purpose? I tried as hard as hell to get my girlfriend to fall for me, and I think its worked because. Um. Girlfriend. I really do love her and i didnt do anything malicious like lie, but some days I still worry that I manipulated her in a bad way
How is 'being a man' different today then it was in previous decades?	I know one thing. Seems like men today have no guarantees and everyone wants to sue them.. These days it's nothing to have your wife leave out of boredom and take everything you own.. Then send you a monthly bill.	I think today with all the talk of gender roles, sexism, fluidity, what is a man depends on who you ask. What this means is whatever type of man you are, you have to own it, Because any type of man can be attacked as being the wrong type. You like to work out and watch sports- stereotypical dude. You like to play video games- nerd. Skinny guy that dresses nice- metro. Work on a ranch- red neck. You just have to be you, ignore all the bullshit.
Does it ever piss you off when another person tries to tell you how to do something you know how to do? What do you do or say?	It used to. Then I grew up. Let people teach you. It makes them feel better and makes you look like a fast learner. You might even learn something in the process. If they find out later that you obviously know your shit, it makes you look like a good person for taking time to listen to them.	There's a great buddhist story about this. I'm not a buddhist, so I'm probably going to get the details wrong. Gist is: a buddha --whose meditation practice had led him to enlightenment-- was wandering the land. He kept running into "meditation teachers" who offered to give him instruction and guidance on how to meditate. His response, as a master? He hung on their every word, and when they were finished with their "instruction" he thanked them profusely and humbly went on his way. He made no attempt to teach or correct them, unless they asked. It's a story about pride and ego.
Guys, what's something cool that you do for yourself on your birthday?	I eat rich chocolate cake covered in double cream with a nice beer to go with it- it's a rare treat and something I only allow myself on my birthday. Birthdays aren't inherently special but it#s not tricky to make them that way :)	I really don't give a shit about my birthday but if I did, I'd probably take the day off work, not put on pants, stay well away from any type of productive activity, and spend the day drinking, napping, and playing video games.

What is the worst thing you've accidentally said to a guy?	Not a girl, but my ex and I were talking about my parents' divorce, which they were in the middle of finalizing, and she said "your dad is not as good a parent you think he is, and he's a worse husband". Turns out she had spoken quite a bit with my mom about it and had a biased opinion. She immediately apologized and said that's not what she meant. She never did clarify exactly what she was trying to say... Edit: I think my dad is an awesome person, who never abused me or my mom in any way, shape or form. So my ex's comment was unwarranted	I was sleeping with a guy that was about 7 years older than me and I really liked him. One morning he apologized if he snored too loudly and without thinking I said, "It's okay my dad snores really loud too so I'm used to it."
Whats your opinion on men using makeup?	I think as long as they keep it minimal (to still represent as masculine) its an OOOOKAY for me^^ i actually introduced bf to skincares and bb cream, nothing for the brow and eyes tho. Cause boi his eyebrow is just purrrrfect. 🤣	Do whatever makes you feel like the most authentic version of you. If it makes you happy then go for it !
What's the meanest thing you've done without realizing to someone you liked?	I asked the woman I was dating at the time to marry me over text message. We'd only been together 7 months, so I thought she'd know I was kidding. However, we'd known each other for ten years and already lived together (we were roommates first, maintained separate rooms because I snore), and she thought given all that I wasn't kidding. She said yes and sent me a ;) - I thought she was playing along - and by the next time I got a chance to actually talk to her that evening, she'd already told her parents, etc. Whoops.	There was a boy that I was really flirty with at school. I was kind of a "late bloomer" in terms of dating compared to my peers, I had bad self esteem and was kind of in disbelief that someone would like me. He asked me on a date and I not even told him no even though I was crushing on him hard, I thought he was making fun of me and I told him no fucking way ew gross fuck the fuck off. And then kicked him in the shins on his way out. Ok no, not the shins part, but that was probably what it felt like. I didn't realize until years later that he was probably genuinely asking and I felt horrible. I hope he's doing alright.
Teenage boy bedroom stink; when did your room stop stinking? How did it not bother you?	I didn’t know dudes like that exist Fuck... stashing trash under the bed Wearing shit and stashing it Basically living in a basement environment with the dark conditions Why do guys do that unless they’re depressed	It similar to the problem of people with chronic body odour.... A lot of them don’t know they have it or how bad it is. He probably needs a shock from someone... Hearing an outsider saying how bad it is, something like that.
Woman, when was a time you cut a friend out of your life even though they were a good person?	In high school I had 3 girlfriends and we would hang out alright but due to some personal problems I started comparing myself to them and being really secretive. So I figured that it would be best I cut them off so no one would get hurt.	This may sound petty but they never had time for me. Always had time for other things but never for me. It was constant flake after flake and disappointment.
How would you want the girl you are seeing to tell you she found out she has an STI?	meh, forget all of these truth tellers. call him up screaming mad. tell him that HE gave it to YOU. then he'll have to feel sorry about it and you can manipulate him into some presents, fancy dinners, and endless apologies	I've had this happen. Just call him and tell him. There's no good way to tell him. Just mention he should get tested and that's that.
Have you ever found something out about someone you care about (friend, family, ex/current SO) that changed the way you view them? What happened? Were you able to "get over it" or get things back to normal?	Found out my dad was big into the PUA and men's rights communities. Still on good terms with him but I avoid talking to him about women/dating because he comes off as incredibly misogynistic.	Found out two friends were having an emotional affair with each other, behind their SO's backs. They ended up getting together officially while leaving behind the emotional wreckage of their previous relationships. There was a huge breakup. At first I thought "Well I'll just keep on being friends with everyone." But the combination of everyone shunning them, and me thinking about how shitty they are, slowly distanced them from most friends. I still say hi and make small talk if I see them, but that's about it.
What kinds of AskMen threads are the saddest to read?	The ones from the depressed guys who don't get how to get laid and make women attracted to them, and who get butthurt, angry and downvotey when you tell them how because it doesn't match their (obviously failing) worldview on the matter.	The kind where you see a normally decent guy getting so fucked up by rejection/horrible people that he starts to drift into extremist views to somehow manage and cope with all that has happened around him.
Since leggings are definitely pants, which brands/kinds/hidden treasures can I actually WEAR as pants?	I really liked by Victoria's Secret yoga pants, but I'm really (finally!) over the company and how they portray women. Between the crazy photoshopping and having Justin Bieber dance around on stage with VS models, I just can't support the brand anymore. Apparently lululemon have nice ones but apparently the founder's a jerk. The struggle is real.	If you don't mind the label being visible then Under Armour makes great leggings. I have one pair that's six years old with only minor pilling.
How do I keep telling the guy I’m dating that I’m not comfortable sending him nude pics?	What he's doing is DEFINITELY not acceptable. You shouldn't have to feel pressured to send nudes to keep a guy when you're uncomfortable with it. You don't have to feel guilty for not doing it and you don't owe him anything beyond "I'm uncomfortable with it". "So my question is, how big of a red flag is this? " That's for you to decide. I'd recommend communicating more sternly and clearly before you call it quits. If he still pushes, he's probably not the one. Oh and fuck him for saying he'll ask other girls. Honestly that's a bigger red flag for me than insisting. I'd tell him to go ahead and finish the thing right there.	I think I'm too old for this question, cuz to me if you're seeing some dude for 3 months and seeing him for a date or hookup weekly that's pretty much a boyfriend. If he's not respecting your boundaries it's better to learn it now than later. Especially when he's basically said if you won't someone else will. Tell him to text another girl and delete your number.
Fellow men, how do YOU handle the "nothing" phone call?	I too have noticed this tendency of women to call you up and discuss nothing. My wife does it to me all the time - usually she picks the most inconvenient time to call - a time when she knows that I'll be in the middle of cooking dinner. Sigh..... It's an annoying tendency many women have - but it is harmless and, if it makes them feel better, then why not engage them. Women and men are different, and its better that we try to accommodate those differences.	1. ask her any question 2. ask a question about her answer 3. relate 4. repeat eg, 1. Do you like bacon? 2. Why not? 3. yeah, I hear you. It is sad to see the pictures of pigs in tiny cages that the PETA volunteers pass out downtown by Frank's Bar. 4. Ever go to Frank's Bar? The structure will quickly dissolve because you'll have hit on some common interest and you'll be asking questions and relating anecdotes because you are actually interested and engaged in the subject. Bonus round: when you relate, make a joke or witty observation or gently poke fun at her, get her laughing. Expert mode: make those jokes flirtatious. Sprinkle in very light innuendo.
Who is your "she is so pretty it hurts" girl?	Anllela Sagra, [you're welcome](https://instagram.com/anllela_sagra/?hl=en) and it's SFW btw. Without her I don't know why I choose to continue my miserable existence.	A girl I used to know in the rooms was that girl. I'd get all nervous when she talked to me and start stuttering. She'd walk in when I'm in the middle of speaking and "Dream Weaver" starts playing in my head while I gawk at her in front of a room full of people. And now the big kick in the balls, she's a lesbian.
Do you get anxious when other people use your computer?	I get incredibly anxious. I've also just always been a paranoid person. As long as I am not using the internet for school/work, I will go on incognito mode. I do not use Microsoft Outlook and only check my email on the internet. And of course, I log off after every single time. I think I have a problem...	Yes. Occasionally my SO asks to borrow my phone to look something up because his isn't handy. I always insist on looking it up myself. He will also sometimes scroll through my pictures out of boredom. I have nothing worth hiding on my phone and I trust him completely but it's still extremely uncomfortable and I hate it. I am way more strict with my laptop. Absolutely no one touches it but me. It has more sensitive information like my personal budgets, work info, etc. I also save all of my writing on there and *nobody* gets to read anything I don't send them myself.
Ladies, what situations do you have no pity for?	People who assault police officers. Cops are doing their job by enforcing laws to keep people safe. If you can't respect authority figures, think you're above the law, and think it's okay to threaten bodily harm or assault them, well, that's on you, buddy. You deserve whatever you get. Everyone wants to cry "POLICE BRUTALITY!", but the fact of the matter is, assaulting a cop is a felony. Not to mention, if you were being assaulted, wouldn't you fight back and attempt to restrain that person? I know I would. EDIT: Nice to know the consensus supports harming our police officers. All I can say is, "WOW". Keep it up, and we won't have a lot of police officers left to keep us safe. SMH	People who spend their money frivolously and then complain about being broke... I want to say - If you didn't spent $10 every day on lunch then you wouldn't be so broke. They have all of these choices yet it's always someone else's fault and so many end being my co-workers somehow. I chose to live alone and I have less spending money but I think that is worth not having a roommate. My co-worker chose a luxury apartment instead of one of the many safe, cheaper apartments in the area and loves to complain about how broke she is. See above - she also spends quite a bit on lunch and somehow I should feel sorry for her when the day before payday she has to go cheap and get McDonald's (and she still orders a more expensive meal instead of dollar menu items). No sympathy for that crap.
Books that every girl should read?	Eleanor and Park. I'm so in love with that novel. I think it's a great coming of age story for a teenage girl.	If you've never been poor, I'd highly recommend Nickel and Dimed. It's a nonfiction book where the author attempts to live in three different cities in the US on low wages. It all seems intuitive to me but I grew up poor - for friends who haven't been, it's been really eye opening to see all of the costs associated with being poor. For example, if you can't afford to pay for the deposit on an apartment, you get stuck paying high prices to live in a hotel. Because you're paying more to live in the hotel than you would in rent, you can never save up for that deposit. Whereas someone who is doing okay financially, or can borrow money from parents or something, they're able to pay the deposit and get a cheaper apartment.
Identical twin Men, are your beards the same when they grow out too?	I'm not a twin, but me and my older brother look a lot alike except for our height difference. Our beards are almost identical in color and fullness and we currently have them trimmed to the same length. If you took a snapshot of just our bottom jaws, I think you'd have a hard time telling who is who. So I'd have to imagine twins would have the same.	I'm not sure about all, but my twin and I have the same beard growth and our beard and head hair are graying in the exact same places.

Women who have shaved their head completely bald. How was it? Do you regret it? Is it exciting? Terrifying?	As a 60+ male, whose been shaved (that way I can tell people: I'm shaved, not bald) since my mid-30's, all I can say is that it ALL depends on the shape of your skull (male or female) as to how well you can pull of the look. Men tend to have squarer skulls and sometimes shaved doesn't look right for them. Women, on average, have more oval shaped skulls, and the shaved look actually looks good on them. I personally find women with shaved or very short hair attractive.	I never did, but I lost my hair from chemotherapy for cancer. I was very attached to my hair before (long and thick) but I felt beautiful bald. I never expected it. I was almost sad when my hair grew back.
People always say “Pick a partner with flaws you can deal with.” What’s your partner’s flaw you deal with and why is it something you are willing to look past?	Noticed lots of women (and one man?) saying their pet peeves are their man's laziness or messiness. Idk if us women should have to settle for that kind of behavior...	My boyfriend plays the guitar but over the past 6 years he keeps playing the same 5 songs. Whatever floats his boat though
What hobbies do you have?	I used to have many hobbies! But now that I am growing a tiny human I mainly lay on the couch groaning from extreme morning sickness and announcing to my husband that I'm dying and that it's too hot in the house stop touching the damn thermostat	I crochet, cross stitch, scrapbook, garden... Basically I'm a 30 year old grandma. I like quiet hobbies where I can just happily sit and create while listening to music or Netflix or whatever. Edit: I've found my people, haha 😂 Cheers to all my fellow grandma's! Our club is officially open!
Men who were skinny then became muscular and bigger. How would you say your life changed socially after you made your gains?	I've become more muscular, but it only is visible by my actions. I don't *look* strong, but people forget muscle is dense. Since I don't look muscular, everyone still thinks me as just thin.	Socially, I get made fun of for having muscles in a sarcastic way. As far as dating, I am more attractive, but I'm still the same pussy I was when I was skinny. So overall, not really much has changed.?
Divorced men, What are some things to keep in mind before getting married?	that if things don't work out and end in Divorce, you have no idea how bad the entire process is biased against you. The short version is you will stand to lose everything (children, house, retirement, toys, etc.), while all she really stands to lose is the pleasure of your company. Divorce tends to turn a man into an indentured servant. She may not know or want that now, but years after watching her friends do it and laugh about it during wine night, it will at min. change the dynamic in your relationship	Marriage will not change your spose for the better. It's not a solution to any problem. If there is a mismatch with libido then misery follows. When sex is good it is 25% of the relationship. But when sex is bad it can become 75%.
What was something mean you did to your girlfriend/wife that made them cry?	Nothing. I don't do mean things to her that make her cry. I know that's "too uptight" a relationship by reddit's standards, but the advantage is that my conscience is clear as crystal. What few incidents of carelessness there have been, have been so minor that she doesn't even remember them - and they were nowhere near enough to move her to tears.	When she was pregnant I stomped her ass in monopoly. She cried Everytime she landed on one of my FOUR railroads. Edit: I forgot to mention the outcome. I just gave her all my railroads for free. She cried again because it was sweet. I still won, she cried again. Pregnancy is funny like that.
Who do you have a crush on at the moment?	I have a crush on my SO, but also on other people: A coworker at my last job tops the list, and I’m 100% certain it’s a mutual crush. We’re friends though, and though the mutual attraction is unspoken, we know where we stand. Our friendship goes through cycles of being hot and cold, so it’s for the best that I don’t see him on a daily basis anymore. Right now I have a fascination with my new coworker. It’s not a full out crush in the old school sense of blushing and butterflies, but he’s the one I’m always seeking out first and spending afternoon coffee breaks with. When the shininess wears off, I’m pretty sure this is a friendship crush.	A quiet guy I went to university with. He texts me randomly and we’ve met up (very) few times. He’s made it clear that he wants to get to know me but I’m not sure if it’s because he wants to be just friends. I might relocate for a new job so that would definitely stop our minimal relationship from growing. The struggles of being a shy person liking a shy person.
I want to propose to my bf with a custom magic card. Can you guys help me?	Sorry, but I have to use this rare opportunity to try to understand women who propose to their boyfriends. Why do you want to do this? Do you feel like he won't do it on his own in any forseeable future (if so, what makes you think he'll say yes?) or do you simply want to score hipster points for defying the gender roles? Have you considered the possibility that he might see this as you emasculating him?	Make it an equipment artifact. Name: Master Sword of Matrimony. Target player gains control of this card when it enters play. Equip cost 0: This equipment cannot be removed. Combine both players' life totals, hands, decks, graveyards, and permanents. Both players win the game. (EDIT: You could also make this an enchantment that has the same ability without the equip nomenclature, but it seems like an equipment theme matches the sword. Also, I think this is adorable and great!)
How does it make you feel if a girl submits herself all to you sexually?	It's a total turn off and I interpret it as laziness. I'm not looking for a real doll. I'm looking for someone who wants to do nasty stuff with me and who is going to participate and has their own preferences and things they want to try. Sometimes I wanna use them sure. But sometimes I like them taking the lead.	You people who say its lazy are doing it wrong man. Submission is a mental game not just physical. It doesn't mean she wants to starfish while you do your thing, she wants to be told what to do. I find it super hot because theres someone there saying "getting you off is what gets me off" basically. Also girls who push back a bit and test your dynamic are real hot, like they want to be submissive but won't make it so easy.
Men of Reddit, what are some reasons why you would go dark after a first date that went well?	"Hello, I know I could ask him clear question, but I felt like a bunch of randos from the internet could be mindreaders and do it for me." Maybe he actually doesn't like you, maybe he found someone else, maybe he doesn't have time, maybe he learned you have herpes and your herpes has 3 hepatitis. Who knows.	Couple times this happened to me, it turned out the dude wasn't really done with his ex. You have to be careful not to get too invested in first dates. Both parties might genuinely have a great time, but the other person has a whole life you don't know about. Don't take it personally without good evidence that it's personal.
Of the two big boybands (NSYNC, BSB), which member did you think was best looking? Are you ashamed of your answer today, or are you sticking to it?	Um. New Edition was my boy band. I hated NKOTB (my BFFs dad had the same agent and I heard their demo, though.) I'm too old for NSync.	I was always more of a BSB fangirl, and loved me some AJ. For NSYNC, I would have to go with Lance. However, I've also noticed almost all of my teen celebrity crush have came out as gay. I seem to have a sixth sense for lusting after the ones who would never return the favor.
What do you think about letting your child wear a bikini? How do you explain your rule to her?	I just wanted to point out that high schools are banning yoga pants for this exact reason, in the U.S. Creepers can't be held responsible for the temptation of assaulting young girls? So it's the victim's fault for their own assault/rape basically. Maybe these misguided and troubled individuals need to have some accountability and consequence. Yes, I'm going to echo the others and say a bikini swimsuit is perfectly fine on a little girl.	My daughters have always had to wear two piece bathing suits (they're 18 now) because they're very tall, and have long backs. They definitely weren't the only girls in their peer group growing up who wore two piece bathing suits. As other people have said, creeps will find anything to creep about. For every person who might have in appropriate thoughts about a child in a bikini, there's another one who would find more modest swimwear a turn-on. 8 is a great time to start having these types of conversations with her, if you're not doing it already. You don't have to get into the nuts and bolts of sexuality and clothes, but you can start talking about choices, and fashion, and peer groups etc.
Have you noticed any differences dating girls who self-identify as feminists, vs girls who don't?	Yes. They vote liberal, you cannot make certain jokes to your friends, and they are not great at understanding the other side of the argument.	I'm sure I've dated some, but it's never really come up. I suppose that means it's mostly a non-issue. Only exception was I did briefly see someone that thought boys falling behind in schools was some sort of comeuppance. I ended up bailing for other reasons, but that definitely wasn't a turn on.
If you hit on a "girl" and then "she" politely told you "she" was a dude what do you think your reaction be?	I would apoligize. Trans women can be very attractive but I just can't get past the cock n'balls part. Granted, some people can and that's great but probably apologize as I don't mean to offend.	It would kill any romantic interest there. But not any friendly interests. It would provide a very interesting conversation topic.
Small Update: My 14 year old brother is really perverted and inappropriate. How can I let him know some things are not okay to say?	I'm surprised you didn't rat him out for watching porn on mom's ipad. I would have. (that, and smacked him upside the head).	Good to hear your bro has changed. You have *no idea* how much embarrassment you've just saved him. I knew some guys in high school who were like him and eventually matured, but don't talk about their high school years because they cringe so hard at how they behaved.
Why is it that some men often come off as oblivious to the fact that they're handsome and the fact that someone is attracted to them?	As an attractive male i was always oblivious unwanted female attention. Connection requires both parties to pickup the phone. The difference between men and women is that women will use unwanted male attention to setup backup boyfriends or get free shit or cry victimhood.	Part of it is because what a lot of women think are "obvious hints" of attraction aren't really obvious at all.
How bad does IUD insertion actually hurt?	My GF just got her second one (after her first one fell out after a few weeks - luckily she noticed). Hate to tell you, but she described it as the worst pain she ever had...	It was very uncomfortable for 2-3 minutes, then I had a day of period-like cramping which was relieved by Advil.
Girls/Guys who took advice from askmen, what happened? Did it work?	Askmen told me to wait for the guy I liked to make a move on me instead of telling him myself how I felt. So I waited. And shortly thereafter he did. And now we're together. And it's awesome. I mean it probably would have worked out either way, but I'd like to think that Askmen is at least a little responsible haha.	"You worrying and obsessing over her cheating isn't going to stop her from doing it. If she's going to cheat she's going to cheat regardless of how much you obsess." This really helped me get past some issues I have. I was able to let go of my insecurities when she goes out with her friends and just live my life.
Guys with objectively attractive partners, what are the downsides of dating someone objectively beautiful?	Even if you’re not the jealous type, men constantly hitting on your partner gets old. Also, as was said earlier, a lot of those girls have little to no personality.	I have to wonder what she saw in me. I’m the most average person and for some reason she actually likes being with me. Others have questioned it as well, like “how the hell did he land her of all people?”
What is an opinion you have, that is generally unpopular amongst other men?	Stop reporting things just because you disagree. If they're actually breaking rules, go ahead. But stop using the report button as a "my opinion is better" button EDIT: Also, you weirdos reporting this comment aren't as original as you think you are.

What's the most fucked up thing you have done to a woman and do you regret it?	Posted her nudes online, shared them with everyone she new, fucked up her "relationships" by warning her other boyfriends who then broke up with her. Why? Cause she was the biggest cunt you can imagine, was dating like 5 guys at once. Posted the nudes after she tried to break up my new relationship by shittalking me to my new GF who luckily didn't care. Only thing I regret is dating her.	In university a couple girls in my class approached me and insisted that I go out with their friend who I'd sat next to once or twice and nothing else. I gave her a look and she was pretty enough so I said to them, "sure, we'll hang out over the summer." I had forgotten that I had a flight that evening and was spending the summer with my family in France. I completely forgot she even existed until I saw her again in a lecture and thought, "Oh Neptune."
Why is depression so prevalent in modern age?	Because life is too damn easy for SO many people these days. There's less struggle (for many), which has led to a bunch of ungrateful, entitled fucking brats who are unfulfilled in life, and ultimately end up depressed. Fucking whaa...you don't get a trophy, because you SUCK!	Read “tribe” by sebastian junger, it’s only about 100 pages but is the best explanation I’ve found for it. The larger and more spread out we get, the less “relevant” we feel in the world. Everyone in a tribe has a place and a purpose. Without imminent threats to our survival and such an easy padded life, we have nothing to overcome or accomplish. He did an interview on joe rogan’s podcast too if you want a condensed version of it. He’s a pretty bright guy.
Guys, have you ghosted someone? If so, for what reason?	Honestly, I get that it's like not the right thing to do or whatever. But, I don't know why everyone gets so bent out of shape about it. I've been ghosted. I've ghosted people. It's basically fine. Frustrating, maybe, but everything about dating is frustrating. Just comes with the territory. It always just means that the ghoster has stopped caring about the ghostee. Which is fine. I guess you could say that not reaching out and officially ending things is shitty, but the fastest, easiest way to get rid of someone you don't care about anymore is to be shitty towards them. And, people are tired, man. It's just the path of least resistance sometimes.	If I match with them, I try my best not to ghost. And if it won't work out, I'll let them know that in a respectful manner. I just go under the assumption people like being treated as adults, and I myself wouldn't like to be ghosted either. So far I haven't ghosted anyone I've matched or went out with.
What are the most confusing "signals" a guy has given you?	Recently I met a guy who I was super into. He started texting me in a way that gave the vibe he was into me, not in a booty call way but in a "hey how are you?" relationship way. I was excited to go to a party where I knew he'd be at. We had a great time at the party but..Well this other girl was very drunk and all over him and it made me upset so I had to leave. As soon as I get up to go he gives me a bear hug. ???!? Idk my brain still hurts. Also alcohol.	I had a guy who would tell me he loved me then ignore me for a week. Then he'd see me somewhere randomly and tell me how beautiful I was. Then he'd ignore me for another week. And it was just set on repeat for awhile. I was sooo infatuated with that asshole.
What's that 'thing' that hurts but you constantly lie to yourself that it's fine?	When you're having sex and you push so hard just to bash a head against a headboard, while of course having a tongue between the teeth. You keep going like a pro and suck it up. But deep down even the dick is crying.	Loneliness. I have acquaintances and people like me. Few people really like me enough to be friends with me and I spend most of my time alone. I'm used to it but it eats away at you.
I was supposed to buy professional clothing, but I ended up buying another cute print dress instead...AskWomen, where do you guys get your work clothing?	I'm kind of tomboyish. I buy khakis from Old Navy, shirts and sweaters from American Eagle, and wear a pair of nice sneakers (Vans).	I really like NY&CO for basic business attire, and I find a lot of good stuff at Nordstrom's Rack, Marshall's and TJ Max. The professional women I work with love to find stuff at Steinmart. Yet for daily work wear I gravitate towards print dresses, cardigans, and ballet flats... And my industry is super-conservative (investments/banking). I'd probably take one of my dresses and add a good tailored jacket, a good bag, and statement heels for an interview. You don't necessarily need to wear a pantsuit to look professional.
What are some immediate deal-breakers for dating?	Just 1, and it's if they are homophobes. I pulled this trick twice in my life, but it was worth. Just as a casual question in a date, I ask them what they think about homosexual people. If they call em disgusting, I go with it and don't say anything. Then I wait patiently till I have her in my bed, have rough sex with her and when we are done I wait for the question "Did you like it?". My answer both times was "It was ok, but my exboyfriend was better at blowjobs" (which was true both times). Then you wait for that confused look into that realitzation that I like guys too. That moment is fucking great.	I think the crazy ex thing is pretty universal, I've heard it from plenty of girls too. I've heard plenty of them explain their previous relationships as something like: 'I was doing nothing wrong at all, and was completely right in every conversation we had, then one day he just changed and got really angry and left because he wasn't a real man'. There's nothing inherently wrong with having a crazy person in your past, the thing that turns me off is when people have no insight into it, and take no ownership over their past mistakes.
What are the not so obvious qualities of a good boyfriend?	Lots of good advice in this thread, but honestly, I find it sad that all this wouldn't be more obvious.	My boyfriend does such little insignificant things but I find it super sweet. For example, foldy chips are my favourite. Every time he finds a folded chip in the bag he tries to give it to me. Like for five years this has been going on.
What is something you feel guilty about doing but continue to do it anyways?	Drinking coffee and other liquids as a substitute for a meal. Like, I don't deliberately set out to drink a coffee or a smoothie in lieu of a meal, but I have such a small appetite that a coffee would make me feel full for hours afterwards.	Tossing a fistful of Cheerios on the carpet by my feet, for my 1-year-old to eat. Hey sometimes, she's freaking out and throwing a fit, I'm trying to get something important done, and I know it will distract her for awhile as she hunts for them all...
What is pretty shitty to be judgmental about?	I judge people's education level. I shouldn't and admit I'm shitty for it, but if a person offers me an opinion or tries telling me how much they "know" about something, their education level plays on how quickly I dismiss it as something I should care about or not.	Anything a person can't change. I mean you can judge sure, it's in our nature, however don't go up to a girl with peach fuzz and say "girl what's with your mustache?"
Ladies, how do you stop yourself from crying during an argument or stressful situation?	We as women should not have to hide our normal emotional reactions. If our brains are telling us to have a certain emotion. Then perceives that as crying to “feel” the rush of chemicals aka the feeling... then so be it. Arguments or stress are both perceived by the brain differently in everyone. Do not let any boyfriend, family member, friend, coworker, husband, etc make you feel wrong for showing emotions. It is not a manipulation, it is a normal bodily function brought on brain chemicals. A reaction of our higher brain function. Certain animals “cry” why not us? This what happens when you read a few philosophy chapters and get stoned an hour before bed. Seriously though, crying is normal and more people should let it out so to speak. Hugs!	As an angry-crier, I just find a way to exit the scenario saying among the lines of " I can't talk right now" so I can visibly calm down and regain my composure.
What are the early signs of a one sided relationship?	I feel sad that this question had to be asked. I will admit to being in bad relationships but I always knew it and wanted something physical anyway so for those cases relax and enjoy the fireworks in bed. If you want more and have a bad feeling you know what to do but are not willing to end it. That is all you if you know and continue anyway. You do know, it is that simple.	The other party puts in the bare minimum of effort. You're always going over to *their* place, they never bother to come to yours. Or when you want to see them/talk to them, they don't text you back... they only want to interact with you when they don't have anything 'better' to do.
I've noticed women act differently when I tell them my real name. What are your thoughts on men with feminine names?	If you were Korean or something, I wouldn't even think twice about it. But I can't say I've ever heard that name used for men in other nationalities besides Asian. Otherwise, it might strike me as odd for a split second and then I would proceed to give no craps. I've known dudes named "Shannon" and I find that a lot more feminine than Kim.	My partner and I both have unisex names that are frequently mistaken for belonging to the opposite gender. Confusion abounds, and it is beautiful.
Is non-exclusivity the default status during dating?	Yes, non-exclusivity is the default, and the default stands until there is conversation where exclusivity is discussed in plain English and both parties agree.	If it is, this is a new thing. I've only seen this assumption floating around in the last few years. To me, this just seems like a particularly weasel-like way to obtain cart-blanche for philandering in the early stages of a relationship. I'd never date anyone who thought this was okay. The *default* for me is exclusivity, and really, if in doubt doesn't that seem like the more honest choice?
Those who are in a serious/long-term relationship but don't plan to marry, how do you explain it to people that ask why?	I don't submit to the traditional expectations of marriage and find the entire institution to be archaic, and unnecessary. When it comes to explaining it to people, nowadays (at least my environment) honesty about this doesn't feel as weird as it used to. I don't get as much judgement about it now compared to maybe 10 years ago people would scrunch their nose at me about it.	I usually make a joke about how I don't want to rush into anything since we've only just been dating for over a decade.
What is your thought process when seeing a picture of an attractive naked woman?	I would tell her that she doesn't have to do this, that she's better than this, tell her to put some sweatpants and one of my old shirts on and that we can talk about who hurt her. I call this the Drake approach.	Well that *is* a nice pussy. I don't really have a thought process. I think my mind goes primitive because there's never any speaking going on in there. It's just like... I really like that, she's cute, I'd fuck her, but without words and all at the same time in my mind.
Women who are sexually active, do you believe that women are able to have sex without any emotions involved before and after the fact?	Nope. Both men and women. There are always emotions involved, it's how we are wired. At the same time, humans can suppress their emotions and dissociate them.	I don't think gender comes into play in this. Male or female some people just can have it empty and some people need emotions linked
What beauty habit/tip really upped your attractiveness level?	Getting a tan. I don't even feel like I need make up when I have glowy tanned skin. Getting a short hair cut (side cut with little hair flipped on the other side) combined with large/antique earrings. Face jewelry (like a lip piercing)	Always wash your face and brush your teeth before bed. Always always always, no matter how much partying you did that night.
What mistakes do male writers commonly make when writing female characters?	OP I'm going to ignore your question and get to the heart of your worry and I'm going to be blunt: You need to read books by women about women. This is the only way you're going to improve.	Making women TOO badass. And then, suddenly, it's because some dude did something to her. It's fine to be delicate, vulnerable. You don't have to be an ass kicking, violent hardass to be a strong woman. You don't even have to be a strong woman. You can just be a woman in a story. Women who are not people. Who don't have their own motivations, own pasts. Who stink of "prop for protagonist" instead of being fully defined people who live their own lives off the page. I majored in Creative Writing. Even the character your protagonist passes on the street should have a story; it doesn't matter if you're the only person who knows it.
Why do I become overly attached girls?	>I got out of a 3 month relationship That's a relationship in high school, not for grown ups. I think it's reasonable to still not be labeled bf/gf at 3 months. >I was completely inlove with her I doubt it. It sounds like your just experiencing some immature feelings of infatuation. Enjoy it before you get too old and jaded.	Get a hobby. I go to the gym, travel, read, write, watch interesting movies, explore my city, hang out with friends,... I don't have time to obsess over girls !
What is something you realized later in life that you really should know how to do?	Managing a menstrual cycle. I was 25 and still ruining sheets. Just totally unpredictable. I just got an IUD instead. Problem solved!	I really should know how to fold fitted sheets instead of stuffing them into my linen closet in a giant ball.... I’ll be 90 and still not know how.
Women who use tampons, do you ever accidentally “push” out your tampon while trying to poop?	If that happens, the tampon is probably not inserted deep enough. It usually doesn't come out only from pushing, that's why there's a string attached.	Not hard enough to completely come out but I have had problems where it will slip down to an uncomfortable position. So I usually just remove it before I poop.
women of reddit, what are some awesome small/cheap presents you'd like to receive?	Flowers... I've only ever gotten flowers twice (I think it's super cute when the guy picks them instead of buying them) lol something I need, or something that reminded him of me. It's not really about the object more so they were think about me when they didn't have to be. It makes me feel special 💚	Could be anything. I appreciate the sentiment of "I saw this and it made me think of you and I had to get it for you" way more than whatever the thing is.
What do you do when your S.O. tries to police your "likes" on social media?	Get a new S.O? Nobody tells me what to do. NOBODY. ANy man that allows his SO to police him like that is lacking a penis.	> break up with her /r/AskMen advice in a nutshell A slightly more optimistic approach: Don't play this game. Never get into arguments why or why not she you liked something, because her policing is an expression of her immaturity and/or insecurity. Instead, try to find the root cause (WHY is she so insecure about it) and work on that and make her feel secure. Try to tell her that you feel it's an invasion of your privacy. If that doesn't work, well, might have to actually let her go. The above only applies if you're not actually going through exes or random hot girls profiles and just like everything. In that case stop doing that, that would weird most people out too.
Gents of Reddit, have you had either of your parents commit infidelities. If so, does it make you more determined to be faithful, or does the apple never rot far from the tree?	Unless it is habitual during early child development, cheating isn't going to have an effect on the likelihood of an adult cheating. Cheating occurs because one party in the relationship is not having their (usually emotional) needs met. It is a symptom of a relationship that is in trouble, not a symptom of something wrong with the cheater.	Dad ran out on my mom when he found out she was preggers with me. I'm Planning on being there for my wife and child till the very end.
How often do you get told to smile?	Too often. It's kinda hard because my face easily disconnects from my emotions and false attempts make me look off.	My mom says it occasionally. Otherwise never, nobody walks around the production floor or the gym with a silly grin all day.
What has been your most bizarre interaction with a redditor?	Somewhere I do believe I asked someone not to call me a "female" because it dehumanizes me and women in general - he wouldn't say "some of my friends are male" - he used "guys" - but he was saying "some of my friends are female" so... I got this amazing hilarious screed about how I was a fat, forever alone redheaded feminazi. I'm still puzzled at how being redheaded might be insulting….	Someone posted a question asking if I would ever shave my head, then PM'd me and offered to fly to my city and pay me to shave my head, then said he would bring his girlfriend as if that was insurance that they weren't going to murder me.
What is something Redditors advise/advise against about dating &amp; relationships that you disagree with?	I think that telling someone their partner cheated on them is 99.9% of the time a terrible idea. Unless you have irrefutable evidence, just leave it alone. It's not your relationship to proctor.	This isn't really a Reddit thing, but I often see it in TV and movies where the protagonist is encouraged to confess their feelings to someone they're interested in, when that someone is already in a relationship that the protag knows about. "Tell them how you feel" they'll be advised. Seriously, never do this. Don't go trying to sabotage other people's relationships just because you have a crush. Whether it works or not, you're a douche.
Single men, how does your week look?	When I was single, all I would do is spend time on myself and my hobbies. I'd spend time with family and friends, I'd go shopping, sometimes alone, and take myself out. Honestly it's made me a better partner now because I know what I'm into, what I'm not, and really used it as an opportunity to find myself. Date yourself! Treat you to a cup of coffee or go see a movie alone. People say it's depressing but seeing a movie by yourself carries some serious big dick energy in my opinion. Go dancing or clubbing, go eat at a fancy restaurant, go to a wine tasting. Learn to be your own best friend and spend time with yourself. Not only will this help you heal but it'll also be fun!	Work, take care of the house, practice sports to stay healthy, read books. play games, watch movies, reserve a couple of days every month to be with friends. Repeat. Single adulthood for the majority of people gets repetitive and boring, despite what facebook and instagram shows. If you value your own company, don't stress out, stay healthy and keep improving yourself. If you've never been in this position, now it's a good to start doing just that.
For the mothers- what age did you have your first child? If you could go back, would you have waited or would you have gotten pregnant earlier?	My most recent GF broke up with me because she wants a baby badly. She 43. I have a 7 yo and don’t want another, rather invited her in to my and his life but that was not enough. I think 43 is a little late to get started.	37. I only wish I had started earlier because I'll be 60 when my youngest (born when I was 42) goes to college and I'd prefer to retire earlier than 64 when he (hopefully) gets out of school. But I didn't even start dating my husband until I was almost 34 and THANK GOD I never had kids with any of my previous boyfriends.
Who has made a significant impact on the way you live your life and why?	Significant.. my parents. Taught me all i don't want to be. And recently, Ayn Rand. The Fountainhead was a conclusion i had trouble putting into words myself.	My best friend. Helped him build a $40 million dollar company over 4 years and he laid me off and gave me a $10k check.
Fathers of Reddit. What Cool Stuff can i show my 4 year old son?	Girl here, but very much raised a tomboy. My dad used to take me to this model train store. I know they're independent small businesses, there may not be one where you live. But damn they blew my mind. I would stay for hours and admire them. We built one together at home.	From an old guy, It depends on what your child likes but for me, We built awesome Lego structures together. We made potions (food coloring+ baking soda + vinegar was a favorite) went on adventures/hikes. My oldest wasn't into sports or cars so I had to adjust my interests to fit his. It isn't about showing him things it's about spending time with him and teaching him through your actions to be a good person. They are always watching and learning from you. Remember that when you are in a situation where your son is present. Great job for trying to be the best dad you can.
What is your favourite (or standout) memory from a romantic relationship (current or ex)? What does it feel like to remember it?	I flew to Portugal. The hostel was so run down I couldn't find it and had to ask the locals. When a handsome host opened the door, I felt like hit by lightning, immediate butterflies in my stomach. I checked in, wrapped a blanket around my shoulders because it was cold, and the host took me up the stairs to show me my room. In the middle of the stairs my blanket slipped. The host picked it up, came so close to my mouth that it felt like he was about to kiss me in a second, wrapped the blanket around my shoulders and proceeded to move up the stairs. Not sure if I have ever been more turned on than in that moment. You could feel all the unreleased sexual tension.	When he proposed. We went to the Philippines for our 5 year anniversary, while we were having dinner (at sunset on the beach) we were supposed to swap gifts - we put a price limit of like £20 because, ya know, we went the freaking Philippines as “the gift” - and he proposed. And I bought him a fucking T-shirt. So anticlimactic.
Hopeless romantics: what stranger do you see regularly and have a secret crush on?	I don't generally crush on strangers just in case I see them on the news or in the paper for something abhorrent. Saves me the heartache.	There's a guy at my climbing gym who I see around and refer to in my head as my boyfriend, e.g. "Oh look my boyfriend's here." I'm currently trying to seduce him by walking past him all the time but not making eye contact.
Redditors who married someone of a different religion: What kind of wedding did you have and why?	Husband is no longer Catholic but there was some pressure to have a Catholic wedding. I was raised Pagan. We had a nondenominational wedding in front of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign! Fun wedding.	Went to a Hindu/Jewish wedding the other day - it was quite a nice blend of the two cultures. The bride (Hindu) wore a sari and a Star of David necklace and the groom (Jewish) wore a kurta and a yarmulke. Apparently getting married under a canopy is present in both cultures, so there was that. Then they exchanged garlands and walked around a sacred fire as per Hindu custom. Then there was an exchange of rings which I believe is part of neither culture per se but more of a secular thing now. Then the groom got to break a glass as per Jewish culture. It was a really nice ceremony, actually!
There seems to be a big societal push for more women in STEM fields. Why isn't there a similar push for men in education &amp; health fields?	Men are already in health fields. The reason for men being shut out of female-heavy jobs is that the women don't want men competing for their jobs. They want their jobs, and they want our jobs.	Because there's this myth, still, that women are under-represented in education. Even though women hold more college AND graduate degrees, graduate AND are enrolled in college at higher rates, have entire departments dedicated to studying their (our?) gender, and a myriad of other things, higher education has a hard-on for women (bonus points for being a 'woman of color,' in my hispanic-lady-experience). If a woman goes into STEM, she faced adversity to do so, so the mindset goes. If a man does the same in an education/ administrative one, there is no such belief, IME. Women receive more gender-based scholarships and have more out-of-classroom support, yet are *still* thought to be systemically oppressed and face all kinds of 'barriers' in education.
Bisexual ladies – does it bug you when a male partner sees bisexuality as a turn on?	If you found a bi guy hot would you not saying that to him because it might invalidate their social identity?	If it was an obsession that would bother me. If they found it hot I wouldn't be especially bothered.... I find it hot if my partner is bi, so...
Fellow small-chested women, what are some tips for going braless during summer?	I don't go braless despite being 32A. Deflated tits are never cute. I would suggest maybe getting little nipple cover thingies? They are flesh colored and just go over the nipple.	I use these [Nippies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PU9A9Q) - they're adhesive and reusable. I have several summer dresses that are incompatible with bras, so that's when I use them most - I've had my pair since 2014. They conceal both color and headlights.
What the actual fuck is wrong with my boyfriend?	What the fuck is wrong with your BF! Seriously. Probably he was depressed as shit, but, if my GF comes with me in my bday with a gift (no matter what) wrapped in underwear, wishing me a happy bday, the least I do (no matter how shitty about my self feels), it is to hug and kiss her and say thanks to her. I mean, his behavior sucked.	This isn't too different from the woman who asked why her boyfriend became distant after he lost his job. Truth is, we internalise our feelings (well some of us) and when our pride and self-esteem as been fucked with we go into a cave and we don't come out until we want to ourselves. I don't see how giving him a games console when he's stressed about feeling unemployed is gonna do anything but make him feel worse. How is he supposed to enjoy such a present while he's out trying to find employment. while its true he is wrong for smashing the present, and I understand your intentions were good, you failed to take his first warnings and pushed him into an emotional response. The games console is a nice present, but it could have waited for a better time.
You rescue a sneaky genie from a bottle. How do you word your wish so it won't come back to bite you?	I'd say "I wish that you would be free" and that's all. I don't trust a genie to give me anything without screwing me over so I might as well free the bastard and make a friend	It might be worth my time to hire a lawyer for this one. I don't trust myself to word it as perfectly as it probably needs to be.
What's the difference between an experienced and an inexperienced woman in bed?	Surprisingly not much. I've fucked virgins and sluts. What really matters is how lazy/entitled the girl is. I've had sluts that will just lay there and take it and just moan and beg for it harder/faster without moving, and virgins that scratch my back, drive their hips down into it, and do everything in their power to make it apparent that they're LOVING it and want more.	when something awkward happens, if she laughs it off and doesn't make a big deal about it, she's good to go
who is the dumbest person you've ever dated?	My roommate dated a girl who came to the apartment one time to watch a movie. She was perusing my DVD collection for something to watch. And after about four minutes of silent looking, she says, "Oh, they're in alphabetical order." It took a lot to stifle a condescending comment.	I dated a guy who told me tapioca and rice were the same thing (like tapioca pudding was just another name for rice pudding). I don't think it's a big deal making a mistake like that, people make silly mistakes, but when I told him that wasn't accurate, he got really mad at me and kept insisting and saying that he knew more about food than I did (he wanted to be a chef). So later I looked it up and he got really, really mad and said, "You always have to be right, don't you?!" No. I just ... was right.
What is a red flag in regards to dating a woman?	If her Facebook info says "Likes Men". Often times, it's normal for someone to not explicitly admit that they're queer on social media, because they might not be out at work, or some other social group that you'll never meet. But if it says "Likes Men", she is clearly closeted to some group of people close enough to her that you will have to pretend to be a "Gal Pal" at some point.	- talks about exes often - super clingy - wants to search through your computer/phone and feels entitled to - She drops all her friends as soon as she is dating you - enjoys ultimatums - guilt trips hardcore - always wants to go out with you your friends - she thinks being "crazy" is a good thing and waves that flag proud - expects that a "man takes care of her" in life. These are red flags that can pertain to men or women though, just swap a few words around. lol
If you're a woman making $100,000+/year, what's life like?	Happy, but I'm a generally happy person who gets what she wants (by working hard and being tough, not by being annoying). I'm not sure if you're thinking the $100k makes a person a certain way...I think I am a certain way and that's why I make more than $100k. Do what you love and don't worry about the money. You could not pay me $1 million to do something I hate for 40+ years of life. EDIT: wow, leave it to Reddit to turn totally inspiring intentions into me being an asshole because I'm not thinking of all the poor people who are struggling and would do anything for money. Oh well, that's your choice.	I love it, but I'm still not used to it. I had my daughter when I was 17 and never ever expected to NOT struggle financially. I grew up on food stamps and donations from the church, so not stressing about how to afford groceries is a huge shift. I don't know if I'll ever get used to it.
Morning ladies! What's something you do that might sound "crazy" if you said it out loud, but seems totally rational to you?	I like to bring tea or coffee into the bathroom when I poop. I'll sit there and drink the warmth in. I am convinced it helps me a little when I am constipated because coffee and tea relax me while I drink them.	I spend a lot of time planning hypothetical scenarios, like arguments, people randomly attacking, etc. It keeps me occupied in the shower or if I am in public and I'm bored. Of course, I am a pretty paranoid person, so this may genuinely be crazy, but it has come in handy from time to time
Fellow ladies, can we talk about this men-must-be-confident thing?	Fun fact: self-deprecating humor is the most attractive type of humor. It shows that you're comfortable enough in your own skin that even you can make fun of you.	I'm an introverted female. Alpha guys were like a blowtorch to my candle. I got with another introvert and we lived happily ever after. We would never have found each other in a bar or a club. I think the way we look for partners in screwed up. We've set up a system where the alpha men and women have a great time partying and finding each other and the rest of us are left feeling like lonely failures. Get out of the bars and live your life doing what you enjoy. Look around at the others doing the same thing. They are your best dating prospects.
Guys who thought with their dick and it backfired - what happened?	Slept with my ex once. She proceeded to text me all the time for a couple weeks. Ghosted the fuck out of her.	The hot girl im my group of friends called me one night saying she needed a place to crash i being single and hoping to bang her said ok. 20 minutes after she arrived her crazy ex pulled up with a baseball bat. It went about how you would expect. I pulled my gun he dropped the bat and ran abandoning his car neighbors called the cops before I could. They pulled up as I was dialing 911. She told them I pulled a gun on him for no reason luckily i had set up cctv cameras the year before. I showed the cops the tape they asked if i wanted him charged which i declined. I threw her out of the house and lost a group of friends.
How would you react if your SO hit you? Would you leave?	I have never hit a woman but I would slap the hell out of bitch if she hit me first. If you act like a man I will treat you like one. I've made this crystal clear in every long term relationship I've been in and there has never been any physical abuse. My advice to anyone would be to set clear boundaries and never cross them. If you allow someone to hit you or abuse you in any way they are going to take advantage of it.	It depends. If we have many years of good history together, she's normally a non-violent person, and this is the first time? I'd first want to understand what happened, why now, and what's wrong. In other words, if it's an extreme anomaly and out of character, I want understanding. If it's a relatively new relationship, or she's shown aggressive/controlling behavior before? We're done. Instantly. I won't say a word, just exit, and worry about recovering my things later.
What well-intentioned thing has gone wrong for you?	I bought my friend froyo and put mango on it because I thought Asians love mango...and it turned out he was allergic to it. He plucked the chunks off and ate it anyway, but he thought my reasoning was hilarious.	i offered someone a bag for their dog's poop because the dog pooped and the person started walking away, and she completely flipped out on me and called me a nosy c-word and some other things. how was i supposed to know she was just a lazy POS and left the house without a bag on purpose?
What is something you were told "you'll change your mind" about and you eventually did? What about things you'll never change your mind about despite being assured that you will?	Salads and onions. I can tolerate them now because I forced myself to. I'll never change my mind about having kids. I get *strong* feelings of disgust when I'm anywhere near kids. People shouldn't be encouraging people to have kids when they hate them! Getting sterilized in the next few years. Oh, and a (now former) coworker told me I'd change my mind about Trump because I'm smart. 😂😂😂	I changed my mind about working in an office. I used to swear up and down that I'd never work a boring, lame, stuffy cubicle job because that would be *selling out,* man! Uh, yeah. Give me a steady schedule, benefits and contribute to my retirement any day of the week! I don't think I will change my mind about not wanting kids, though.
Men who were thrown back into the dating pool with zero tinder/online dating experience: how's it going?	Stop trying to "get" women. Not worth it. Save your time and money. Spend your time doing things you like and spending your money on yourself. If you want sex, hire a prostitute or take a "Sexcation". As someone who raised a family (including step-children), I consider my last 30 years of life wasted and if I could have it back, I wouldn't do it again. Have a "relationship" is just a sounds-nice way of women getting men to "provide" for them while giving little to nothing of value in return. Skip it!	I spent like 6 months tindering. This is what I learned. Super likes have a MUCH higher success rate, I would swipe until I deemed someone super like worthy then stop swiping. If you drop your standards a bit you'll have more success. Obvious but true. A match doesn't actually mean shit. Understandable considering going on a date with someone you just met on a dating app is totally different to swiping right. For every 1000 guys like you on Tinder there's 1 girl. Good luck with that. Tinder will take your self esteem into the alley outside and shoot it. Tinder is a waste of time.
What do you think is behind redditors' obsession with 'rational' and 'logical' discussion, and the dismissal of emotions even when they are appropriate?	I think that it's an example of white/male privilege to be able to insist that someone be unemotional about things like sexism and racism. If it doesn't effect your life, it's much easier to keep emotional distance, but that doesn't make you better at deciding about it. Privileged people tend to think it does, though, until it's something that does effect them and does give them emotions, then they realize that first hand experience can be important for forming an opinion. I also think men tend to put anger in some other category besides emotions. Being angry is normal, being sad or scared is emotional.	Two fold. One because I've noticed emotions is often used to describe only specific ones. Anger is somehow excluded despite it being a very strong emotion. Two is I'm guessing based on how they've learned to debate and discuss. The way I was taught was that if you lose your cool, if you show your emotional investment in a topic, you lose on the basis that it's no longer a discussion of the idea alone, but the idea filtered through your feelings on it. That's still a valid discussion, but it is a very different one. It's the difference between discussing a topic when both parties have no skin in the game and discussion a topic that is near and dear to both parties.
What physical imperfections do men get away with that women don’t on average?	I don't know why it was so hard for anyone to stay on topic for this one, but it's been a mess to clean up.	I don't know why it was so hard for anyone to stay on topic for this one, but it's been a mess to clean up.
Is it safe to say all guys look at naked girls online, like insta and reddit?	There was a study that attempted to find how porn effected men's views of the opposite sex. In the study they attempted to find just 50 men who never watched porn. They couldn't find 50 and gave up on the study. So keep that in mind, all men view it. However, it's not an emotional thing for us. Some men just look at naked women the same way they look at pictures of new Ferrari's. You admire the beauty of it, but you know that driving that car is a huge pain the ass and all around not enjoyable of a car to have at all and you'd much prefer your 3 year old Honda. However it doesn't mean it's not nice to look at. Porn star and attractive women are like the Ferrari, great to look at but almost always a pain in the ass to be around.	I'd say it's typically a bad idea to over-generalize, but I'd say it's safe to say the majority of straight men in the western world look at porn/erotica of some sort. I think your desire for a little discretion is reasonable. Let him look at porn, but show him how to open an incognito browser window. I think hoping for a guy who only jerks off to images in his head may be a little fantastic. Porn is just too easy to access to expect someone not to access it.
What do you think about being a 'provider'?	If you are planning to have kids, your future wife is going to go on maternity leave and someone is going to need to pay the bills while they are out. And yes... 9/10, you, as the man, will the leader in the relationship. It is your role. Step up.	I would never be with someone that needed me to provide for them. It doesn't sound like you want that either so just keep dating man.
Men who have had PIV: can I ask you this incredibly gross question?	I don't think that's what you're feeling. But even if it is, no, I've never noticed this in a decade plus of regular sex.	I have never noticed it. The penis, while, of course, sensitive, is not nearly as sensitive as fingers. The only times I have felt a turd in a girl has been when sticking fingers up her butthole.
Men, how does it feel to have your desires and needs ignored?	It's not any different from any other day. Women are people, men are resources. Men who are bad at being resources get attacked/discredited/shamed/belittled. Men who are good at being resources get **tolerated**. For now.	If it isn't working you say goodbye and find someone more compatible. It's nobody's job to do things they don't want to do. Wouldn't want to be with someone who isn't absolutly thrilled to 'fulfill my desires'.
People who grew up in a "bad neighborhood. How aware were you as a child that you lived in a bad neighborhood?	I was aware that we lived in a bad neighborhood when a guy died right in front of our house and the cops came by to knock on the door to ask if we had seen anything. We weren't home at the time that he died, but I was about 8 or 9 when this happened.	Undercover cops were parked in front of my house a lot for years until my neighbors were finally arrested. I wasn’t allowed down the street alone, ever. My older brother walked me places with a bat or golf club. My neighborhood had a curfew. I was a little aware, but not really. Not until friends from school started to come over and comment.
What are some fun "date night in" ideas?	I took my boyfriend on a sunset picnic the other day. Packed us fruit, cheese, pretzels, sandwiches and juice. Went to the dollar store and picked up plastic plates, utensils, a candle and a plastic table cloth. I then googled parks and searched for reviews on the best sunset views in my area. Found the perfect place and had a perfect evening :)	- Fondu - "Paint Nite" .. Buy supplies and follow along an instructional video (or Bob Ross, which is always amusing). You can get inexpensive supplies from the dollar store or on sale at Michaels - light some candles and do oil massages - really bad B movie night with some drinks and lots of snacks - multiplayer video games and pizza

Women who have witnessed their ideas being passed over and later witnessing a man presents the same idea, and then people listen... How did you handle it?	This happened to me when I was 10 so I kicked him in the dick later during P.E. I got in trouble for it and I didn't tell why I did it because my principal and P.E. teacher were assholes so I just accepted the punishment from them and moved on. I did tell my parents the reason though. My mom was proud but my Dad told me to find a better solution next time. Nowadays, I just don't present my ideas because if they get stolen, when I accuse the stealer everyone turns against me and blames me saying I'm the one who stole my own ideas. So, yeah that's how I do it I guess.	Get better at documenting every. Single. Thing. I. Do. CYA = cover your ass. It doesn't apply to just not getting blamed for mistakes. It also helps to prove your contributions.

Ladies in a long distance relationship, how do you do it?	The only thing keeping a long dist relationship together is the desperation level of the partners. If they can't find anyone else.. they might as well "pretend" they have a SO in another country to save themselves social embarrassment	Reading some of these comments, I feel silly for worrying at all about being 2.5hr away for 4 months. Keep strong people!
Ladies with sisters, how did you deal with being labeled as “the pretty one”, “the smart one”, etc.? How did this affect your relationship with your sibling?	I don't know what our given labels were, but we were both smart. In our teens I was the one in a committed relationship, didn't go to parties to drink or smoke. My sister was the opposite. She went through a somewhat "rebellious" period and it did split us up for some time. We had a lot of arguments and we were apart for a few years when I moved away after high school that helped us work past the differences.	I was the 'pretty' one until my sister survived puberty. In one summer she shot straight up, and she evened out all over and was suddenly \*stunning\*. She looks like a model and now i'm just the 'cute and funny' one. Fine by me. You people were paying too much attention to me anyway.
Women of AskMen, has browsing this sub changed any of your views?	Yeah, I really liked being friends with men but I didn't realize just how much vitriol there was towards the female gender. Now I'm much more hesitant about these things.	Yes. Well maybe not changed views but it's nice to learn some things. Even if they are sad things, like how scared men are of being nice or chatty with an unknown child, even if it's at a playground, for fear of being seen as a predator. I'm sorry that happens.
Women who spray toilet seats with pee -- WHY?	In public bathroom I don't sit, I squat and pee. Sometimes it sprays on the toilet seat. Usually I wipe it with toilet paper. Sometimes I am lazy and don't do it. :/	I see this question asked somewhat regularly. You're never going to get an answer. The type of person who leaves a giant mess in a public bathroom is not the type of person who enjoys answering introspective questions.
What "worst case scenario" actually happened when you went up and talked to someone?	Not my worst case scenario, but *her* worst case scenario. She tried to get my attention from behind unexpectedly, I turned suddenly and essentially punched her in the tits. This time it was accidental. She's a total bitch so I didn't really feel bad about it. I 'accidentally' punched her in the tits on at least two other occasions.	Several years ago I was at a bar with a small dance floor. I was really trashed, and finally some rock comes on. I go up on the dance floor and start air guitaring my heart out. Then this cute punk chick comes and starts dancing with me and offering me some of her beer. I take a swig, and hand it back. I was feeling great. And then her less attractive frumpy friend comes up, pulls her aside and loudly says "Ewwwww what are you doing, dancing with the fat ape?!" and proceeded to pull her friend away. That deflated my ego somewhat, although I still danced with her friend. Another time when I was like a freshman in college, I asked a girl to dance at home coming or some such dance and she shook her head and said "ughhh nope! Next!"

Men of Reddit, what’s the creepiest thing a girl has done to you?	Some weird girl in high school had an obsessive crush on me since day one just because I talked to her once. She first started by telling a bunch of people and I had a lot of girls coming up to me trying to pressure me into asking her out. She also had her creepy friends keep reminding me that she liked me and that I should give her a chance. She got one of my close female friends (who was sort of friends with her at the time) to pass the message, but since I was more comfortable talking to my friend I told her to tell her I wasn’t interested. She got a case of sour grapes then spent the rest of high school harassing me and getting her weird friends to harass me as well.	Wearing a kilt. She decided to just check what was going on beneath it. No foreplay, just.. hey what do you have going on there, * reach *.
This might be the stupidest question on this sub but... I [M29] just started dating my first girlfriend. What do I need to know about menstruation?	Not if but when she is mean to you for no good reason for the love of goodness don't get mad back. 1; that's unfair because she can't control how she feels. And 2; it will only make things worse. Plus she'll probably apologize at some point if she's a decent girl. Also, my girlfriend is a salty food person but every time she goes berserk for chocolate, so buy lots of tampons and lots of chocolate and try to understand she's probably in more pain than you've experienced all month and her hormones are so out of whack she doesn't know left from down or backwards from diagonal. Hope this helps.	Do offer a little sympathy if a woman complains; don't go into crazy overprotective mode. We've dealt with this every month since our teens: if there was a way for you to magically fix things, we would have asked for it by now. 'Let me know if there's anything you want or need' is a good thing to say. Sometimes a foot rub or hot water bottle is nice, but honestly the only way for you to know when that might be is if we tell you. Women have different levels of comfort for talking about menstruation, but a matter-of-fact, chilled attitude from a guy is rarely offensive. (Oh, and if you're ever asked to fetch a clean pair of knickers for a woman on the loo, please select comfy, sturdy ones, not wispy lacy ones.)
What's something women tend to be insecure about but you find hot?	Lots of prior partners. If I meet a girl and she admits that she’s lost count of how many people she’s slept with but ballparks it at “I dunno, a couple hundred?”, I’m ready to move in together and get a join checking account.	Tall girls almost always wish they were shorter. If I’m attracted, I only see it as a plus. There’s more of her to wrap around me.
Askmen, what is your favorite sex position and why?	The whole idea of sex positions turns me off. Sometimes I fuck her from the front, sometimes from behind. But if your idea of spicing things up in bed is to put your foot behind my head, then you are terrible at sex.	Seated cross legged with her legs around my waist. Super intimate, you're right up against each other. She gets hers easily, and all I have to do to get mine is put my hands back, lean, and start thrusting away Edit: typo
What things confuse you the most about men?	This is more a subset of men than all men, but WTF is up with PUAs? In what universe does it make sense to stereotype all women as "girls like when you do this" and treating us like we're all this monolithic separate species that dispenses sex like a vending machine, further alienate us by reducing us to numbers on a "Hot Babe" scale of 1-10, violate our boundaries through trying anything to get "kino" and ignoring our clear "NO" by calling it "Last-minute resistance" that you just need to coerce us through--and then asking OTHER MEN WHAT WOMEN LIKE?	At least for the men I know in college, a lot of the self-worth is tied up into their ability to have a girlfriend. Not GPA, career prospects, number of friends, wealth, fitness, etc. Girlfriend.
I misunderstood a girl and thought she wanted to have sex with me so I did. Later I found out she wanted something else but was turned on by my spontaneity. How do you feel about spontaneous sex with a friend? What are some examples where this has happened to you?	Anyone else feel like OP is bragging? I mean, congrats OP, but I don't understand the question here. Is spontaneous sex awesome? YES	Any time I've had sex with a friend, it wasn't like *discussed* before hand. Usually there's just a vibe and someone makes a move.
What's the absolute worst piece of advice you've ever listened to, and what was the result of doing it?	"Look, walking can't hurt and pregnancy is no excuse to gain weight because you're already fat." As it was I was so sick I had lost weight, and it turns out walking can indeed hurt. Not only did I have high blood pressure, I had mild pelvic dysplasia and SEVEN FUCKING YEARS LATER my pelvis, hips, and lower back will all slip and twist because of the damage done by 'just go for a walk' being said to me every time I ever talked to anyone about anything (tired? Walk more! Sad? Walk more! Feel sick? Walk it off!).	Not me but somebody told my friend that cooking oil works better than sunscreen Cue massive blisters and completely burned
What are some of your female life pro tips?	Please, please, please, wrap up any sanitary item that you are going to throw in the trash. At my work we have several young college girls and I left a discreet note by the trash can asking them to do this. Nobody wants to look at a bloody item. *shudder*	Stand up straight and walk with authority everywhere you go. It makes you feel like Wonder Woman and people will ask you for directions even if you have no idea where you are.
Women that were friends with their SO before getting together: What did your friendship look like? How did you make the transition?	I don't understand the premise of the question. How could you get into a romantic relationship _without_ being friends first?	Lots of hanging out and talking, getting to know each other on a good level. Eventually, we slowly started going to dinner together and then going out to do things together. We got stuck in that period for a little while. It was like we were dating but there was no physical aspect to our relationship. I knew I liked him pretty soon after we started going out, but wasn't sure about his feelings for me. One day, I had him over to watch movies and hang out. I fell asleep with my head on his shoulder, woke up with his arms around me, and the rest is history. Each phase always felt very natural and I think it evolved well.
What are you sick of seeing in guy's profiles on tinder?	Dudes on Tinder period. I have it set to only show women, why the fuck doesn't the filter work dammit?	"just ask" "i'm not good at writing bios" "don't swipe me if you're going to want to talk forever" & I second the annoying negativity, bitterness, dead animal photos, and the "8'2" because apparently that matters" Also apparently 50% of tinder has been to Machu Picchu
DAE have a love affair with 3/4 length sleeves?	I need to wear more things with 3/4 sleeves. I'm always wearing long sleeve sweaters and inevitably end up with the sleeves pushed up my arms. I don't know how it happens, but apparently, my arms hate sleeves even when I'm freezing.	I'm 6' with a 6'3" wingspan. They're not my favorite, but I forced a liking for them because they look intentional and long sleeves NEVER are long enough, like ever.
What is your favorite "I like my ____ like I like my ___ " statement?	I can't believe this needs to be said (well maybe I can), but posts that make light of any kind of violence will be removed per our rules. Please report them. Thanks.

What is something really insignificant to a bystander but can really fuck up your day?	Driving past bikers. They're on their way to working out their legs, while obscuring the road and increasing the chances of an accident.	A few days after shaving your junk and you get that "itchy phase" where if your junk isn't perfectly placed, it'll be the most uncomfortable thing all day. Constantly rearranging.
What is the most memorable, in a good way random encounter you have had with a stranger who you haven't encountered since then?	I was in a new town (eventually moved here) walking down the street and this guy was running the other direction (like working out) and said he liked my necklace. I smiled and continued my walk towards this business, and as I get there the guy shows back up! All out of breath, he asked me out to coffee or drinks. I had a boyfriend at the time, and he was super respectful about me turning him down. I just thought like, wow, this stuff isn't supposed to happen in real life!	At universal studios years ago. Was dragged by my parents on a tour group filled with old people. I was the only person under 40. Sitting on the tram waiting for the tour to start there were people all dressed up as characters from movies. I was miserable and must of looked it. Frankenstein came up and shook my dads hand, growled at my mom and looked at me. Then he walked away to the hill beside the tram. He came back a few moments later with a tiny bouquet of windflowers. He bowed in front of me and handed it over. I didn't stop grinning for the rest of the day. Frankenstein made my 13 year old heart stutter :)
Guys who have been proposed to: How did you react? Did you know it was gonna happen?	I laughed at him and said if he felt like he could propose to me he didn't know me well enough. Edit: If you are confused I am a dude.	I was thinking about proposing to my girlfriend at the end of our month-long trip to Thailand. One night in the middle of the vacation while we are boning, she looks me in the eye and says "Will you marry me?" I go "Did you just ask me that?" She says "Please?" with puppy dog eyes. I say yes and we finish boning. It was such a surprise, but a very welcome one. It made me so damn happy and honestly took an insane amount of pressure off me. We also like telling people that she proposed.
Ladies who aren't on birth control: are you going to get an IUD after last night's results?	No, I'm still relying on condoms. They've worked just fine so far. I don't expect the pill or IUD will become illegal even with Trump in office.	I was planning on waiting a few years to get a tubal and just using an IUD. Now I'm going to make that happen next year. Actually, I might call my doctor tomorrow and schedule an appointment to talk about it.
Guys who are with a woman who comes from a wealthier background, how has it impacted your relationship?	I love it. Am British with a posh accent from a family that was once wealthy and poor now. Marrying my wife was essentially getting our house bought for us, now approx £500000+ and never having to worry about the bumps in life.	Dated quite a few rich girls. One thing that has always struck me is that the family relationship is way different. Their dads are almost always these overworked heroes that they worship. Which, coming from a lower middle class background, I'll never understand. I've dated a few that wanted me to be like their dads, and a few that were glad I'm the opposite. The other thing is that the money never really matters, but it does. They've had way more opportunities and can always walk away from obligations if they want to. The price for this is that there are usually stings attached to the family money and most of them hate but accept. So it changes the dynamic because you have to be cool with the conditions that come with the money. If you aren't, changing that dynamic is next to impossible.
How many of you won't identify as a feminist despite broadly agreeing with its ideals?	I don't identify as a feminist because first and foremost I am a Christian. Any other -ist or -ism is less important to me in my book. I believe that Jesus gave an example of treating women equally, an example that was very radical for his day. If we truly follow Jesus (not men who use Christianity as a political tool) then feminism/equality will be the natural byproduct. I have also been told on more than one occassion that I "can't" be a feminist due to being pro-life/anti-abortion/whatever.	The main thing I dislike about the word is that everyone has a different definition, there is no consistency. I don't like using it because I have no idea what the other person thinks when they hear it.
AW, has an ex ever reached out to you years later? How did it go? What is your relationship like currently?	My ex reached out to me and we've been back together going on 7 years and 3years marriage. We've been off and on for about 19 years but still going strong and in love 😍. Marriage, relationships are hard you have every type of everything coming y'all's way especially when it's strong 💪🏼. Sometimes I feel like wow 😳 really, and then I feel like yes we're going to be alright. It's a lot of patience and dedication and the main thing loyalty. We couldn't of done it without our grand creator God ☺️	It was an amicable breakup and we now email catch up every few months, but I haven't seen him since. We invested a lot of time in one another so it's nice to learn how the other is turning out. We dated about 8 years ago and he reached out around the 5 year mark. I once reached out though, in a moment of guilt and stress, to an ex in attempt to apologize for everything that happened (at that time 4yrs in the past.). Was blocked instantly, 100% deserved.
Just found out my wife is pregnant, now what?	Paternity test. If it is yours, say goodbye to all your hopes and dreams. Don't worry, you will rationalize it as the best thing that ever happened to you. You will be too busy to see how much happier your childless and single friends are, so you never have any reason to question it.	Hey op, I’m not married or have a kid but thinking linearly here’s what I recommend: 1. Check your insurance and gets to see who fits where and what’ll be better to be under to give birth; also check ups and that coverage 2. Schedule appointments/check ups 3. Ask for materials at these checkups on how to prepare Edit: thanks u/silent_boy for this, but for 1., make sure the doctors that see your baby are in your network and not just the hospital; u/Ghostinthesky has a good point on free ultrasounds and recommends checking for some local services to begin this process of searching for care and knowledge on raising kids!
Moms of AW, what was the strictest punishment you've ever given your kid &amp; what did they do to deserve it?	Not a mom, but my strictest punishment was having my books taken away and not being allowed to go to the library before my brother's Saturday baseball games. It was usually for bad grades.	My four year old went through a phase where he would bite his older brother when he got mad. The usual tactics weren't working so I told him the next time he bit someone that I would bite him. Sure enough, he bites his brother the next day. So I took his little arm in my hands and brought it up to my mouth -he's crying, apologizing, begging me not to do it, but following through on what I tell my kids is important to me - so I bit him. Not hard enough to bruise him or break the skin, but it left a mark for about half an hour. And he hasn't bit anyone since! It was kind of surreal and I hated doing it, but it worked. A little empathy goes a long way!
Single Men: How fast do you catch feelings?	With all the drama I went trough regarding women and it not even being my own fault either, I really have a hard time trusting women to start with. So in my case she really will need to try hard to even get any further then simply 'noticing' her. I would like to trust a woman, but so far no woman got near any level of trust that was needed to win me over. All thanks to some rotten apples that thought it would be excellent to ruin my life and figure out later that they made a horrible mistake. And yes, I did have a lot return to me begging me to take them in my life after what they did to me.	I’ve been speaking to a girl for 2 weeks, gone on one date. Already planning our marriage lol what’s wrong with me. Caught feelings pretty bad
Currently at this moment on a nightmare first date. How'd you mess up on online dating?	Just to point out to all the girls relating all of their horrifying first-date experiences I promise we don't all suck. Just the majority	I talked to a man, online and on the phone, for about three weeks. I was interested and he appeared handsome in his pictures. We set a first date for the upcoming weekend. He got into town Thursday night and talks me in to meeting him for an impromptu dinner. He shows up - with his 6 year old daughter in tow. Ten minutes into the date the little girl 'whispers' in her dads' ear "Daddy, I don't like her. I like Jennifer better".
Have you given or received more oral sex in your life?	Received. I don't do blowjobs but my boyfriend knows if he wants sex he needs to go down on me first.	Given. I'm going to go out on a limb and say >80% of the women in this question will answer given.
My girlfriend is going to prison. How do i support her while she is there and what will happen to her?	[Hmmmm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/7h4tka/what_would_you_do_if_your_so_went_to_prison_and/) In any case, assuming against all odds that this thread is genuine: If you want to support her, then above all you need to be a lifeline to her. That'll keep her head straight while in the slammer and drastically increase her chances of rehabilitation once she gets out. That means visiting her regularly, giving her something to look forward to, someone who's not an inmate to talk to, and so on and so forth.	I know this isn’t the answer you’re probably looking for but I’d cut my losses and walk away in a hurry. The mentality that it’s okay to steal shit because you can’t afford it is alarming. I couldn’t trust having someone like that around or even in my house.
What are some negative traits you have but secretly like?	I'm extremely negative and introverted. I actually really like this about myself. I am able see what a lot of people refuse to see or acknowledge. I can see things for how they really are. I like I am a quiet observer and no one pesters me or expects anything of me.	I'm apparently a bit scary and standoffish which sucks when it comes to meeting new friends but is the best thing ever for teaching rowdy teenagers. I once silenced a dining hall full of kids by drawing myself up to my full height and looking at them.
What is a trait you struggle to find in a man?	Most of these answers so far, seem to be personality based, which can be fixed or amended with proper company. The one trait that I see slip by many men, that is the most sexy, attractive, and the all around best trait is: **confidence**. A man who lacks confidence is one to be ignored; a man with great confidence is one to be noticed, despite intelligence, stature, or any other physical or mental trait. If you have confidence in what you are doing, you will succeed.	Genuine interest. Relationships always start great, but I find that after a while, he'll get too comfortable and think he can stop treating me nicely and I'll still stick around. General apathy is usually what I experience.
Girls on tinder, what do you look for in a guy's bio?	When listing hobbies, please list actual hobbies. No "chilling" or "gym" in fact "gym life" is an automatic pass from me. If you do work out, tell me specifics like "Oh I run marathons, or I fucking love MMA." If you just casually go to the gym, it isn't a super huge part of your life, don't include it to impress someone.	Im a dude in a wheelchair and i have "i love long walks on the beach, except i cant walk and i get stuck in the sand" Girls love something funny about yourself
What is a mistake you see dads make with their daughters that you think they overlook?	One thing my dad did was he would try to make good points but frame them like jokes. Like when I was a teen (and I thought I was super cool) I tried wearing a lot of black, and he'd say "you going to a funeral?" Or I'd wear something tight and he'd tell me to "stop stealing clothes from six year olds." When I wore too much makeup on my eyes he'd ask "who punched you?" When I was being an angsty teen that of course just made me mad, but now I realize he just didn't want me dressing like such a little punk.	Not everything has to be a life lesson. I literally got a lecture this weekend about keeping your head cool in a crisis because I had to borrow a torque screwdriver to repair my oven after it caught a greasefire from a leaky springform pan. Mind you, I dumped a bag of flour on it, put it out, and then set out to disassembling and cleaning once it cooled, but I still got a "It's important to remember where your head is at" for about two hours. I just wanted a screwdriver head that I didn't own.
When did you realise Reddit wasn't the place you wanted to be getting life advice from?	The moment I discovered how popular the belief that it really doesn't matter if your future wife was the town bike is on here.	once you start making your own actual experiences, it's pretty easy to realize that reddit is a super mixed bag. people love to give their opinions. few opinions are worthy of taking seriously. also, we're individuals and our individual situations have a million details that make them unique. there's usually no really easy and universal answers to really hard questions. I use reddit to get some impulses or stimuli, to see whether I might have forgotten to try to see something from a certain perspective. I also "met" some cool and helpful people.
What desperate attempts had a person tried to get you to date them?	A guy once asked me if I was a psycho bitch because I wasn't giving him enough attention, and then told me he really liked me. Yeah, ok, see ya, buddy.	A girl shoved two twinkies into her mouth to get my number. It was funny so we went on one date, it didn't work out after that.
What is the one thing you wish your SO had never asked you?	I'm not a woman but I think the question of "how many" and "who have you" slept with should never be said. As a dude I never ask these questions. It's none of my business and I think it's personal.	What my password to my computer was. If I gave it to him I would lose my privacy. If I didn't give it to him then he would think I don't trust him. I trusted him enough to give it to him. Well, I ended up losing my privacy when he went snooping around my computer and he still lost my trust.
What's the best part of living alone?	My boyfriend and I live together and constantly leave funny shapes in the hair on our shower wall for the next person to discover 😂😅	I love going home after a busy day of work and not having to hear anyone else talk. To be able to hear myself think again, and not spend a second caring about what anyone around me wants from me, how to speak to someone, how anyone else is feeling but myself. If I want to sing and dance I can, if I want to huddle in a corner and decompress about the day I can. I don't have to try to tell anyone to leave me alone in a way that won't hurt their feelings, listen to their gossip or judgment, meet their friends, feel any way about how the chores are balanced or who's taking up how much space. If I sound like I hate people, I just might.
What's the best thing that has happened to you ever and why?	Having my kids. They are the joy of my life. I wasn't sure I wanted kids. Now I'm happy in a way I never even thought was possible.	Going to college. In High School I had shit social skills, never got invited to parties, friends would regularly hang out with each other and "forget" to invite me, that sort of thing. After a month of college I was a campus celebrity. Turns out that when I am invited to parties, I'm the life of the party. I was respected by my professors, admired by my peers, I even got to start a pretty sweet band. It wasn't perfect, I still had a lot of personal issues, but the change was like night and day. I remember going back home and hearing someone I used to know comment on how I used to be all "violin and videogames". Nah dude, you just never gave me a chance to be anything else.
For those that prefer thin girls, what is it that you like?	Thin girls to me are like 185 lbs lol. I'm sitting at a strong 220 lbs and a 185 lb girl is nothing to me.	I prefer small breasts, actually am turned off by big breasts, and thinner tend to have smaller breasts. I prefer smaller or at least tighter asses and bigger girls tend to have looser flabbier butts. Also long lean thin legs are better when wrapped around me
Did any men have limited dating experience before 25? How did your relationships work out after?	Im 26, had one girlfriend from 19-23, then a few meaningless one night stands, never fell in love again, became extremely jealous, possessive, paranóid. Fuck bitches man	I didn't really date much until I was like 28. I'm 34 now and got engaged last week, so I'd say it worked out fine.
What’s the best compliment to give a man who has suffered a recent lack of confidence?	It's been 2 weeks and you are not going to find any magical way to make it all better. Start with simple things. Let all the air out of one tire on your car and then use a drill to drive a rusty old screw into the tire (between the treads). Call him to come over and change the tire because you don't know what to do. It will make him feel needed, which is a starting point.	Keep being kind to him. She must have said some deeply devastating things to him. It may take some time for him to get passed it and to remember that *he* dumped *her*, obviously for good reason. And, does it really matter what the complement is? People say they like my nail color, I'm smiling the rest of the day.
Enough of all these stupid relationship posts- who is your favourite character on TV right now and why?	Daisy Johnson from Agents of SHIELD. She's badass, an Asian WOC, clever, funny, and following her through her hero's journey from Skye to Quake has been amazing and emotional. Blair Waldorf from Gossip Girl will always be one of my favorite characters of all time. She was a total boss with a heart of gold, gorgeous, amazing wardrobe, my tastes match hers almost identically, and her romance was amazing. Fiona Gallagher from Shameless because she shows the true strength and resilience of women. I just want to protect her from the world. (I'm only on season 4, no spoilers pls!)	Rosa from Brooklyn 99. I can't decide if I want to be her or marry her. She's take no shit awesome.
To those who sleep separately from your spouse/partner: why &amp; where do you sleep instead?	We sleep in our own separate beds, in separate houses, because neither of us have a job or a car yet and we live 10 miles apart at the moment.	Other bedroom. He's a heat generator and I have hot flashes. Opposite schedules. Special needs pets, need to be in the same room. I am a terrible sleeper who doesn't work outside the home so I'm the one who finds it easiest to keep the erratic hours.
Fathers of Reddit, what's your "how I met your mother" story?	She was on Tinder and I saw that she hated sex, her 3 children were her world, and that she needed a man in her life because the kids are her world. How could I not swipe right? How could I not swipe right after seeing the angles she used in those pictures!	I was being an asshole in a chat room on AOL in 94 and she called me on it. Been together ever since, now have 3 kids.
Men who have dated someone from a different country, what was the biggest difference?	I dated a Romanian girl. She prioritized truth over political correctness. The Romanian government is corrupt and everyone knows it. But not like how lunatic social justice warriors call the US government corrupt--these are people who haven't experienced society in different parts of the world; they haven't faced reality. Not saying there aren't bad things about the USG, as there surely are, but let's not get too insane here like social justice warriors do. She could actually point out the good things and bad things in people instead of "all x are bad and all x are good. If you disagree with me, fuck you". Instead, she was capable of holding a rational argument and accepting truths from all sides. What are we going to do with all these crazy social justice warriors?	I'm Irish. I've had long term relationships with German ×2, Polish and Lithuania girls. The Eastern European girls are more traditional and the Germans like slightly weird sex. Other than that not much else, oh naturally they are better looking than Irish women.
"Hot" guys: how often are you rejected? Is dating easy?	ITT: All the shallow implications of human beings the people who adhere to the social contract refuse to admit in public.	yes it's easy to date, i.e. finding someone that's physically attracted. But I'm still a piece of shit inside so being rejected, droped and flaked on is very common.
What food were you eating "wrong" for way too long? How did you realize what the "right" way was?	carbs, particularly "healthy" carbs like fruits or whole grain breads and what not. used to think it was healthy to just eat an acai bowl and loads of fruit or whole grain toast. but it has so much sugar and carbs even if we think it's just "fruit=healthy" sure it's natural, but it's not healthy to eat that much sugar. or most breakfasts, you think fruit, some yogurt maybe, some orange juice or oatmeal. if you count the carbs it's just so much sugar you might as well eat a slice of cake instead.	When I was a kid I would chew on the muffin paper when I was done. I don’t remember swallowing it - it was more like muffin flavored gum. Then I’d spit it out when it wasn’t sweet anymore. In my defense, my mom didn’t let us have a lot of sweets.
Men of Reddit, how do you deal with anxiety affecting your sexual performance?	Get some Viagra, that will increase your confidence and then you shouldn't need it. Although if that doesn't work after a few times stop taking it cause you don't wanna get dependent on it.	Speak to her about it and take the pressure out of the situation. It happens to all of us, and the more you pressure yourself to get and stay hard, the harder it gets (= the softer your dick stays). What always helps me is going down on my girlfriend or me playing with her in a seemingly non-sexual situation.
Men with daughters, at what age will my little girl stop letting me give her a big hug in front of the school when I drop her off?	I hope never, but I know I'm wrong. I don't have a girl mind you, but a little boy that makes my day every time I come home.	Depends on the kid. I have 2 daughters. One wanted me to stop around 12, and then started hugging me in front of her friends again a few years later. The other is older, and never stopped. Slightly OT....NEVER STOP HUGGING THEM. There will come a time when you will feel really uncomfortable hugging your daughter, putting your arm around her, etc. The first time you realize she no longer has the shape of a little girl...a lot of men feel a little weird. But don't stop. Don't let on that it makes you uncomfortable. When she starts going through puberty, doubts and discomfort ABOUND in her heart and mind. And if Daddy, who has always been affectionate and loving, all the sudden pulls away from hugs, right at that time, it can be very hard for her.
My girlfriend is manipulative, using techniques to get what she wants. what do?	First of all, since it sounds like you are pretty much broke anyway, you should just leave and pick up the pieces in an environment where you aren't being manipulated. It will be tough financially, but you'll get through it. If you refuse to leave you're a dumbass, but perhaps you can make the situation a little better by not letting her walk all over you. Google "passing shit tests" and then apply what you learn.	Emotionally detach yourself from her, put on a fake smile and dump her when you're in a financial position where you can. Don't get stuck into this one, being alone is better than a relationship like that.
How often do you text with a girl you're casually dating?	If you've been on 5 dates without anything physical she's probably not that into you. I never text a woman "for shits and giggles" because that's typically code for "provide something of value to me." Attraction typically doesn't work by the man asking the woman to provide value. I only text when I have something of value to provide.	I personally would like a guy I’m seeing to check in. If I’m seeing you I like you and enjoy talking to you. I usually text with the guy I’m dating daily and would be bothered if we didn’t talk all week. So depends on the girl and the relationship
Women with low libidos, does it bother you if your SO masturbates a lot?	I get that sometimes you need a little extra to get into the mood, but that doesn't mean you should push the responsibility of sex in a relationship to your man. That's not fair. Not everyone's libido is the same. If your isn't the same as his, you should be ok with him "putting matters into his own hand" as an alternative to meet his needs, and yours.	No, do what you gotta do. >Would it make you feel less validated/desired if your SO just masturbated a lot more to compensate for your low libido instead of trying to initiate sex/make you feel desired? Sounds like your SO is trying to be respectful and not push you into having sex because he knows your wants/needs are lower than his. If you want to be desired, you could initiate sex.
How old are you? And whats the most important thing in your life right now?	21- my 1 year old daughter and my boyfriend (not her biological dad but so much better than that). They are both blessings in my life and remind me to keep going and getting high grades in college so I can build a better future for us. Boyfriend is doing the same and treats baby like she is his own even though he became her "dad" when she was 6 month old. Her "sperm donor" bailed. My boyfriend is infinitely better and I think to myself every day how I got so lucky to have met and found this man. I love them both so much!	50- most important thing in my life is finding peaceful living and avoiding drama and “side hustle/grind” culture. Slowing down, seeing the world around me and enjoying life in the present.
How did you mess up a relationship?	Being a pussy by not taking her out to dances, lying/cheating, being a dick, just things that made her stop liking me.	(Potential relationship) freaked out when she asked "how are you single?" Proceeded in demonstrating all my flaws in 2 days. Every. Single. One. A few days later, she stopped texting back.
Would you date a fat girl?	If I think she is FAT, NO. The episode of Catfish isn't realistic. You mean to tell me that the man had absolutely no interest in her physically at all? That he didn't pursue trying to see her before they met, before he opened up his heart and mind and quite possibly soul to her? In other words, became emotionally vulnerable. This isn't a massive issue of betrayal, it's a massive issue of irresponsibility and cowardice. If the man KNEW that he would not go forward with it if she wasn't physically attractive enough to maintain his desire for her then it was his responsibility to ensure she WAS before he went down that road. If a girl in all respects is perfect for me, she wouldn't be fat because she would be: Health conscious. Eat good foods. Exercise consistently. Feel sexy being fit.	I'm sorry - I realise this is not going to be popular. No. I'm just not attracted to fat women. In fact, I like mine slim. HOWEVER, my tastes are by no means universal. Many women do not find me attractive - but I've learned to appreciate that many women DO. Same for big girls. Some guys will not be attracted to you. Accept that and find a guy who *is* attracted to you and your life will be much better for it.
Men, what is the weirdest way you've taken a hit to the groin?	As teens we would play this stupid game called "steel balls" where we'd all sit around with our legs open and toss a lacrosse ball at one another. If you flinched, the thrower/tosser got a free shot with the lacrosse ball.	High school QB hit me with a real bad throw in practice. I would think he was being a dick but I was his blind side tackle which is one of the dumbest people for a QB to piss off.
I just found out my neighbour throws his dead leaves over the fence in to my garden. In what ways do your neighbours suck?	The neighbors right across the street from us had all their stucco sandblasted off today and it was horrifically loud. It physically hurt to be outside and I had to help my sister unpack her car which took like 20 or so minutes going in and out of the house.	My upstairs neighbor came down to complain about our bathroom fan being to loud. He blasts EDM music every night and let's his trash from his balcony fall into our back porch. Haven't said a word to him about it until then. I was like "You aren't serious".
Dog/cat parents, how do you keep your home smelling good with minimal pet odor?	Advice from dog owner who hates cats and doesn’t have a cat: Some peoples homes smell more than others, but there’s almost always a hint of animal smell. Always keep the litter fresh, keep windows open often to get fresh air in. Vacuum and dust often. If you let your pets on furniture make sure you’re deep cleaning said furniture often. It’s better if you have a blanket that they lay on on top of the couch, that way the blanket can just go right in the wash. Also do regular frequent cleaning of your home, don’t neglect your dusting and cleaning under couches. Use candles & furniture polish to keep a fresh scent in. You can also try scented plug ins.	Two Maine Coons. Arm and Hammer litter box. Clean it twice a day if possible. There are no odors at all. They don’t get wet food and they always have a lot of fresh, clean water. That prevents problems with their urine and faeces smelling badly. More time is spent dealing with mountains of fluff. There are special brushes and products to clean that so it’s not a big deal either.
Those of your who live with your SO, what is your evening routine like?	Get home from work, work in the yard, do our dogs insulin, feed the other dogs, feed the cats, feed ourselves, say we're gonna take the dogs for a walk and don't do it, go to bed	We work near each other so most nights we have a drink with each other and friends before driving home together. We usually do about 20-30 mins down time talking about our day and feeding cats/doing chores once we get home and then one of us makes dinner (or orders if we’re lazy). It’s the clean up and throw on a show or movie. I always lie down and cuddle up and almost every night fall asleep on my SO’s lap. At some point he goes and puts the electric blanket on and wakes me at 11.30 to put me to bed. Mon-Thurs are pretty standard routine and I wouldn’t change it for the world.
Do you think it is possible to feel heartbreak over someone you never truly dated?	Yep. Hell, I've felt hearbreak over someone who never really existed. Was in love with a fictional character for over three years, which was possible due to a confluence of circumstances. The being in love part was mostly all good and happy because I knew what I could expect, but when I decided to finally make an active effort to let go, there was definitely heartbreak. I'd gotten used to having 'him' in my life, and the thought of not having that presence (even imagined) and source of little joys was rather upsetting. But obviously, had to move on *sometime*. Probably one of the weirder responses you'll get, lol.	Definitely. One-sided love is pretty heartbreaking. Years ago, I fell hard for a friend who didn't like me back. I had to distance myself and basically grieve because I'd never be with him.
What is something you never have and never will tell your past or present SO?	Honestly, if she was a vegetarian for very long prior to eating that lasagna she would have gotten quite sick from eating that meat.	A was having sex with a girl and a very large spider popped out from behind her head. I smooshed it with my hand and kept going. She had a spider phobia and would tremble at just seeing a photo of one. She will never know.
What's a piece of unsolicited advice you would love to give someone, but you're too decent a person to say it to them?	"You don't need that (insert food item here)" To almost every overweight person I see. It's fucked up, but it just goes through my head.	To my really good friends: "I love you both but you guys REALLY need to take care of your cats and change the damn litter box and get them fixed. Your apartment smells so bad I had when I walk in. Your unfixed male cats spray everything and it's disgusting. I saw one of you earlier and YOU reeked too. You probably can't even notice it anymore, but it's fucking gross."
What’s a self care thing you do that you swear by?	Don’t have small children. Reading through the top comments I don’t have time for showers clean sheets and brushing my teeth. One day I will but not now.	I made changing my sheets a happy event thing. Each Monday I change my sheets and do a pamper evening thing, with a facemask, a longgg shower with scrub, loads of lotions after. Have a nice drink,maybe do yoga. Then when I'm at the cleanest I'll ever be, I'll grab a fresh pair of pj's and go to bed early to enjoy some shows in my little cocoon of perfect.
Men who dress well on a reasonable budget, what’s your strategy?	> reasonable budget If you make 250k a year, "reasonable" is very different than if you make 25k a year.	Dude...depending on where you live, hit up the outlet stores...or stores like Marshall’s, Ross, Winners, etc. A lot of brand name stuff at very good prices. My college roommate used to have to the nicest shit. Found out he would hit the thrift store...and apparently they even have brand new stuff that people donate and never wore. Which makes complete sense, because I would donate things I bought and never wore after it was in my closet for a long time. Impulse buys.... You got options.
Following on from the “Why don’t you get a man to do that” thread, what was your worst experience of being told “You’re a woman so you should do that”?	One times my ex's dad got mad at him cause I was carrying my laundry downstairs... And apparently he should be doing it for me... I didn't know I was so weak..	Any time there's a baby that needs holding. No thanks man, I'll pass unless I'm the only one there to help.
Females of the military, how bad was/is the sexual harassment/discrimination you had or are facing?	My friend has a wife that is in the reserve. Whenever she gets back from drill, for the next month or so she gets constant Facebook messages and texts from dudes saying shit like "yeah I know you have a husband, I don't care", "come on, let's just fuck, I won't say shit", and "baby there is no way your husband will find out, I know you want it" Oh yeah, of course, constant dick pics and body shots. On one hand, it's sickening, on the other hand. She's kinda trashy. I think she welcomes it and enjoys showing her husband to make him jealous... Still though...	Pretty rampant. On the mild end of it, things like being asked who's dick I sucked to make rank so fast was pretty common. Bets going around to see who could fuck one of the new arrivals first, shit like that. I didn't realize how bad it really was, though, until I hit the higher ranks and had junior sailors coming up to me wondering if they should report being raped, assaulted, or harassed. Most never report. Then there's the problem with women regretting sleeping with someone, or using rape charges to get back at exes or one night stands that didn't pan out. The whole thing is a fucking mess.
You have an unlimited budget, 48 contestants and a one year time span to film a 52 episode seasson: What kind of reality show would you create and why?	A hunger games type situation for criminals on death row- volunteer based only. If they win and there's no chance of rehabilitation, they get a luxury suite with all the amenities of a five star life (while still being incarcerated) for the rest of their lives. If they win and there's a chance of rehabilitation, same thing until they are rehabilitated.	Put 50 skilled people (carpenters, survivalists, nurses, etc.) on a deserted island and let them "build" a society over the course of a year. No voting people off, no competitions for prizes - just literally letting them live and build and create and fight and live for a year. There was that "Utopia" show that was kind of similar, but they voted people in and out and had all these mini-competitions, but I'd want a show that's more about the struggle of rebuilding as opposed to a show that's about people competing to stay. My show wouldn't be a competition - more of a social experiment. I think the drama would produce itself in time.
Is there something you thought made a person more attractive, but then when actually experiencing it you realized you didn't like it?	First, to the OP: thanks for making it *person* not *guy.* My answer? Not wealth as in money, but, like, "uppity" for lack of better term. Turns out, I'm podunk as fuck and if I can't wear jeans to it, I don't really wanna go. I tried dating an 'east coaster' that liked to go to Polo matches and Broadway plays. Just... not my cup of tea	For lack of a better term, intellectualism? I used to think I was really attracted to well-read, "cultured" people who could wax poetic about, well, poetry. And art, music, etc. Oh man I was wrong, there is nothing more boring than dating a smart person who wants to talk at you like they're defending their thesis. Don't get me wrong, the people I date are still intelligent, but they're also *interesting* and good at socializing and can make and appreciate lame jokes and read trashy novels and fanfiction with me.
20, got a girlfriend for a first time. Tips for being a decent boyfriend?	To save yourself a lot of time try not to use logic or reason during arguments but just explain how you feel about it. After learning about this I honestly felt like I had cracked Enigma. All of the sudden my fights shortened by a lot and they lasted maybe 15 minutes and I was hearing the other person apologize. Here's the thing about feelings you can't argue against them, if I feel like you're being unfair about something you can't provide a counter argument because mine is just based on emotion. I noticed this is what girls do in a lot of arguments so I just mimicked it, it has since saved me a lot of headache and strangely enough the issues actually got resolved vs when I tried to use reason which just turned things into a bigger cluster fuck.	You're already trying to be a decent boyfriend, which in itself is a good sign that you are going to do alright. Just pay attention to details, communicate, and listen to her, and you should be golden. Be wary that she doesn't take advantage of you though! It is all too easy for that to happen, and they don't say "love is blind" for no reason.
Woman, when was the last time you were truly angry with someone?	Someone I personally know? In May. When the guy I had a plan with did the exact same shit he did years ago and had the date we planned to have together with another woman and didn't even bother to tell me he changed his mind about our plan.	Yesterday, my friends deciding to go out with a man with a serious domestic violence, substance abuse and bad arrest history. She barely knows him but says he’s so much fun. It just bothers me so much because most victims don’t get these warning signs and she’s choosing to ignore them
Black women: How do you want white women to be allies, or to be helpful, in fighting racism? Do you want us to be actively engaged and if so how?	Please keep in mind both this question and the rules of the subreddit while replying. This question is "Black women: How do you want white women to be allies, or to be helpful, in fighting racism? Do you want us to be actively engaged and if so how?" Top level answers should answer that question, and then replies to top level-level answers need to be on topic inorder to not be derailing. For example, being a white woman touching other white women's hair. It's an innocent contribution, but it's just not relevant to the discussion. Also, as a reminder, things like dismissing the premise of the question, reporting the question because you don't like that black women have a platform, and outright racism will not be tolerated. Take it somewhere else if you just need to be an asshole today.	Please keep in mind both this question and the rules of the subreddit while replying.

Girls, what is something about men which makes you realize they will probably be a dud boyfriend over time?	If they talk about having kids, and talk about their career plans as future "must-haves" and doesn't acknowledge that any time sacrifices or delays in their career will need to be made so they can take care of their children, especially during the early years.	Never following through on things. Saying "Let's do X" or "I think we should go to Y" or "I need to Z" and then making excuses for why those things can't happen now when you bring them up.
Why are people going crazy over "Frozen"?	I really love the music, and I really like Elsa as a character. Elsa, Merida and Mulan stand out as my favourite female leads. She and Merida had no romantic interest whatsoever. Mulan went to war, I think having a love story was fair.	You also have to keep in mind that the movie's been out for awhile, and yeah, there's been hype. So if you were going in expecting the movie to be AMAZING, it'd be hard for it to live up to your standards. You're likely hearing a lot of hype from people who went in expecting it to be average, or hoping they'd enjoy it, and wound up enjoying it far more than they thought they would - hence the excited reactions. I loved it, thanks largely to the sister element to it (I'm very close with my sister), the music, and Olaf. I thought he was adorable.
Guys who have dated girls who smoke weed regularly, what was your experience?	Dude, what, smoking makes no difference really. She'll probably find tv shows more funny than you do. I'm a smoker, I've dated and created smokers, it makes no difference.	She was really cool. Sort of a hippie, but cool as hell. Do yourselves a favour -- keep healthy snacks around the house. Pineapple, kiwi, oranges...and some junk food too, just in case. If you give a stoner a snack, you've a friend for life!
Vegans of AW: What made you decide to go vegan?	I was already vegetarian for about five years, and hadn't really eaten much meat in about ten years before that. A vegan friend recommended I watch Earthlings to understand why he was vegan and I just gave up eggs and dairy there and then. I've always been kind of a picky eater so I've ended up eating much better since I turned vegan (I basically lived off dairy products before). I'm more willing to try new foods (so long as they're vegan), and I cook for myself much more often. I would say I'm much healthier as a vegan than I was as a vegetarian.	The trifecta: 1) Animal cruelty 2) The environment (animal agriculture is horrible for the environment) 3) My health The catalyst - one of the various documentaries on animal agriculture. I went pescatarian for a month, vegetarian for 3 months then full vegan. The step down method is how I prevented failure from lack of cooking ideas. It's hard to wipe your recipe repitour clean and start over; it can easily lead to frustration, overwhelm and giving up. Noticeable changes: I feel AMAZING! I've been lactose intolerant my entire life and had been conveniently ignoring it because cheese is delicious. I also don't feel really tired after meals, and my fitness gains have been incredible. I weight lifted and did other various forms of exercise before and after going vegan. My muscle/lifting gains happen so much faster and I finally have cardio stamina which eluded me for the longest time.
Does your dream lesbian wedding involve two tuxes, two dresses, one of each, or other clothing options for the couple?	Two dresses, but only if I get to pick out both dresses because I am a control freak with specific taste.	I'm a femme who loves femmes. So two dresses. My idea for the aisle is either two aisles and we meet in the middle, OR one of us walks the aisle and the other one is raised up from an underground platform amidst a buncha smoke and laser lights.
Have you ever found out someone's impression of you was completely off?	When I was at a bar with my then-future-roommate she asked if I was interested in anybody. I happened to be into someone that she knew so I told her who. She then said "Aww, she's really nice, but I don't think she's the kind of girl who sleeps around." Absolutely blew my mind that she thought I was some kind of player. I can be very friendly and open with guys and girls I'm not interested in, but once I am with a girl that I am interested in I get very shy. I wonder if other people think I'm super successful with women and if that influences what they think of me...	One of my friends told me that she avoided talking to me for a long time because she thought I was too cool. I have literally never in my life been too cool for anything but school.
Women of reddit: What is one thing about being a man you think you couldn't deal with if you were one?	Assuming that if I were male my gender identity would also be masculine (if my gender identity remained the same, the biggest problem would be that I no longer get to be cisgendered), I think the biggest irritant would be the pressure that men seem to feel (and some men seem to perpetuate towards other men) to meet a ridiculously narrow definition of "manly". Of course, I can't even begin to speculate how I'd feel about this pressure if my gender identity were male.	Sometimes I hear men talk about not feeling sexy or desired by women because the gender roles in our society encourage men to be the active participants who show their desire and women to be the passive objects who desire is acted out upon. As a woman this is also pretty crappy for me and I don't like it, but I think the reverse situation men find themselves in doesn't sound nice either. Sometimes men will post in this sub asking if women even find men attractive, and I think it must be unpleasant to live life wondering that.
Men that have been pressured by women into engaging in sexual interactions, what was that situation and how did you handle it? How has it thereon affected you?	Any girl that's pressured for sex got the sex, unless she smelled bad, or was ugly. That's been my rule. I go along with it with a curious and pushy girl 100% of the time if she looks physically healthy and if I'm single. Why wouldn't I? I like sex.	She wanted to have sex with me one night but I didn't want to. So she tried to make me jealous by hitting on my friend. They started dating, now It's been 2 years and they're still together so I guess that worked out pretty well for them.
What is a white lie that blew up on you?	Was staying at my MIL's house. Took her clothes out of the dryer to do my own laundry and put them back in when I was done. She later asked me if I did laundry and I said no. She called me out because the settings on the wash were different than what she usually uses. Said she felt "lied to" and now makes it very obvious that she no longer trusts or likes me. I never thought I'd be the SO that a MIL hated.... but I made it.... because I lied about doing laundry.	I often tell people I don't have a smart phone if they ask me to download an app or use navigation on my phone or something. This happened at a work conference and my manager got irritated when he saw me using my phone later, after I told him "I don't have a smartphone" as a reason I didn't download the conference app. Yes, I do have a smart phone. Unfortunately, it's a Windows phone, and most apps don't even bother making a Windows OS version of their app, so I can't use them. But explaining that to people is a pain in the ass so it's easier to just say I don't have a smart phone.
DAE ever date a woman just because, "Well, she's interested, it's not like anybody else is, I'm lonely and maybe she's cool"?	I do this too but I have come to realize the only girls I "genuinely" fall in "love" with are the super hot ones. I've learned to not be so entitled and my girlfriend of 2 years is not a supermodel, but loyal. The really beautiful model looking girls have the choice of the most powerful men in the world. It's a supply and demand reality. Average men don't get above average women.	If a girl is interested in me I will always be interested back because 100% of the time if I'm interested in a girl *first* it's never reciprocal. Girls liking me first = 100% success rate Me liking girls first = 0% success rate.

Stolen from r/AskWomen: Men, what are some culture shocks you've experienced when traveling abroad?	South America is a breastfeeding bonanza continent. There are no issues anywhere. In front of family, in public, around strangers, children or anywhere. Mothers will yank that titty out and the baby just digs in. The mothers do not go to a corner or different room. They do not cover up. No one cares. Except this buffoon of an American who nearly chokes on whatever drink or food he has in his mouth when he sees it.	How aggresive the french (Paris) are when it comes to driving, cought me really off guard. Heard the carhorn go off more times in one weekend then I've heard in my entire life in Norway. I'm suprised I didn't see anyone crash. Also Poland, I didn't know that they had stripclubs/brotles since they're so catholic.
Has anyone heard of the term "starter wife"? Is it a thing that actually happens?	I WAS A STARTER GIRLFRIEND. I didn't know it was a thing, omg. It makes sense. I MADE HIM. He was a super shy, useless virgin when I met him. Could barely talk to his own family shy. Never had a job or made himself useful at all. I got him his first car, I kept it maintained, made appointments, got his car insurance, made him amazing in bed, got him a job, got him in school, helped him with his second job, organized the buying of our house, took care of WVERYTHING. Got him his new car, helped him make a savings account and then 'I'm moving out don't love you bye'. FOR A YOUNGER GIRL. I FEEL BETTER.	I know a few women who were starter wives. I feel pretty bad for them because, as far as I can tell, their main offense was growing old.
Men who were beaten as a punishment as a child, how has it effected you growing up?	I don't hold grudges, it fucked me up in the short term but ultimately saved me from going down the wrong path. Makes me sad when I see kids acting out and knowing their parents will give in and reward them for being less cunty. Slap the little shits and if they cry, slap them again.	Grandfather was a sweet man. I was being a shithead once and he spanked my butt. One smack. I never gave him attitude again. There is a huge gap between spanking your child once and beating them till they're bruised.
Very new girlfriend is thinking about getting back with her ex. What do I do?	I would tell her to figure things out and come back to you if she wants. At this point, you guys aren't even exclusively dating anymore (at least emotionally) so there's no point in trying to hang on to her. You can try to explain things to her all you want, but sometimes you have to let her figure things out through experience. If this girl really does mean a lot to you, be a good friend to her and be there for her when the grade-A douche canoe hurts her. Staying with her romantically isn't fair to you when she's splitting her emotions multiple ways. The disagree button is in full effect today...	If you have to fight to keep her, you don't have her in the first place. It's like ripping off a bandaid, but I'd recommend taking the initiative and ending things yourself. Even if you "win her over" she might end up going with him again behind your bank.
Guys who need a lot of space in relationships, how do you typically deal with a girlfriend who wants to spend more time with you?	Sidestep the attempt if I'm not about it -> radio silence -> done. Don't press me on shit either, that gets you a hard next. Let things happen organically, and if you can't vibe with me off jump and feel things out I'll find someone who can. It's all a numbers game, why waste time on incompatibility.	I recently broke up with my girlfriend because of this. I need my alone time, and everytime I said I needed some time alone, even if it was *literally* just a couple of hours, she's get super upset and next time there was an argument, she'd always bring up "You don't even want to spend time with me!" or a variation thereof... In hindsight, it's a miracle that relationship even lasted as long as it did...
"Women need to feel loved to have sex. Men need to have sex to feel loved…'' Thoughts?	Also, why the fuck did the men of AskMen think that they had such an insight into the psyches of all *women*??	I don't think it's necessarily a men vs women thing. But some PEOPLE absolutely do need sex and intimacy to feel loved by and bonded to their partners. Yes.
What is an issue that you and your female friends will never see eye-to-eye on?	Marriage makes no sense for men. There is no reason for the modern male to ever marry. It tethers his future and freedom to a document that will NEVER end in his favor when things fall apart. Expansion on the above: modern women are not trustworthy.	The only one I can think of is female and male sex toys. One of my good friends won't even take male sex toys seriously. Then I get into an argument with her talking about how that's a double standard. So women can have dildos and that's fine but if men have a fleshlight, that's disgusting? We never talked about it again.
What’s the worst way a girl has ever broke the “girl code” with you?	# Friendly mod reminder here that our [Gendered Slurs Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/genderedslurs) still applies to this thread. There are a LOT of poorly-behaved friends/women in the stories in this thread, but you still do not get to use a slur against them.	# Friendly mod reminder here that our [Gendered Slurs Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/genderedslurs) still applies to this thread. There are a LOT of poorly-behaved friends/women in the stories in this thread, but you still do not get to use a slur against them.
I don't like who I become in relationships, does anyone else have this problem?	Yes, this happens to me. I would get frustrated because I felt like I had to "be the adult" in every situation. My SO is eight years my senior, so it annoyed me to no end. However, I'm trying (and I think succeeding) at being more patient. He's had a very different, very relaxed upbringing/early adulthood. That really made a difference in how he operates in life. It's difficult, but is getting better.	Yep exactly why I left my last one. I feel like when I'm in a relationship I focus my attention 100% on them. do what they want and kinda just forget about myself. This makes me resent them and then I get mad for no reason. I've decided to just enjoy the 'me time', until I feel ready to share myself with someone.
Has anybody else encountered guys who can't handle the sight of pubic hair on a woman?	Oh god yes I knew one like that. I myself prefer being clean down there but the way he emphasised on how disgusting and what a dealbreaker it was ticked me off. Stop seeing him real quick.	I had a great first date with a guy once, and we decided to fool around in my car afterward. He stuck his hand down my pants at a certain point, then froze and asked me, "Hey, if we continued dating, would you be cool with shaving this?" Points to him for getting that out of the way I guess, but also pretty bad timing. We didn't go out again, although it wasn't because of that.
What has always been your biggest insecurity as a man?	My height. I'm doing well in all other "man" categories but I'm 5'10", which isn't short but isn't tall. I want to be like 6'1".	My lack of a successful career. I've never wanted to be or do anything in particular. Without that direction and drive, I just sort of ended up in a job that sustains me financially but is by no means impressive to anyone. It's less important for me to have a high-paying job since I have no plans to have children and support a family, but it does bruise my ego to just be a working drone with no sense of "success."
Redditors who have been happily married for 10 + years: What do you and your partner do to stay so happy and stable in your relationship for so long?	Give each other plenty of space, and even MORE respect. NEVER take your partner for granted, and as a man, I defer to my spouse on all family matters except the finances (I pay for everything) which I control. Also, never fail to show affection and attention in every way possible. Holding hands when out and about, holding the door for her, following the "ladies first" rule, and simple common courteousy to each other.	Understand that the "In love" feeling comes and goes. Sometimes it is important to be committed to the Relationship because your feelings for the person can change at times, life stressors change. Source: married 33 years.
Fucking hell, I wish today was over. How are you doing, right this minute?	Not super great. Arguing and long talks with MrCirocco, very sick horse, potentially sick dog, a wake to go to on Saturday for a family friend's husband. And lots of work to do. Difficult weekend :(	Emotionally drained. My ex boyfriend passed away on Monday and his wake is tomorrow. My heart broke knowing someone I used to love is no longer there anymore Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words. I attended his wake and it was very hard to be there. His mother was happy to see me again and her and his aunts found comfort because my ex had cared for me so much they were happy to have me there. It's been a rough week.
If your SO goes away internationally for a holiday without you, how often would you ideally like to communicate with them while away, and would you be interested to see look through all their photos when they return?	On vacation without me? Woman traveling by herself? Nah... Not happening. That's a recipe for, “it was in another country so it doesn't count"	It'd be nice if my wife sent a little something every day, just so I know she wasn't Taken 3 Don't want her glued to the phone by any means though
What was the scariest instance of street harassment that has happened to you?	On behalf of the male species - I'm sorry. I don't understand the logic or rationale that anyone could use to make these things acceptable in their head. But I guess that's it..it's not logical or rational. These guys can't seriously think that you will all suddenly swoon because they asked for a kiss, stalked you, or yelled inappropriate things at you. I'm makes me ashamed to be human really.	Probably the men who tried to drag me into their car after the blizzard in London in January,1982. A man and his dog were the main reason I wasn't forced in their car. A very close second was the cab driver who stopped me in front of my house and told me he followed me every single day on my way to secondary school. He said knew which house was mine and I was so beautiful and wouldn't I give him my number and be his girlfriend? That was worse than the blokes trying to abduct me, because I was having panic attacks for weeks and all cabs look alike. Every time I saw a cab, I was panicking for a month and my mother just pooh-pointed it. I never saw him again, to the best of my knowledge.
Men of Reddit: Where is the weirdest place you found one of your girlfriend's hairs?	On MY toothbrush. We both keep our brushes in the shower but they are ip high where youd think hair wasnt going bear.	One of my ex's long hairs (her hair was down to her lower back) somehow wound its way into my video card cooling fan and completely jammed it up and caused it to overheat.
What do you think the hardest thing about being a woman would be?	Since most women never initiate, they have a lot of power in the dating market. Unfortunately, this means they also have the task of doing a *lot* of rejecting. I hate giving people bad news. I'd hate telling a bunch of guys "no, you're not good enough for me" over and over again.	Everything about pregnancy. Much of your sex is in fear of it and then when you want to get pregnant you have to be miserable for months and then deliver a bowling ball as the reward. Good times
What's the funniest thing your pet has ever done?	One of my chickens got stuck in a gate. She thought she could fit through the bars but she was too phat and it was hilariously sad because somehow her wings wrapped around the bars and I was afraid she'd get injured if she exerted herself too much. She could only look at me and her friends with no expression because chickens can't smile or cry. I got her out really carefully and she was fine though.	My two cats regularly stage WWE style cage matches in the bathtub. But the ginger one is often startled by various things like his own tail or the sudden appearance of a kitchen chair that has been in the same position for at least a week, starts to run, forgets where he is in the house and slams headlong into a wall. Then wanders off, sits down and licks his tail like 'I totally meant to do that.'
Ladies, what's your all-time favorite recipe?	Tie, between pumpkin chip cookies, and a chicken casserole recipe. I don't make it often, but when I do, people love it. It's chicken, shredded, with spices, covered in corn dough. What's not to like? I also have a vegan lasagna recipe that I've taken to parties and even the non vegans devoured it.	For breakfast: Avocado toast. Just toast a slice of bread, mash up half an avocado on top, add two slices of tomato and some feta, and finish with a pinch of garlic salt and sriracha. So easy. So good. So filling.
When you were broke (or if you currently are), in what ways does/ did it "cost a lot to be poor"?	My mom makes $90,000 a year working as an R.N., which was too much money for me to receive financial aid for college. So, I had to take out the loans for my $26,000 yearly tuition. I get that she makes a lot of money annually, but how is she supposed to give me 30% of her annual income to go to school?! Luckily, I got grants for grad school.	One of the biggest ones I remember was being too broke to afford a bus pass so I'd have to pay the fare everytime. I'd spend way more every month than a bus pass (especially because I would have got a student discount on the pass) but I didn't have enough for that upfront purchase.
What is one thing you wish you could say to your SO but don't feel that you can?	I need a baby. Like, soon. If we don't have a baby before I'm 27 I'm seriously worried that I'll have to divorce you.	I'm still incredibly attracted to you, but I wish that you would lose weight, because I am worried about your health and want you to live forever.
How do people around you "get in their own way" socially without realising?	Hey, so I threw a blow-out-huge party only once for my 21st. I made the fb event weeks in advance, posted to the group like once a week w various promotional pictures, had called up a friend who lived in a PARTY HOUSE and he agreed to host, and when it came close I texted / messaged people personally to come on and get shwasted. It was fantastic! But it took a LOT of planning. I feel like I'm pretty well known but I wouldn't throw a party short notice for sure :( **EDIT: to answer your original question, I feel like I am one of those people who "get their way" and its all about speaking up. Also my friends think I'm funny**	I know a guy who's really nice, but he's just so *loud*. Slams his stuff on the desks/tables, watches videos on his iPod without headphones, sighs super loudly, etc. I like talking to him, but I also get annoyed whenever he enters the room because he sounds like a stampede of elephants.
what lies or evasions have you told to 'save face' for the male pride of men in your life?	I don't have time for that crap. I wouldn't be spending time with men who were hung up on "male pride." I can't deal with gendered nonsense in my life.	My boyfriend fibbed to friends about how I dragged him to yoga with me so he could save face and I let it go, when he really invited himself (and really enjoyed it.)
Do any of you regret motherhood? Women 40-50+ with no children, how is your life?	SAHM mom in my late 20s. No regrets at all. I'm still active and have my own life. It can be done reddit, don't let anyone tell you it cannot. Having a helpful partner is the key.	I love my kids very much but raising children is a all encompassing venture. You will lose yourself, at least for a while, it will take a toll on your marriage on some level, it's a huge commitment. The only reason to plan for children is because you want children. There have been many days I wished that I had taken another path, but that's magical thinking. Do not have children unless you really, really want children. And don't feel guilty about not wanting children. It doesn't make you a bad, selfish, or lesser person.
Have you ever had a bad gut feeling about someone? Was your gut right?	My intuition is always on point. There are just some people I don't trust or feel bad vibes from. My friends are quick to call me judgmental until they realize that I'm always right.	I'd always thought one of my childhood friends' father was scary and didn't like seeing him, much less speaking with him. We carpooled though, so it was unavoidable. Turns out he's violent and a fucking child molester and he's currently serving 15 or 20 years in prison for aggravated assault resulting in a serious bodily injury.
Whenever I get acquainted with a woman I develop a “crush” on them. I don’t actually like them romantically, I’m just excited over the idea of a relationship. How do I stop this?	If you start going out with a girl, an imperative thing to honour is the three month rule. Don't make it serious until after three months, because at that point you essentially know if you like them for them or you like the idea of them (i.e. crushing on them). At 3 months, if you are honest with yourself, you will be able to decide whether it is a good match or not.	I was always that way when I first met a new girl. The newness wears away and if you really like them, you'll know. You are totally normal.
Thoughts on taking your SO's last name for marriage?	I took my husband's last name. I guess it depends on the amount of attachment that you have to your maiden name. On another note, my sister-in-law recently got married and her husband took her last name, instead of her taking his. Now that's weird to me.	I don't think I would, unless their name is a lot cooler than mine. If I marry my current SO, we did have a pretty awesome idea. We both have the same middle name, so we thought it'd be cool for us both to switch our middle and last names. So in that case, we'd have the same last name, but we'd keep all 3 names given to us at birth (just a different order). That seems confusing so here's a (made-up) example. My name: Jordan Carter Wright SO's name: Lucy Carter Brown New names: Jordan Wright Carter and Lucy Brown Carter
How have you unknowingly Pavlov'd yourself, or another person?	A lot of times my SO gets boners just having me around, fully clothed. I come home, he sees me, and then gets a boner. Also, my dog used to have a long lead we would put him on to let him wander the backyard without straying too far. It was made out of some kind of polymer so in the dead of winter I guess it got too cold and it snapped. I realized this when he was asking to go out in the freezing early morning, so I just attached the 2ft broken end to his collar and sent him out. He stayed right within the range the full lead used to have.	If I'm with a group of people and they're taking too long to leave I jingle my keys. Since most people associate that sound with leaving, they usually get out the door in a few seconds without me nagging.
Ladies, I just puked in front of a customer. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done at work?	I almost cried in front of a bunch of coworkers in another department. It was that time of the month and another coworker in that same department was being kinda rude (and later talked about me to one of the coworkers in my department, who ended up defending me). All of this on my anniversary... Kinda soured things :/	I was joking around with a coworker while no one was in the store. He said something and I yelled "no one loves you and Santa doesn't exist either!" When I turned around there was a Mom and little girl in the doorway. The girl started crying. I got written up for telling a kid that Santa doesn't exist.
What is the least selfish thing you have ever had done for you in a relationship? What is the most selfish thing you've ever experienced in a relationship?	Least selfish I have done: to help a girl in stuff which could give her more chance with her actual crush which happened not to be me. And I knew. Most selfish thing I have experienced: the girl I was dating lied to me not to lose my material support (rides, lunches, gifts) in spite that she had a quite formal relationship with other guy.	Most selfless: The last girl I dated cushioned my fall when I passed out in the bathroom taking a piss after coming home from a hernia repair surgery.
Do you ever feel like your period invalidates your emotions? If so, how do you sort out the real emotions from the hormones?	Only with my dog. He gets on my nerves so much when I'm PMSing but there's no reason for me to get annoyed by just normal doggin behavior. He doesn't annoy me otherwise, so I try to ignore my annoyance when it's that time of the month.	They're all real emotions, and actually when I'm more hormonal and ornery, I'm less tolerant of stuff I really shouldn't tolerate anyway, so it works out to my benefit.
What are your thoughts on waiting for sex until marriage?	It's primarily something that naive children and overly religious people believe in, therefore not something that an adult woman who is compatible with me would believe in or want. I'm not going to waste time on a woman who insists upon that, especially once she's out of early adulthood and likely actually serious about sticking to her guns on the matter, rather than liable to say nuts to that after finally getting aroused and wanting to fuck someone.	It would be a non-starter for me but I wouldn't give you flak for it. Your body, your choices, your life.
Have you ever asked a girl out even though you assumed she would say no?	I have unacceptable skin condition, so asking out is not an option. My action corresponding to your asking out is asking a woman to talk with me. I did that 120+ times in the last 4 and a half years and only this month I've succeeded for the first time. So there were more than hundred times when I assumed they'd refuse, often harshly and vulgarly, and all but one actually did. I guess this is irrelevant to you.	Every single time. So if she says no I won't be disappointed and if she says yes I get a pleasant surprise. And it works. Does it increase my success rate? Sort of, I asked out more people so there is a chance they say yes compared to not asking and not having a chance at all.
Do you ask a girl what she likes or wants before having sex?	Never ask. That's pussy shit. Girls are turned on by guys that know what they want and act on it.	Keep it vanilla the first few time, then have a grown up conversation, not in the middle of sex about each persons kinks and limits.
How do you deal with long hair without going bonkers?	I don't. I just chopped it into a layered bob again from almost waist length. I used to have a pixie, that was fun and easy to take care of. The balls of hair I would find in my laundry drove me nuts. The shedding everywhere, the constant need for brushing, always losing my hair ties, the stupid amount of product and conditioner, the ridiculous amount of time it took to wash, the fact that I somehow lost the ability to do Dutch braids, the feel of it against my neck - all of it made me crazy.	Yes! Same question! I once had a pixie cut and once I grew it long again I could no longer eat with my hair down. I absolutely have to tie it up or it annoys me to no end
Women of /r/AskMen, what do you use this subreddit for?	Small PSA: We understand that some people do not like a certain sub, however it's got to the point of being a worn out tired circlejerk over the years that is simply boring. You're more than entitled to have your opinions on subreddits but nothing is worse than dudes (or girls) jerking it and just a dribble or even a just a puff of dusty air coming out. Think of it like closing an old, heavy dusty book.

Think of it like closing an old, heavy dusty book.
Guys who have been lifting consistently for a long time, what does your diet look like on a day-to-day basis?	After morning workout: whey protein mixed in milk/soymilk Before leaving for work: protein smoothie (consisting of banana, yogurt, a little egg white, cereal, milk/soymilk, peanut butter, and almonds/walnuts) Lunch: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; gulp it down with a bit of fruit juice Dinner: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; with this I have a green smoothie (consisting of banana, carrots, broccoli, celery, red lettuce, and a bit of fruit juice). Before sleep: some cottage cheese (I don't always have this though)	Shitty mostly. The lifting I can do, the diet I suck at. I generally bake chicken, cut up some broccoli and carrots and mix it with rice with some teriyaki sauce. Pretty good stuff. Breakfast is typically oatmeal with some cinnamon and brown sugar. Then dinner usually varies. Last week it was pesto chicken with veggies. Sounds healthy. But last night I also ate cookies that my wife bought. I drink too much soda (soda has got to be my worst offence). I often eat frozen pizzas on weekends. Overall I eat well enough to maintain my weight but have a hard time cutting.
Do you happen to fulfill a stereotype or trope in anyway? If you do, what is it?	I'm a hot gamer girl (and before anybody asks yes I'm a real gamer, the only console I dont own is xbox and I have 2 gaming computers) I'm also a lazy stoner And I'm a girl that's borderline obsessed with my nails and hair	I'm a black guy who's dad left. I wear glasses and I'm a nerd. I'm a virgin and I use reddit. I'm fat and I like gaming.
What fashion faux-pas do you make a POINT to break?	Pyjamas out of the house. I can't be arsed with proper trousers or jeans anymore, especially when it's a Sunday morning and I'm just out to the shops to get some milk. PJ bottoms or leggings are all I wanna be in.	Wearing oversized sweaters despite having a larger-than-average rack. I don't care if I look like a pregnant potato from the side, I'm comfortable as hell.
Ladies with partners, is there something that bothers you about them that you have or will never mention? If so, why?	I certainly don't plan to marry any time soon, but my partner would really like a diamond of some kind on their engagement ring, and I would just much rather make her one myself (I have experience in fine metal working and have a lot of jeweller friends to help) and I just don't like gemstones on rings. I really don't have problems with my partner (except slight incompatible love languages, but that's more my fault)	He is so relaxed about things like planning and communication. His entire family is. Getting him to make a concrete plans is like pulling teeth.
Fit men of AskMen, is it important that your SO be fit too?	Not really. My wife was fit when we got together and is now pregnant. I still fuck her 4 times a day. When she delivers our son I will continue to fuck her as much as I can. Just because I make it a point to be fit doesn't necessarily mean I require my wife to be fit too. When she gives birth she will probably hit the gym and get back in shape.	Absolutely. I am not physically attracted to girls that are clearly overweight. Does she need a flat stomach? No, but a good body is a must because physical attraction is important to me. Working out is also just a way to show you care about yourself. I don't care how much you lift or how much cardio you do as long as you get there and do work. I don't want to be with someone who can't keep up with me in every day life because they are too out of shape. Plus I think the dedication is hot.
Who was the last girl you rejected and why?	There's a girl I'm currently hooking up with but she wants to make it a thing. I'm actually not into her and she's kinda just a confidence boost for me right now. She actually just asked me if we could sit down and talk soon so I figure this is gunna be a conversation about taking things to the next level. I'm gunna say no and probably end things.	She is my [2nd]cousins best friend. They are both barely 14 and I am 35. That whole conversation was awkward AF. 14 year old girls can be uncomfortably forward. Good thing my 1st cousin was there and heard everything and she told me I handled it like a pro.
What are your stances on paying for a girlfriend's groceries?	If she is going to go hungry, then of course feed her! My wife was hungry in college. If I knew, then I would have given her everything she needed (everything I had). My family had food, I could have packed her a lunch. I could have gave her cash. I spent money on stupid stuff that could have fed her. Now I feel guilty over it. Don’t be me. Buy the girl food if she needs it. Don’t go out and buy warhammer 40,000 army while your girlfriend is eating her friends unwanted leftovers in the university food court. A rice cooker is a great thing!	It's a nice thing you could do, although are not expected to. The points that jump out at me though are- * How comfortable was she asking? A lot of people do this as a last resort and really loathe asking, but some live off it. I'd be suspect that she asked at least.... * It could indicate that she's irresponsible with money
What is your shameful confession that's only really shameful within your particular social group or sub-culture?	Saying anything good about capitalism is a no no among the youth these days. Also, I feel like because I'm very socially liberal that I'm lumped with these crazy extremist that want to be a victim of everything. No I don't like the idea of mass censorship because something is offensive. I think people get far too worked up over everything and ironically turn into authoritarians in order to stop all things they find hurtful.	I rarely watch or read the news. Basically I catch what's going on through Reddit and Twitter and when it's of particular interest or importance I will look into it more. I'm the lead reporter/senior editor of a newspaper...
Ladies who are currently in a relationship or married, what do you like the most about your SO?	I am myself around her in a way I simply am not with anyone else. She brings my walls down just by being near me--I am never as silly with anyone else or by myself as I am with her, she brings that out of me. It's only because of her that I've been able to honestly see myself (good and bad) and grow as a person. She's also an insanely generous person who has worked hard to also be confident/self-validating at the same time, and I am really proud of how much she invests in both of those qualities.	He is highly educated (terminal degree), in a very competitive stem field. He is the perfect candidate to be self-centered and arrogant. Yet... He cares about little things. He plugs my phone in when I forgot. He leaves medicine for me on the nightstand when he leaves for work before me and I was not feeling well the night before. He will gas up my car without telling me. He notices little things and he cares about those little things and it never ceases to humble me the time and attention and care he has for things other people might easily dismiss as inconsequential.
What are the best cookie recipes you have ever made?	Mash a few bananas, add some oats until thick but still all moistened, and then add whatever else you'd want in a cookie/oatmeal bar (I use dark chocolate chips, cinnamon, almonds, diced frozen blueberries, and some vanilla protein powder), and bake. You could form cookie shapes if you want, but I find it easier to just bake it in a large block across the tray and then cut it into squares.	The America’s Test Kitchen chocolate chip cookie made with browned butter. Gives the cookie a nice toffee flavor: https://theapronarchives.com/2011/05/08/americas-test-kitchen-perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies/ (A lot of America's Test Kitchen recipes are behind a membership wall/ paywall but you can always google she find a copy on a blog somewhere).
What do you think makes a woman "high" or "low" maintenance?	I hate high maintenance. The finer points being "low"...... ...not spending an hour getting ready to go out. ...if your outside at an event and it starts to rain, she doesnt complain about her hair getting wet, ruining her makeup, or running to hide in the car. ...being able to think for herself, and figure out her own life without handholding. ...not holding herself to stupid standards, like needing the newest purse, or only wearing certain brands.	It's about demands and personality traits that inconvenience/impact you. A low maintenance person will not inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. A high maintenance person will make it a point to inconvenience, burden, or impact their SO with their behavioral quirks or desires. The world revolves around high maintenance people in their mind and IT BETTER REVOLVE AROUND THEM IN YOUR MIND TOO OR ELSE! Pretend your SO is a vegetarian. A high maintenance SO will insist that you cannot have meat in the house nor eat meat in front of her nor be near her if you smell of it. A low maintenance SO will do none of that and will even go to a steakhouse with you so long as they have vegetarian selections.
Those who make a living in a creative field (art, music, writing etc.) what do you create and what does your work day look like?	I make my own porn for my website! Does that count? I get to direct and edit and write everything. It's a lot of fun. I got annoyed with never seeing porn I wanted to watch, so I try to make things towards a woman-centered audience.	I am a full-time Car Designer in Detroit! I am the only female designer on my team, so it's a very interesting work environment, but I basically get paid to draw cars all day! Most days consist of research, sketching on paper, digital painting of my designs, and working with clay and digital sculptors to turn my 2D drawings into 3D vehicle concepts. It's an amazing place to be, extremely competitive, but who can complain about getting to be creative all day surrounded by other insanely talented,passionate, creative people?!
It's National Coming Out Day in the USA! LGBTQA+ folk: Have you ever had a coming out experience? What was it like? Or if you are in the closet about a piece of your identity, care to talk about why?	I'm largely closeted as polyamorous, in that my family and work don't know. My close friends do, but many people just figure I don't date. I'm poly in that I've been dating guys in open relationships/marriages. It's not that I feel like *I* definitively need to be in poly relationships. I was successfully married and monogamous for almost two decades, after all.	I came out to my parents in a letter (I was 2000 miles away for college). On the same day they got the letter, my brother had a little accident with a chainsaw (it missed bones and tendons, but he has a nasty scar on his arm). My mom opened the letter after spending all day in the emergency room. She did not take it well. I think that will go down as one of the worst days of her life. Coming out to friends was a much better experience. A lot of them saw it coming and weren't surprised. For the most part, they were all really supportive.
Have you ever been "one of the girls?" How was it?	Of course. Some of my best friends are girls, and it's not unusual for me to be the only guy hanging out with a pile of girls on any given day. I find that the best place to get advice about girls is from girls, and I'm sure they're finding that the best place to get guy advice is from guys.	Yeah, pretty frequently. It gets awkward when they start talking about sex, though, because inevitably they look to me for a man's perspective, and I really don't have one to offer.
Have you ever noticed a difference between in the thinking or behavior between women who believe they are conventionally attractive vs not conventionally attractive?	In my experience, the majority of women in today's society see themselves as MUCH more attractive then they actually are. With this comes a sense of entitlement. I'd say the cause is social media and online dating sites. A 4+ can post a bikini picture online and no matter what, there will be thirsty guys slobbering all over the comment section in seconds.	The difference that I've seen is that the ones that KNOW they're attractive tend to take longer to develop interesting personalities. The ones that didn't KNOW or THINK they were attractive don't have this issue as much.
what was the final straw that made you realize a girl was just using you?	We were shopping together and she made me go back and return something i bought so she could get some goddamn laptop keyboard stickers.	When I realized that she didn't know a single thing about me, and it wasn't because I hadn't told her, it was because she hadn't listened to me or cared enough to remember what I said.
What is the moment you realized you were dating a keeper?	When I confided in him with my ROCD (a subset of Pure O), and he told me he wanted to help me work through it. We did, and much more quickly than I'd imagined! It had been a huge source of anxiety in the past, but he completely accepted me and put me at ease. I was so afraid of causing him pain with my doubts, but made me feel confident that wouldn't happen and I had to take a chance.	The night we "officially" started dating. We worked together and I was leaving my position. At this point we were just messing around, going for drinks every friday and promised each other "no feelings attached". That night we went to say good bye in the parking garage and both ended up crying our eyes out and saying I Love You for the first time. He gave me a gift to open when I got home (we thought we would never see each other again) and it was my favourite shirt of his, a bottle of the drink I had on our first work date together and the most beautiful card. Now we are 8 months away from our wedding day ❤
Be honest - if you are, what's the REAL reason you're still friends with your ex?	This isnt possible if the relationship was healthy and you genuinely had feelings for each other....if they're friends someone in the relationship was being used, or both were using each other.	Girlfriend and I in college were each other's first everything. We have long moved on with other partners and live in different parts of the country. She initiated contact a few years ago and we connect every six or eight months. What's the real reason? Hard to say.Maybe a link to when life was much simpler?
Men who currently date, or have dated a black girl, have you ever had problems from black men?	Lots of black women get angry at black men who date outside their race. The main two groups of people who have the highest percentage not in a relationship are black women and Asian men. So when a black guy, especially one with his life together goes outside of their race it's seen as being a race traitor.	Whitey here, been married to a black woman for 4 years. I can count the number of times she's been approached by a black man in front of me on one hand, and even fewer times did they mention my ethnicity. She's taller than me, that gets mentioned more often than our races. BTW White man/Black woman couples have the lowest divorce rate of any mixed ethnicity combo.
Ugly/unattractive women: what is your experience being the ugly friend?	Not a woman. Just my little two cents I was the shy kid when i was younger, had a hard time dealing with my stage fright and talking to people I didn't know. However, after getting over my fear of speaking to people I love making people smile, their appearances does not matter to me. I compliment everybody when possible, even something as little as "you have a great smile" can surely brighten up someone's day. I just want everybody to be awesome to each other ):	I don't consider myself unattractive but I have a best friend that's a smoke show. You get left talking to the nice wingman a lot and holding purses.
What happened this week that made you really happy?	Every week makes me happy, I love what I do and I have time and money for hobbies. Life's short I think we should all try make the most of it	This time last week, I was snuggling up with my long distance girlfriend and her cat. I'd say that made me pretty happy.
What’s the most offensive thing a woman has (Accidentally) asked you?	There’s no chance she was negging you? I’m sure after working out for three years you have some sort of visible muscles.	Had an older manager confused why so many women were interested me. Said I didn't seem like the sexual type.
Lesbians of AskWomen, how can you tell when another person is lesbian too?	I have a 100% track record for calling it (in my head) before someone explicitly tells me that they're queer. With other lesbians I think it's usually something in the posture and gait, plus the set of the jaw and head. Lesbians tend to stand more confidently than straight women, and you can see it if you're looking for it. Having noticed it a few times, it's now the biggest 'tell' for me. However, it fails me sometimes with very feminine girls, and girls who are queer but not gay. With bisexual girls especially, I'll go back and forth in my head debating if they are queer or not. Basically everyone I've not been able to tell with has identified as bi, pan or queer.	Honestly, there really isn't a clear way without them literally telling you. The fashion that used to be stereotypically lesbian is now much more common outside of the lesbian community, and more and more women are experimenting with the androgynous look. Even if they're wearing some sort of Pride accessory, it's impossible to know what part of the rainbow they are proud of.
**HOLY SHIT MOMENT** THIS is what it's supposed to be like. Have you had your HOLY SHIT moment &amp; what was it like for you?	Idk, I guess I haven't really had one of those, and I don't know if I believe everybody has "one".	My holy shit moment was at an intervention for my ex-husband. I was talking about the life we could have, and at every turn he had a counter argument about why it wasn't possible, why it was silly or unimportant. Finally, he gave his shut down statement: "Our life isn't that bad how it is. Things are ok." Then he told me he wouldn't be going to rehab. HOLY SHIT. Daily black out drinking, verbal/physical/psychological abuse, infidelity, never talking or spending time together... "isn't that bad"? I told him that I loved him, but that for me, it was "that bad." Then I walked out and never looked back.
What is the most romantic thing a partner has done for you, that might not have been intended to mean so much?	Even during a four year relationship. I don't believe I have had a romantic act directed towards me. It was always me to her. (Whomever she has been throughout my life. Short term partners or that four year relationship )	My wife has a strong belief in the concept of the nuclear family. Doesn’t like the idea of having our parents on either side live with us. That being said, my mom is really sick with cancer. She and I are really close. The other day after a particularly bad call with my mom (fluid filled lungs, etc), my wife told me we should set up our guest room for my parents once my mom’s current set of treatments is over. She knows how much my moms health and happiness means to me and is happily going to disrupt her life, especially during residency, because she knows how much peace of mind it will bring me. Maybe not typically romantic, but it was to me.
People who actively worked on themselves before getting into relationships, what did you do and achieve?	Inb4 "start lifting". That's bullshit. You can be a strong SOB, but if you have no ego, all you'll be is a strong weakling.	It's been 3 years since I've been in a relationship, and I'm working myself up to asking this girl out. We've been friends for about a year, but I've been getting hints from other friends that I should go for it. I really hope this works out because I know that this is what I want. I'm not the type of person to *know* what I want, but this I'm sure of. Edit: Thanks for the support guys!
Is it OK to ask a guy out at the gym? How would I even go about it?	>I've seen countless amount of posts from the women's perspective where they say things like "Uhgh, ick, being hit on at the gym." Are men women?	1. As you said, just make sure that he's done is set or run or whatever. 2. Then only chat him up, not 30 guys in a single day. 3. "Hi, I've seen your around, I'm ScopicView" [Hi, I'm DarkHorse] "I don't want to keep you from your workout, but I wanted to know if you'd join me for a [coffee/drink/kale smoothy] later" You'll either have a date or not.
There are two sides to every story. Why would your ex say you broke up?	Because he was an unhinged, bad boyfriend. There wasn't much else to understand about things. I am uncertain as to the reason of the downvotes - he *knew* those things to be true when I dumped him.	Because I was crazy and emotionally unstable. (Due to my partner being an alcoholic and refusing to go to AA.)
What rant have you been wanting to go on, but feel like you otherwise can't?	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
What do you think about women who are taller than you?	I've got no problem with a woman being taller. But in *almost all* circumstances a women will prefer a taller man. When you go online what is the NUMBER ONE thing a girl asks for on her dating profile... a *taller* man. Not a man with hair, not a man that doesn't smoke, not an intelligent man. A *taller* man. So this question is completely academic. Better go ask the girls "what do you think about men that are shorter than you".	Not even a negative for me, but often a dealbreaker for them. My girlfriend is four inches taller than I, and I was half-expecting it to be an issue for her. After a while, I just bought in that she wasn't bothered and didn't secretly prefer a taller man and that's that. It's fun. I'm a leg and ass man anyway.
Do men tend to stare at a woman's "crotch" area?	You are wearing leggings and tight jeans. That causes men to stare at your crotch. They look to see if they can see anything. A camel toe, lip shape, and hair bulge, anything. It is in from our DNA. We see a good looking female and we want to have sex with her. Immediately. Name, personality, and everything else about her doesn't matter. That is why when guys cheat on their wives or ex-girlfriend and say, "It meant nothing to me.", they are really telling the truth.	Unless there was a very obvious camel toe or something, I would say they are staring at your legs, ass, thigh gap, waist, and/or hips.
What is something about sex for men you wish females knew about but for some reason, they just don't know or understand?	Have sexy "after shower" clothes, seperate from "sleeping clothes". *come home from work, shower, put on something sexy, have sex if everyone is in the mood. This works especially when their are kids in the house and you can't get started right away. Put on something that he loves to see you in, but won't creep the kids out. Not lingerie, just not big baggy pjs. The pjs are for sleeping.	A penis doesn't come with an on/off switch. It doesn't get hard or soft on demand. If a guy can't get hard, it doesn't mean it's broken or that he doesn't like you. It a guy gets hard at an inopportune time, it doesn't mean he's doing it on purpose.
What is the worst misfortune that has befallen your vulva?	The tribulations of youth... Drunk in a field, and there was no bathroom. Wearing heels, I stumbled into the dark to take care of some business. Pants to ankles, crouched to the ground in a wobbly squat, I tipped over and thought "Fuck it, I'll just sit here and finish peeing." It wasn't until I went to pull up my pants that I realized the intense burn of the wrath of every member of the ant pile I had just pussy smashed as they bit my bits to bits. *Fuck* that sucked.	I got stung by a hornet who got in my panties while I was using the bathroom at my grandmas house. I was about to get married and we were working on our house next door. I was walking back to our house when it stung and I screamed and ran into our house and stripped off my pants in front of my mom stepdad and husband. All this and my mom still lectures me about taking pants off in front of husband!
What should you do when most of your friends are going nowhere in life?	Find new friends. It won't be the first or the last time you do it. You don't have to ghost them or anything like that, but you need to branch out and meet new people who have similar interests and drives as you. &#x200B; Never allow yourself to remain the smartest guy in a room for too long.	You will gradually grow apart over time. It's sad but that's life. But if they are not actively holding you back right now and you enjoy your time with them then I don't think you need to do anything. You could even be the positive example they need to kick it up a gear. But the second you feel like they're holding you back then you know it's time to put space in between you. Edit- Thanks for the gold :)
What should every man experience by the time he is 30?	* Having sex with a married woman * Moving somewhere with no safety net, no one to bail you out if you don't make that place home * Getting shot and surviving * Challenging the way things are at a job you could afford to lose, especially if you challenging that thing makes the company more efficient. * Live in a loft in a nice city, and throw a big party when you move out. * Travel cross country on a rode trip, or a greyhound (once is enough if you choose the greyhound route) * Travel alone, and don't plan anything before hand I'm sure I have more but these are just things from personal experience that will change and shape you, hopefully you learn the right lessons from all of them.	Travel alone once. It can seem daunting and lonely, but my solo trip to Thailand was so amazing. Even traveling with 1 other person, you have to take in account what they want to do, what they want to eat, but alone? You do whatever the fuck you want. Wanna stuff your face with local cuisine and then get a massage and pass the fuck out? Do it. Someone tells you about this cool island with little monkeys and crazy night parties? Go. Nothing holds you back except yourself. Also, meeting people at Hostels is so much fun, I never really felt lonely.
What is a societal norm you vehemently protest?	Becoming more and more of a norm, but I refuse to liken a pet to a child. To me, there are so many class implications with that one - when my crunchy, cute, hip friend calls her dog her "baby," and liken it to actual parenting, people think it's adorable, but if a homeless person did it, they'd be committed. Mostly, though, I just don't view pets as people.	Playing games with men. I've never done it, and I don't really know how to. I've never followed that 'Wait-X-Dates-Before-You-Fuck' rule, which always seemed a bit archaic like men are the only people who want to fuck and it's women's job to be a gatekeeper? But also that 'wait for him to text you' and 'wait for him to ask YOU out on a second date' never appealed to me, but it may also come across as creepy to dudes who are so into those societal expectations already.

what’s the cutest thing your girlfriend or wife does that the world should know about?	To the chucklefucks who think they’re clever commenting “she doesn’t exist,” she’s invisible” etc: we get it, you’re single. So is everyone else, it’s reddit for fucks sake. Get better material.

New girlfriend's abusive ex-boyfriend is threatening me, how do I go about this?	you grow a pair and knock him the fuck out! simple answer=man up or pay me 50 bucks and ill do it!	Keep records, report it to the police and attempt to get a restraining order for you and her. If you know your neighbors, give them a description of the guy and tell them to look out.
What are your thoughts on a girlfriend still hanging out with a couple she had threesomes with in the past?	Personally, I would break up w/ her on the spot, but that's me. Getting into a relationship is serious business and I have my criteria (not having an overly active sexual past being one of them). Looking from the outside, If everyone's ok w/ it, I wouldn't look down on it at all. Individual choices vary and affinities too.	My initial reaction? Discomfort - it is not something I've ever dealt with. Since it was an ongoing thing, my first thought is that she may be trying to gently introduce the idea of a swinger-type dynamic.
If you were going to restart your life at 33, how would you start the process?	If you haven't done anything towards your retirement, go at it full strength. Invest like crazy in whatever you are passionate about (Mine is real estate). Reinvest those profits. In my investments, it's not too difficult (with lots of planning, education, etc.), to double your investments worth in a few short years, AND still keep cash flowing.	The very first step clean your room this helps you organized, reduce your chances of getting sick, and the environment around you feels better.
What is the hottest non-sexual act a girl can do?	When they are not smoking a cigarette. Once they put up a cigarette I don't care how attractive they are, it's a No from me	State where she wants to eat with neither hesitation nor delay. In theory, at least, that would be hot AF.
If you were given one free pass to lose your shit on someone for anything, no matter how minor, how would you use it?	The harambe shit. Not the dicks out thing, your dick should be out for the rest of your life to remember that magical gorilla. I mean the angsty mourning. No one knew who harambe was before he was killed, acting like someone murdered your spouse for a laugh isn't going to bring him back and no, for fucks sake, you probably don't care about the gorilla more than its handlers did or have a better understanding of how to handle that situation.	My brother. He went awol from our family a couple of ywars ago and married this absolute cow of a woman. I'm not sure what was happening in his head but he called my parents and started abusing tbem over the phone. They hung up and didn't answer his calls anymore. He called again and left a message My mum played it for me and I nearly left then and there to kill him. He raved about how my dad was a spineless cunt and mum was a fat bitch, that my grandfather would roll over in his grave (my parents did nothing). He's been more than a fuckup his entire life, a million chances given and all of them fucked away. So if I had one shot, no consequences. I would tear out his fucking heart.
Whats something that as soon as someone says it, you stop taking them seriously?	Islam is a religion of peace. BULLSHIT! Buddhism is a religion of peace, islam is a religion of oppression and hate and throwing gay peeps off buildings.	When they act like they are always the victim, or drama just happens to follow them and has nothing to do with them specifically.
Married/committed women of /r/askwomen , What relationship advice do you have for every young man out there?	Be trustworthy. This doesn't only go for not telling lies, which is a given (seriously though, don't lie - if you get caught, even in a little lie, it destroys the confidence your S.O. has in you). But also, show up when you say you will. On time. If you say you'll do something, do it - don't just put it off then make up some excuse why you couldn't manage it. Some of the most important qualities I know I personally looked for in a partner were trustworthiness, dependability, reliability, etc. And it really actually hurts when someone can't ever seem to make good on the promises they give.	If you're having a disagreement, don't call names. You can put this into practice in any situation, but especially with your partner. Name calling doesn't help your argument; it only serves to hurt the other person unnecessarily, and potentially make you sound ignorant. I'm not even talking about swearing -- calling someone stupid or pathetic can be just as damaging. If it doesn't work towards solving the issue, it's not worth saying.
What are some downsides of being conventionally attractive?	One things that’s been a major downside is jealousy, especially when it comes from family members or your best friends. I’ve had a plate of food thrown in my hair, called a “hoe”, bullied and gossiped about, and got blamed for another person’s relationship issues. I hate the feeling of knowing someone is envious of me because of my looks. It’s NOT my fault that a man is attracted to me. I’m not doing anything to cause it except for just being myself. I’ll catch myself downplaying my looks sometimes. For example, I’ll make self-depreciating jokes like, “oh it’s all make up” or “I’m not that thin lol”. Like, it sucks because I have great self esteem but I hate knowing someone feels bad about themselves because of me	People assume you aren’t smart. People assume you don’t have to work hard. People assume you like hearing things about your looks all the time. People don’t take the time to get to know you. People assume you’re shallow. People assume you’re judging other people by their looks.
How long would you date a girl before asking her to be your girlfriend?	What I want to figure out. Is why you call it dating if you aren't bf and gf? Because at that point that's not dating. That's called being friends.	Depends where you are I'm guessing. I'm here in Ireland, and after the first date, if it goes well, you'll find yourself just spending days with them and then you realize you're totally in a relationship. Of course I may be speaking from minority, I truly don't know, but from what I've seen, the whole multiple dates to judge a person thing, seems to be a US setup.
Do you have any turn-offs that make you feel bad for having them?	anything dealing with gay/bi guys I know lots of girls think two dudes having sex is hot, but I'm always repulsed by the thought. and not in an "ohh, how taboo" way -- a "kill me now" way. kinda makes me feel like a bigot	Bad grammar/spelling. I feel bad about it because it seems so elitist and dumb to be hung up on something like this, but it's just so distracting (especially when 90% of my interactions with people are online or via text). I type in complete sentences/thoughts and they need to do the same or else my head is just going to hurt for the entire conversation.
What are your worst failures in the bedroom/during sex?	Had trouble getting hard during my first time. Only managed to get half erect despite my best efforts. She must be going around thinking I'm actually only 5 inches -.- EDIT: Ok, to whoever downvoted me. I didn't mean to imply that 5 inches is short :/	Moaned my own name out loud. Was turned on at the thought of her doing it, but i kinda thought out loud.
Why does it appear that many parents were much more successful than their adult children of the same age?	At 23 your parents parents said the same thing to them. And their parents the same, etc etc. However, whining about it certainly makes you come off less adultish.	Simply because things were easier for them back then. My grandad was a engineer for Rolls Royce, he got the job simply by walking up to the factory and asking if he could have a job, and they gave him a low end job which he then worked his way up from... These days grades seemingly mean everything, although my current job is very well paid and I wasn't even asked if I could spell my name.
Ladies, what are your short girl problems?	I'm 5'4 (163cm). I don't think of myself as a very short woman, but hugging and kissing my 6'4 SO sometimes hurts my neck (and of course, I often stand on tiptoes). He has a mirror in his bathroom that is too high and I can only see my eyes. Also, sometimes I can't reach products at a grocery store. And finding the perfect pair of jeans/pants is almost impossible. Edit: I work as a physiotherapist and when I have tall men as patients, I feel really weird standing next to them or behind them, because I'm so small compared to them and I get the feeling that they won't take me seriously.	5'3 here. Going to shows and concerts is definitely the worst. Without fail, there's always that dude that pushes his way in front of me, blocking out that window of space between other people's heads that I so carefully positioned myself in to see. I hate that guy.
Does anyone else feel like they are constantly buying clothes but still feel like they don't have anything to wear? What am I doing wrong in my shopping?	Please consider buying your clothes second hand so that you won't contribute to the slave-labor-reliant fashion industry. Edit: To everyone downvoting me, I urge you to watch The True Cost and see how it changes your life.	Don't impulse-buy. Go shopping only when you need something and have a list of what you need, i.e. I want a maxi dress, ankle pants for work, and a couple work-appropriate short sleeve shirts. Buy pieces that work with multiple outfits. Take inventory of what you have at home before you go shopping. Accessorize! I used to be bad at this, but I'm getting better. A scarf, necklace, belt, etc. can change a whole outfit. Clean out your closet a couple times a year (I do this in the Spring and Fall). If you haven't worn it in the last year, get rid of it! Unless, of course, it's a special occasion dress or something. Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes you never know what will look good together until you try it on! Mix and match what you already have!
Men of Reddit, is the male posturing between father and boyfriend a real thing? What was your best or worst story of meeting the dad?	no its not.....im black i date mostly white women, never had a dad act weird towards me, so if they are fine with me they are fine with the white guy that came before or after me	My date for homecoming (in the sticks of Georgia) came out and met me with a baseball bat. That was pretty awkward. My current girlfriend's dad is a gun collector. For the first few months of dating her, he had a habit of checking his ammo whenever I came in the house. Nothing like the click of a magazine being loaded into a pistol to welcome you to a house. It's a real thing. I always take it as sort of a joke rather than an actual attempt to intimidate, though. It's a sort of stereotype and if I was the father in that situation, I might have a little fun with it
Ladies, what is the best and/or worst response you've received when making the first move?	I invited a guy over when my dad was out of town (I was about 16) and had 2 friends over as well. The dude and I had been talking for awhile and I figured this was the perfect time to "get" with him. He comes over, we're in my room, things start to happen, and then he just stops. I asks what's wrong, he says "I can only have sex with girls I really care about". Wow, ok, well that's fine I guess, we'll just hang out. He leaves my room and sees that my dad has the computer game he likes. He says "OMG you have Farcry? Is it cool if I play?" Basically he came over under the pretense of sex, ended up playing on my dad's computer all night. :(	Tried to kiss him, he moved coz he thought I was going to tell him something (we were somewhere very loud), ended up kissing his ear! It went no further
Since joining reddit, how has it changed you, for better or for worse?	I got some perspective, but also exposure to some rather nasty people. take the good with the bad, i guess	It's given me access to many different perspectives that I'd probably never get to hear otherwise. On the other hand, it's made me hate people more because of it.
How do you stay interesting as an adult?	Drop the video games. Nobody ever gets to the end of their lives and says, "I wish I had played more video games." Travel, volunteer, get outside, find an activity you enjoy and dive into it, join a club, learn an instrument, learn a language, take a course, learn a new skill. Get out there and live life. It's an amazing thing.	One of the best things of getting older is that you run out of fucks to give about whether other people will find you interesting or not. As long as *you're* not bored with whatever it is you're doing - it's really kind of irrelevant how other people feel about it.
What happens at a girls night?	**Standard fake answer:** Sacrificing the blood of the innocent; checking in with the global woman consortium; witchcraft; pillow fights. **Actual answer cos you seem genuine:** Wine; movies; gossip; makeovers; bad food. **Clothes to wear:** Something comfy if you're not planning on going to bars/clubs/town **Things to bring:** Delicious snacks and tasty booze	**Standard fake answer:** Sacrificing the blood of the innocent; checking in with the global woman consortium; witchcraft; pillow fights. **Actual answer cos you seem genuine:** Wine; movies; gossip; makeovers; bad food. **Clothes to wear:** Something comfy if you're not planning on going to bars/clubs/town **Things to bring:** Delicious snacks and tasty booze
Is it right to monitor your child's full online history?	It's not only right, it's your *responsibility* to monitor your child's online activities. When they get around 14 or so, you can talk about *some* privacy (like with personal messages). You also need to have safeguards on any computer your kids are using, and you need to have occasional talks about being online and what is acceptable, and what is unacceptable. Then, you need to actually follow through and check up on them once in a while. If you just sit your kid down in front of a computer and let them do and see whatever they want, you're gonna have a bad time. The most important thing is to stay connected ... to your own kid. Talk to them, *listen* to them, actually *be* a parent, not a baby-sitter.	I don't know if it's "right" but I do know that I have some major psychological issues around trust as a result of my parents reading my chat logs, internet histories, and journals when I was in the 10-15 age range. I'm sure that there are times when that kind of breech of trust is justified, but in my case, I was smart and never got myself into any trouble that would justify them snooping like that - so the only result was that I got very angry with them and had trouble trusting them thereafter.
Do women use reddit to look at men?	I subscribed to r/massivecock for a while, but then unsubscribed because I sometimes go on reddit when the kid's around. Not sure how much of a representative sample I am, though.	In a sense, I do. I'm subbed to /r/Ladybonersgonecuddly and /r/LadyBoners so I guess look at dudes when they come up on my front page. And sometimes I browse porny subs that have dudes in them. But that's not the primary reason I use Reddit. It's more incidental.
Aside from the gates of Hell opening, how does your period affect you?	It seems that about two or three days into my period, I start feeling really really really sick, way worse than any stomach bug I've ever had. I have no idea why this happens. It started happening very suddenly a bit over a year ago. Birth control is the only thing that keeps it at bay.	I get RIDICULOUSLY horny the day before/of and will do literally nothing but masturbate all day between bathroom breaks and if food is brought to me in bed. During the three days I have it I maintain a bit of that horniness to a lesser degree and have mild cramps. I also experience emotions 2fold which I find annoying.
What is something in life that never lived up to the hype for you as much as it seems to for everyone else?	Any kind of interpersonal relationships. Sex was the worst thing ever, kissing was horrible, even just casually spending time with other people is solidly meh. Like, people enjoy others? And don't feel like that's a burden? Sounds fake.	High school. I heard a lot that it's supposed to be some great, responsibility-free fun time in your life with parties and friends for life and fun. I was glad to get out of there.
Guys, what's a sickeningly cutesy thing you do in regards to your SO, but wouldn't ever admit to for fear of seeming clingy?	When my wife isn't home, I masturbate to her pictures. It's like having sex with her, but she doesn't even know....	Bought a tiny dictionary and circled every nice word in it. Then wrote "what you mean to me" on the cover and gifted it to my girlfriend. Been married to her for 8 years now.
Oh God, I'm rewatching Sex &amp; the City and I hate them all. What shows, movies, books etc disappointed you the second time around?	Firefly. I mean, the "Chinese" was pretty bad on first watch, but then everything that's fundamentally not right with the series (basically no Asians, the poor treatment of Inara and "whores") is really apparent.	When I was packing away my childhood books for my move a few years back, I decided to re-read some of the big series titles that I'd collected. *The Baby-Sitters Club* and *The Boxcar Children* - I couldn't even get through them with a straight face because who the heck has such freakishly well behaved and trustworthy kids? *The Animorphs*, on the other hand, held up fairly well. I actually appreciated the story more as an adult than when I was younger. Even if the actual writing style is super simple, it touches on a lot of difficult and complex issues and doesn't glorify the whole getting super powers to fight a war thing.
Women who have/had violent fathers, how do you think this has effected your relationships with men, particularly romantic relationships?	I don’t think it affected me at all tbh. I don’t like assholes. If a guy is rude or loud I stay away from them because they’re unpleasant. I don’t like when guys get loud in general. When my boyfriend screams at his video games (the only time he ever yells) it makes me jump and get panic-y and a little angry too.	I'm afraid of them. Honestly, I don't trust them easily. I'm aware that the fear is irrational but it's lead to me being distant and cold to men. Especially whenever a man takes in interest in me. I wish I wasn't like this, because I've ruined a lot of would be relationships because of how cold I can be. I hate that I've hurt their feelings; I just doing know how to deal with men.
Internet friends, what "uncomfortable realities" in your life have you become resigned to?	I'll never earn a livable income. I only have a GED and while I like my factory job, costs of living are going to increase faster than my pay. I could never in a million years afford to be on my own (thankfully I live with my boyfriend and we share bills), I'll never afford a house or anything. My nicest possession is my car, and even that I had to finance for 6 years. I really couldn't care less about college and I don't care to have a ~real job~ in an office or something, I just want to make enough money to live. But I don't and I never will.	I will never have a normal relationship with my mother. I'm 25 and still afraid of "getting in trouble". I don't know how it keeps happening- I'll think I've figured it out and then she pulls me back in. Logically I know I'm an adult, and that her opinion no longer matters, but in the back of my mind all I want is for her to be happy with my life. I don't even care if I'm happy with it. As long as everyone else is satisfied, I feel like I'd feel okay. But I'm so constantly afraid of hurting or upsetting the people I love that it kills me when I mess up (which I always do) and I'm constantly terrified I'll wake up and have nobody left.
(NSFW) Last night I inhaled my septum ring while having sex with an ex. What are some of your awkward sex stories?	My boyfriend just loves eating me from behind. Even after two Valentine's Day ago- when he pulled back and his big nose was covered in shit from digging in my caboose! He's not usually a brown noser... At least he better not be!	Had a 'one night stand' and he was a virgin. His penis was too small for the condom and he came within 20 seconds. I tried to tell him it was okay but he cried.
Not meaning to offend here, but do you sometimes feel that people on Reddit can be quite snobby when it comes down to where you are in life?	This is not unique to Reddit. People in general are judgmental as fuck. I have my life decisions questioned all the time despite having a good job (pays above average for my age), hobbies I enjoy, physically active/fit etc... I'm a happy, pleasant person, but not living by some other person's standards makes them treat me as some kind of failure.	Honestly, Reddit tends to be a judgy as fuck place in general, and I don't think a lot of the popular opinions/circlejerks on this site are very representative of how most people think/behave in real life. I wouldn't take it too personally. If you're content and living well by your own standards, fuck everyone else.
Guys old enough to remember the years before the infinite streaming porn of today: how would you describe it to those who aren't old enough to remember them?	We had to actually interact with women and girls in the context of their being...you know...human beings worthy of respect.	When I turned 18, I got memberships to all the local video stores. Daisy chained two vcrs together so I could record the adult movies onto one 6 hr vhs tape. Had to hide it from my parents. At one point, I placed it inside a Tupperware container and buried it in the backyard to keep my parents from finding it.
Anyone have stories about dating "red pill" men?	I haven't dated anyone who subscribed they're but I could definitely see an ex or two of mine subscribing now. I've had a free college guys try some PUA stuff on me and usually it just makes me laugh at them.	Went out with one. I posted the really bizarre story of this in another thread. But as for the pure redpill behavior, he couldn't decide whether he wanted to neg me all night, or desperately seek my comfort and nurturing when talking about his personal problems. Like he'd be talking about his parents being distant and then rebound with 'Why do you walk so weird, what's wrong with your leg?'. He preached about how true masculinity was his new goal in life, and got into an argument with me about whether PUA tactics actually work (after using them on me with no success). He yelled over me to explain it's just for ''stuck up bitches with their heads so far up their ass they won't give you the time of day''. Then ''Oh shit, I wasn't talking about you, you're not like the other girls, don't be mad''.
Men who went from receiving zero attention from the opposite gender to doing decently well, what steps did you take to improve your situation?	Got rich. And figured out it’s a numbers game. You talk to 10 girls, 1-3 on a good day might respond positively. Talk to 100 girls, that’s 10-30 who might respond positively. Being in shape and funny really helps to, and haveing a big dick is icing on the cake. And if they say no or make fun of you who cares? Best they says yes, worse they say is no. It’s not like your gonna get aids by getting turned down lol	* Shaved my head. Balding looks ugly, being bald is a look. * Lost fat. I've just slowly gotten leaner over my adult life * Gained muscle. Nearly a decade in the military helped here but I'm fairly big for a non lifter * Got older. 20 year old girls want a certain type, 30 year old women want a different type. I've always been more of the latter so age has done wonders for me. * Dated a really hot chick for nearly a year. This does wonders for your confidence, self image, etc. * Got diagnosed with cancer. This might sound odd but it did wonders for mentally. My entire outlook on life is changed. I'm happier, I live a fuller life, etc. I don't even need to say anything about cancer, it's just my life choices now make me more attractive.
What’s the angriest you’ve been at a dude and why?	When my best friend of 10+ years confessed to me that he thought it was cool to snort some coke. I was really fucking pissed.	This guy and I had been good friends for about six years. At one point he started going through a rough time and I frequently helped him out with various things, but mostly financially and with childcare. Then one day he ghosted me completely out of nowhere. Deleted me off social media and stopped texting and everything. To this day I have no idea what the fuck even happened. All I know is that he owes me a lot of money.
Do I need to specify I'm asking you out on a date?	you can always end with "great, it's a date" when she agrees. that will get the message across in a less blatantly obvious way.	Depends on the context. If you are friends and regularly hang out with this person in non-date situations, then you should probably say that it is a date. If you met on an online dating site, everyone probably knows that it's a date.
When did you first realize women saw you as a potential mate?	About your update: Unless the guy in question is extremely attractive chances are that you won't get compliments, won't be hit on, that any display of sexuality or any advances are deemed creepy. Add to that the usualy shaming of the male sex drive (= rape drive according to some) and I can't see any reason why a man would think of himself as sexually attractive. On a certain level I know that some women may see me as attractive or sexy, but I can't say that NOT thinking this would be dumb or naive, as it's a legit conclusion given the information boys and men get.	Never. I might be alone in this. But dating for me is convincing someone who has no interest in me as a potential mate that they should reconsider what I have to offer. I instigate 100% of the time.
What's a common piece of advice on Reddit that you think hurts people more than it helps?	Lose weight. You'll be happier. Edit: I've just noticed that Reddit seems to be exceedingly fat phobic. Instead of highlighting healthy lifestyles, people on here attack anyone who doesn't fit their idea of attractive.	I really hate the armchair diagnostics. Personality disorders in particular get thrown around like confetti under the criteria of "this person seems sucky from your description." This works towards increasing the stigma of these, which in turn makes seeking and getting treatment harder. It makes people associate disorders with only assholes and writes them all off as if no one does seek treatment for them. Unless you are medically caring for someone, stop diagnosing. If the OP has things that indicate an issue that might need treatment, guide them to seek that. If someone is describing someone and that person seems awful, use that or some synonyms, not a medical diagnoses. A medical diagnoses is not a damn adjective.
How much alcohol do you drink in a week?	My wife and I go through quite a bit of vodka. We are semi dependent and acknowledge it. We work so much and our lives are so crazy at this age we don't mind it being a bit of a crutch in the evenings to wind down. We plan to slow down when ready for children.	0\. Don't drink at all and my family never really did during the week or at all to be honest.
"All my guy friends constantly bust each others balls. It's a sign of affection. The more a guy likes you as a friend, the more comfortable he is to give you a hard time. Guys are excessively formal and polite around guys they don't trust." Do you feel like this is in any way true?	I am not okay with that and I don't want friends who try to "bust my balls" all the time. I want supportive friends who don't use my misfortune or mistake as some subject of entertainment. My friends don't banter by putting each other down, often we banter by waxing poetic about how mind blowingly awesome the other is. Or we just hijack some minor absurd statement and see how far we can exaggerate it out of reality. There's all sorts of banter that isn't at someone's expense. I do not understand why insulting each other is considered normal in friendships. It's not for me and if you don't like it either then just know that you're not alone.	Assuming we are not talking about a work environment (as many people want to keep a work environment professional regardless), yes. The difference between friendly banter and disrespect once there is a relationship established, is the choice of what buttons that are pushed. Friends don't pick on the things that actually upset you, unsettle you, or make you look bad in front of others, and if they accidentally do they apologize for it. Friends pick on the things that you can make fun of in a lighthearted way. My breakup isn't very funny or appropriate to bring up in front of others. The time I borrowed a bicycle, didn't realize the rear brake wasn't connected, braked hard at the bottom of the hill and went right over the handlebars, is funny to harass me about. Especially if we're biking and there's a hill coming up.
Men of reddit, is it universally known that when first dating someone, exclusivity is not common?	Yes, not exclusive until discussed. My GF of 5 years thought we were exclusive from date #1....nope. I saw other women for the first several months.	there is no universal standard. common dating practices are often regional. in some places, people are expected to *only* date exclusively. in others, exclusivity is only expected after a relationship becomes "serious." where sex falls in that also varies a lot.
What is an immature or unrealistic relationship expectation that you've encountered or think is too common in today's society?	That a man has to pay for everything. In today's day and age that's absolutely ridiculous to expect but so many women look to find men who will 'rescue' them.	The expectation that you will just meet someone perfect for you despite not putting any time or effort into meeting new people. I have a few single friends who just seem to think a partner will fall into their laps one day and they don't need to do any of the pursuing.
Can you rely on your SO if you're in danger?	Yeah. We're both heavily armed and rehearsed, so as much can be planned for, we're pretty ~~vigilant~~ paranoid about. Our house is set up in such a way that a break in would be bad news for the intruder	My ex used to insist on sleeping on the side of the bed closest to the door in case somebody broke in. But I think it's one of those situations where you won't really know until you're in that situation. I imagine that dude didn't *plan* on running, but that fight or flight instinct can *make people do uncharacteristic things* sometimes.
What career did you want to have when you were younger? Did you achieve this?	I wanted to be a nurse cuz that's what my mom was and then I realized what a terrible job that is (for me, not disrespect to the ppl who do it, you are much needed).	I wanted to be America’s Next Top Model. In second grade, I realized I was probably going to be too short for that, so I decided to study engineering!
Ladies of Reddit, what's a douchey thing that guys do but we don't realize we are doing it?	Singing 'girly' karaoke songs as a joke. It's not funny when women sing songs written by men and it's sexist and "douchey" to think it's funny in reverse. "So I put my hands up they're playing my song"	Complimenting me by putting down other women. Especially if it's by putting down *all other women*. Dude I can guarantee that I am not the ONLY woman who [anything].
Women of reddit, if your partner "stealthed" a condom off during sex how would you react? Has it ever happened to you or someone you know?	Doesn't that count as rape in some places? I'm aware that it does open up a can of worms about other things eg if women try lying that they're on birth control. I dunno how that would be categorised. Especially as mistakes happen, with condoms and with birth control. Even perfect use doesn't guarantee a perfect result. So how do you prove anything either way? No one that I know has done this, thank goodness.	I. Was. Pissed. At the time, I didn’t know it was the name for it. We weren’t seeing one another exclusively, we weren’t “dating”. He just slipped it off right st the end, it happened so fast. I got out of bed, (my bed) and stepped on it. And I didn’t say anything. He got up, got dressed and I walked him to the door & I said: “Oh, that thing where you take the condom off at the last second? Don’t fucking do that.” And I never heard from him again.
[Serious] What is a stereotype/misconception that you have to deal with on a regular basis that really pisses you off?	I can't do anything nice for a female without it being sexist or because I want to get laid. I am an asshole simply because I don't care to make small talk (meaningless conversation) just to talk to someone. If you want to converse, pick a topic. I am not here to entertain you just so you can fuck off at work. I'm either gay or something is wrong with me because I can't fathom why someone would want to put up with a female in their life. I am sorry I don't see the benefit of someone nagging or bitching about meaningless shit. Yes, there are women that don't do these things however I have yet to see a relationship where that is true.	Black guy here. * Can't dance. * Can't sing. * Can't rap * Can't play basketball * Am not hood. * Am not "Stephon Urk-el" Someone please tell my co-worker that. It's starting to get annoying.
As a guy who gets easily attached, how would you recommend navigating a dating world where who ever cares least wins?	There's your problem. You've been single for two years, now you're desperate. It's not that you don't want flings, you prob couldn't even get em if you tried. What you're trying to do is lock down the first chick that shows interest in you because you put them on a pedestal. ask yourself this: would you still wanna be with just one girl if sex was taken out of the equation? what you need is an abundance mentality.	Be you! Care! Yes it won’t work for a lot of people but those people aren’t meant for you anyways. My husband was very clear that he was very into me and had no issue moving things forward and defining our relationship at a healthy pace. His transparency and honesty put me at ease and really made me trust him. He’s still my best friend and favorite person in the world and I trust him 100%. Don’t try to conform to what you think you’re supposed to be. Just be you and be patient to wait for someone who appreciates the real you!
Women with toxic, neglectful mothers, how did you learn to cope with your poor relationship with your mom? How did it change how you viewed women in general? Did it change which women you let into your life?	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
Where do you live, how much do you pay in rent, and how much space do you get for what you pay?	I live in a middle class "ethnic" neighborhood in Queens. I pay $1700 for a 800 square foot one bedroom. I moved there with my ex-fiance, he since moved out. It's more than I need, but I can afford it, it's rent stabilized, and moving is a pain in the ass.	Currently in Tennessee, my boyfriend and a friend of ours are all renting a 3br/2ba duplex for $650, so around $220 a piece. It's not terribly big, but it's enough space for the three of us and after looking around at other rental options in my area, what we've got is a damn good deal.
For those of you who grew up with a single mom or without a male presence in your life, in what ways do you think you are "different" than the average guy?	Honestly? Not in a positive fashion, but that's mostly who they were, they were not, by definition, bad people, I just noticed certain things people did in a colder light as I grew up, I was usually incredibly doubtful of anything said that didn't hold up well in my books and in social situations I end up considering it as a lie on the spot.	My brother and I were raised by my mother. Although my father was involved, he lived elsewhere. I saw him every other weekend or so. Being raised in the way that I was made my standards for a romantic partner quite a bit higher than most people's. My mother managed to raise my brother and i without being dependent on anyone, and she's a former gang banger, so she wasn't weepy and emotional. I expect women to be emotionally resilient and independent...I cannot date someone needy or overly sensitive..it just comes off as childish, because my mom and grandma are some of the strongest people I know. If my grandma could survive and leave an abusive marriage and raise my mom, who raised two men alone in abject poverty, I have zero emotional bandwidth for you crying because I left the toilet seat up or went somewhere without you.
Did you ever feel honestly desired? If yes what made you feel so?	Money, looks, and personality get you laid. In that order. Women desire what you can do for them. Don't fill your head with romantic nonsense.	Having a hot tinder girl message me for a booty call was an ego boost and a half Didnt go though cos it was 3:30 am and my phone pinging woke me up before work the next day
Men of Reddit, are blue balls a real thing?	They're real in the sense that it's slightly uncomfortable, but usually when I hear about them it's in the context of someone being nagged & guilted into sex, so I'm kinda jaded about it.	I'm only piling on, because dear god they hurt. Yes, it's a real problem. It's like having a headache in your nuts.
What interesting sexual habits did you came across when you were in a relationship?	Way more subs than doms. Especially among men. It is true for both sexes. But with men it seems like 90% women like 80%. Assuming that they are into it at all. Not general population. Edit I made a mistake my bad I won't change it since it makes people laugh. My point is of people into bdsm. The overwhelming majority of both sexes are submissive. Huge shortage of doms, I do not know why.	My boyfriend now loves when I wear my aprons in the kitchen. Sometimes if I want to get laid, I wear my really feminine girl dress, throw an apron on and have dinner for him when he comes home. Often times, dinner is cold by the time we get to it. I have many aprons now.
This shirt is more sheer than I realized and I'm only halfway through the work day. What's your most recent wardrobe mess up?	I once shook the hand of the President of the United States wearing Superman boxer shorts. Totally slayed it. Edit: under my suit!. Perverts!	My first shift as a waitress I was wearing a really tight skirt with tights on underneath and knickers on top of the tights to hold them up (trust me it's genius). For like an hour the skirt, having ridden up, was around my waist and I was just walking around with my Superman-style get up on for all to see - I didn't notice because I had an apron/pinny thing on so it wasn't noticeable from the front. The restaurant was managed by my stepbrother, I was dating one of the chefs, and was very close friends with a waitress, and not one of those fuckers was brave enough to tell me my arse was hanging out. I literally only found out when I went outside to serve in the beer garden and felt the breeze on my little lady.
Men who didn't start dating until later in life, how did things turn out?	If you make good money, that's all that matters. Use that degree to make money, then you can advertise yourself on a dating website or something. If you have the means to provide a good life, you'll find a woman.	I had gone on a small collection of accidates and ill-informed dates, but my first proper date, where we both knew it was a date prior, happened at 24. That was 10 years ago. I've made some missteps, but taking a good amount of time to really get into helped me observe other people's relationships and decide what qualities I did and didn't want in mine. Go into dating because you want to. Not because "It's time", and not to "correct" the fact that you've not had a relationship.
Ladies who are/have been babysitters, what are your tips, tricks and advice?	Best babysitting advice I ever got- if the kids are old enough to walk and talk, ask them for a tour of the house first thing. This gives you an idea of what's important to them, makes them feel like you are their friend, and bonus- you get the tour.	Know CPR for kids. Ask about any allergies the kids might have. Make sure you know any routines (dinner, bath, bed, etc.) so the kids can't con you into staying up late or something. Give them things to do so they don't drive you crazy.
What's the weirdest "woman-y" thing to happen to you?	These comments are making me feel better about my period. I have fibroid tumors on my uterus and bleed heavily as a result. I have also expelled gigantic clots that flop onto the floor or off the side of the toilet or unknowingly on my leg and I don't know it until I pull my pants back on and feel a sticky wet glob somewhere where it shouldn't be. Also, the natural disasters in my pants when I happen to sneeze, cough, laugh, or just stand up after sitting a while. I'm always impressed with the really, REALLY big clots, though. It's a weird feeling of WTF coupled with pride.	One time I was putting on mascara and I got a sneeze that I wasn't expecting, and poked my eye with the wand, got the mascara all over my brow bone, and felt a clot squish out all at the same time. It was a mess.
When do you cut people out of your life?	When they bwcome douchebags with MY work or private life. I am very fine with them being terrible people, I know how ti handle it on a daily basis with diplomacy. But don t even TRY it with me.	When I don't like them anymore. When I feel the friendship is only one sided. When hanging out with these people feels more like an obligation. When I feel remaining friends makes me "sick" and unhappy.
Men who have been baby trapped by women how do you handle the situation?	Trapped meaning you are half responsible for the creation of a person and now have to co parent or financially support the dude?	When I busted my ex cheating (again), and broke up with her, I saw this desperation in her eyes, and they darted around the room as she thought for a solution. Suddenly she looked up at me and said, "Let's get married, let's have a baby" with a look on her face as if she had solved the problem of me getting rid of her. When she said that, an image of me in a cage popped into my head. I didn't think about it, it popped in as soon as she said it. Conversation was over, I told her to leave.

Ladies: What is your beauty "hack"?	Using good skincare. Not drugstore brands, actual professional products. Makes all the difference. Worth the investment especially if you wear makeup on a regular basis. I switched to Eminence Organic Skin Care and I'll never go back. And also coconut oil. Awesome for a deep conditioner, body moisturizer, oil pulling (in your mouth), eye makeup remover etc etc!!!	My hair is naturally wavy but every time I let it air dry it would just get frizzy and wild. I learned that when I pat my hair dry with a towel it causes the frizz. So now I use an old t-shirt to help soak up the extra water..... no more frizz! Just pretty beach wavy hair. Something about the fabric of a t-shirt being less rough and harsh than a bath towel.
What is your ultimate, PG-rated romantic fantasy?	I would love for my SO to choose a nice dress for me while on a vacation in Florence or somewhere in Italy (I’ve always dreamt of going there) and then getting ready and going whine tasting with fancy music in the background and an awesome view of the vineyards in front of us. As the sun sets with live music, we begin to slow dance all night until we get tired. Then we get back to our hotel room and there are candles lit everywhere with rose pedals on the floor. And as I am in awe of the beauty surrounding us, I turn around to find him bent on one knee asking me to be his for the rest of his life..... ahhhh one can only dream ☺️🌸💖	Hanging out with my SO in a log cabin, light snow outside, snuggled up by the fireplace in thick blankets. We'd have some wine, cheese and a charcuterie board to share and we'd eat sitting on the floor.
What is the best or worst thing you have overheard someone say about you?	The best thing my kids told me was that I am an awesome mother and my husband told me that I am the love of his life.	Best: that I make people feel at home 😊 Worst: that I had gained weight and was weighing my car down. Kinda funny, but still hurt my feelings.
Women who pick the bathroom stall right next to one that is occupied when there are others available, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?	Right? Everyone's asking why you care but it has nothing to do with being shy or ashamed...it's about choosing to go to the bathroom 6 inches away from someone in the same room when you could have gone further away...Good for you that you're comfortable with the fact everyone shits. Now be courteous and go away.	I tend to just grab the first one that I come to that isn't gross. Whether or not someone is in adjacent stalls doesn't even factor into it.
I love watching Cameron Diaz shop for groceries while drinking wine in The Holiday. What insignificant movie scene is your favorite?	In Annie Hall, when Woody and Diane Keaton are sitting in a park in NYC and he's making up hilarious imaginary lives for the people who are walking past them.	The "I'll show you how valuable Elle Woods can be" montage scene from Legally Blonde. Nothing can get me as pumped and ready to kick ass on an exam/paper as that one scene.
That 'fuck, women have crazy good handwriting' feeling, which typical male behavior do you silently admire?	One thing many men I've known have had that I am utterly lacking is this seemingly magical awareness of what direction they're facing or driving in, no matter what. It's one thing when we're in our small town, much of which is on a grid, which I can figure out, but when we're somewhere else that required twists and turns and possibly flights to get to? I just don't get it. My cursive rules, though. ;)	How "getting ready" can be as simple as rolling out of bed, sliding on jeans, any available t shirt, and shoes. No checking in a mirror. My boyfriend does this and somehow looks normal and ready to go. Me following these same steps, I look like a drowned rat.
Men, when did you realize the girl you were interested in wasn't for you?	I just wanted her to shut her dumb mouth. them I realized that while my feelings for her were real they were more about just being in a relationship for the first time then anything about her. so I did what an adult does in a two month relationship and stopped answering when she called.	When we'd been together a year and she hadn't opened up even a little. It was like being in love with a brick wall.
I [22F] am Muslim and have become friends with [26M] Catholic man at work. In spite of everything, I want more, what can I do to get closure after letting him know?	So, let me get this straight... God/Allah creates people. Creates love. Let's love happen between two people, then would say "no" because you two like the same book from different authors? I think he'll understand.	Can you explain a little more about how conservative/liberal you are in your belief structure? There's so many nuances here. I have some fairly liberal Muslim friends, and this wouldn't be an issue at all, but I know if you're a bit more conservative it would be. Are you specifically not allowed to date outside your religion?
I'm in a car with 4 girls singing 2000s Shakira at the tops of their lungs- when was the last time you wanted to barrel roll out of a moving vehicle?	I don't smoke but my friends do. It's nbd most times and I was with them while they were blunt cruising. These fuckers smoked high grade hash and then high grade weed. Then they played deadmau5 with the system BOOMING. I fucking melted in the back seat and felt the bass ripple through me with every hit. Mars was wonderful	I had a trio of friends that were drunk and pissed off a cabby in DC by being drunk idiots. One of them, being a drunk idiot, had the brilliant idea of barrel rolling out of a moving car. He ended up in the ICU for awhile and now has a plate on his skull. Just, you know, helping you determine cost/benefit.
Are any men actually attracted to belly button piercings?	What do you mean "actually"? I get compliments for mine all the time... And I am far from trashy, and I do not hangout with what society deems to be "trashy".	I don't hate them, but I also don't care for them. I wouldn't reject someone for having one, but at the same time, a belly button piercing would not make me more attracted to someone.
What cosmetic surgery did you have done, and after everything was said and done was it worth it for you?	I had Ulthera after a horrible illness left me suddenly looking older. So so worth it and no down time. Fuck ablative procedures. They make you look fake.	I was eighteen when I had surgery on my eyes to "fix" my lazy eye problem. It didn't actually improve my vision. I only see through one eye at a time, but that surgery was to strip a few muscles so my unused eye looks like it's looking straight ahead. So even though my insurance didn't consider it cosmetic, literally the only thing that had a hope of changing was my appearance. People treated me much better ever since. I found it easier to make friends than ever before. And except for when I'm very tired or sick, my eyes still look normal seven years and two more eye conditions later. So. Yes. Definitely worth it.
What examples of fragile masculinity have you encountered?	Something I've done which displays my male fragility is that I probably won't get a tattoo (that I really like) because I'm concerned people might find it too feminine.	I’m a waitress. The amount of dudes that will refuse/send drinks back because they come in a “girly” glass is unbelievable. The drinks usually consist of like 10 different kinds of fruit juices, liqueurs and schnapps but the hurricane glass and maraschino cherry is the line for them
For frat members - Are initiations in frats as crazy as they seem on tv? What was your initiation or the craziest one you know of?	It wasn't all that bad. I just had to suck a few dicks, and there was this one thing where everyone had a competition to see who could land a quarter in butthole, other than that though...not bad at all.	I got initiated in 2011 and live in the west coast. The shit we did during the semester leading up to what is known as "hell week" isn't bad. Since we can decide to leave at any point, they usually don't make you do anything TOO crazy before hell week. I got initiated with 22 other guys, and one of them tried to quit during hell week but at that point you've seen the worst of the worst so they don't really allow you to leave until you become initiated. As far as drinking goes, it's not forced but it's definitely encouraged. I've heard some stories of other fraternities and to my knowledge, frats in the south are on a whole different playing field when it comes to hazing.
What is challenging you the most today?	The fact that within the next decade all the power positions in this country are gonna be held by women, and us guys are about to go through the same shit women went through way back when	Baby girl (our first) born early this morning. She's a little early, but in perfect health. She's sleeping on my chest right now. All the feelings; all the worries.
What's a weird thing you did when you were younger that makes you cringe today?	I used to write suicide notes constantly and would wear a ribbon around my wrist counting down the years until I shot myself. Still here. Wish I had just done it and stopped being weak.	When I was in middle school I dressed like a goth.... But only on Mondays. I would go all-out with the makeup etc and I tried to get my friends to participate in "gothic Mondays". I don't think anyone ever did.
Gentlemen. What SHOULD we give a fuck about?	Yourself Your career Your family (assuming you still talk to the fucks) Your bitch (if you have one) But in all seriousness: you should probably pay attention to what's going on in government. Not so you can do anything to affect the outcome (cuz you can't because you're not in the Club), but so you can learn how the system is rigged so you can game it to your advantage. Actually, you should learn how *any* system you're a part of is set up/rigged then figure out how to game it to your advantage. If life has taught me anything, it's that following the rules (and/or getting caught) is for chumps and idiots.	Nothing, man. Everything's temporary, man. Just a big spinning ball of dirt in space, man. The existence of humanity is just a sneeze in the universe, man.
What makes you feel discouraged at work?	I work with kids as a speech therapist assistant/student. I work with three different kids. Two of them are so sweet. They are tough to work with but their sweetness makes up for it. They give me hugs and so many smiles. One of their moms told me that her child says my name at home and it made my heart melt. One of the kids is not very lovey though. He is just tough to work with without the incentive of him being sweet. He just wants to do his own thing without me. I like helping him but I get much more satisfaction out of helping the other two kids.	When some people can get away with certain things that not everyone can. At least once a day someone does something that makes me think "I'd get in SO MUCH TROUBLE if I did that!"
What kinds of questions make you immediately suspicious?	How are you today? Especially when it's out of the blue. I don't normally get asked unless someone wants something from me.	Who is your childhood super hero? What is the name of your third grade teacher? What is your mother’s maiden name?
Anyone has that one friend who is a total slayer when it comes to women? What qualities you think make him stand out from the rest?	A lot of them are scumbags, in my observation. Or they just outright use their resources to get the punani.	I know a guy that gets with a lot of good looking girls and for a while, a mutual friend and I weren't sure why. He's reasonably handsome sure, but the girls he takes home we're far better looking than "reasonably" pretty. We attribute it to his charisma. He really listens when you talk to him and will ask questions. If you don't see him for a month or two, he'll still ask you about something you discussed the last time you spoke. On top of that he's relaxed in his own skin. I think all that makes him attractive to women and then when he sees girls that know him on nights out, he finds it relatively easy to go home with them.
What are your fetishes?	Skinny white men. I am a bigger black women and I like to beat them and humiliate them. Payback for centuries of oppression ;) Edit: yay I am getting attacked for my fetish!	I'm submissive, so basically everything stems from there, with limits. Actually, I'd probably be a switch, but I'm submissive most of the time.

What's a hilarious/odd mental image that you can never "unsee"?	A local radio station pointed out that the song Pumped Up Kicks sounds like they're saying "faster than my puppet" instead of "faster than my bullet". I can't unhear it!	You know how dogs drag their butts across the floor? An ampersand looks like a stick person doing it. Can't unsee it. &
If someone you liked rejected you, how would you feel about being told the reason (in an honest and respectful manner)?	Absolutely. It fustrates me that i never know what it is. I have a type, and that type has things they like. Trying to change yourself for a certain person is foolish, but I want to change myself to meet what my dating type, in general, likes.	Honestly I think I would appreciate it. Sure, it would hurt but it would prevent me from internalizing and overthinking the rejection. It would also let me understand their perspective and hopefully make the rejection easier to deal with knowing how they feel about me. It also takes a lot for someone to be honest and respectful when rejecting someone, and I find that to be meaningful.
Any guy heard of "the grapefruit technique"?	First you going to cut of ONE side of the navel. You take that side off then you take it to the other side and then you .... do the same thing. SO why not just say "cut the navels off"	I cannot begin to describe how quickly i would lose my erection if a girl sounded like that when giving me head.
Do you often feel unsafe because of your gender? Why, or why not? Were you raised to be careful because of being a girl?	>However, I think it's because he was not raised as a girl and did not grow up being treated like you were a target because of your gender. Men are much more likely to be targeted for violence than women.	Starting in middle school, the girls (and just the girls) were pulled out of gym once or twice a year to learn about self-defense, every year. Part of this included lectures about not going places alone at night, always checking your car in case someone was in it, being aware of your surroundings, etc. I went to college in a sleepy, low-crime college town, but both the men and the women got constant talks about never letting women walk alone at night, always calling on a male friend or campus police officer to walk with you, admonishing the boys to always offer to walk a girl home, etc. It was drilled into our heads A LOT. So I never think, "I am unsafe because I am female," but I was very much taught to be careful because I'm female in specific ways that men definitely weren't.
What's the oddest thing you've done while driving alone?	Cry, but idk if thats odd. I cry a LOT while driving. If it’s too much i have to stop somewhere bc it blurs my vision	Screamed as loud as I could. It brings an adrenaline rush and buys you a few minutes if you're tired and at risk of falling asleep at the wheel.
Has AskMen become AskHighSchool ?	Not a man, love this Reddit though. Maybe you are growing up? Gasp! I promise not to tell. You may find a deeper satisfaction I'm askmen30. I go there for serious type questions. Not knocking you guys here at all. You are great for what you do. :)	I fucking hate the homework assignment Mr. Hamilton gave us. What the fucking fuck has fucking learning about fucking Egypt gonna fucking do to fucking help me in fucking life. Fucking fucker of a fuck. But no, man, what gave you that idea?
I became a first time mother to a son in January. What did your mom do right when raising you? What do you wish she'd known about raising a boy?	If you want to win mom of the year, just look up the reddit myth on the kid who broke both his arms.	There are two things my mom did that I always appreciated: There's that stereotype that men are hopeless without women but my mom always held my female peers to higher scrutiny. That way I could see that girls are just as flawed as boys and that I was worth something in a relationship. You could always hold someone to too much scrutiny and that would be an issue but she struck a balance that helped keep my romantic interests a bit more grounded. She would also always ask me if I could pause my video games before she asked me to do something. That was a very small courtesy but it was appreciated during boss battles.
As someone who is not interested in casual sex at all, how do I avoid going on dates with guys who just want casual sex?	Sex is an important part of a relationship, not something naughty and dirty that only souless degenerates engage in. I'm a relationship-minded person, but I wouldn't continue to date somebody who I didn't sleep with on the first or second date. To answer your question, you can't, really. Saying "I prefer to wait until we're a couple" is coming on a bit too strong, and uncomfortably old fashioned, but your choices boil down to that or risk wasting your time.	If you don't want to participate in the hookup culture, if a guy asks you out you need to tell him you would like to meet up for a lunch date or meet up at a coffee shop for dessert and coffee during the day. Then communicate with him. You don't have to say you aren't interested in casual sex, but it is fairly easy to let someone know that you are relationship minded so then he has the opportunity to ask you on a more "formal" date if you seem compatible.
What was the "last straw" that ended your last relationship? Was it a sum of a bunch of little things? Or a couple big things?	A whoooooooooooole bunch of little things followed by one really, really big thing and I was like nah nope gtg	He ruined my birthday. We were out with friends and he was in a nasty mood all night. Finally he yelled at me about wanting to leave already while I was saying goodbye to my friends, and they all laid into him. Seeing my friends that upset with him because of how he was treating me, I knew it was over right there.
What has made you decide to break off a previously close friendship?	Reading this thread I'm starting to understand now how a girl I was friends with initiated a "falling out" that I was completely unaware of and transitioned to just talking crap behind my back. I still don't really know what happened and consider myself fairly conscientious of others. Sometimes people do things and don't realize they've hurt or upset you. The least you can do is try not to overreact and not judge their actions purely based on your perception of how you should be treated. It's one thing if you've brought whatever bothers you to the person's attention and give them a chance to make it right. But communication is overrated I guess. This statement does not apply to situations where the person clearly wronged you and was unapologetic.	Money. I lent her money I had earned at my $7 per hour job so she could buy textbooks and wouldn't have to drop out of college. She dropped out anyway, and I never saw that money again.
Guys who are good with women: How good are you at sensing a woman is interested in you?	I only establish intent. I make it quite clear when I approach women that I'm attracted to them and my end goal is to get in between those sweet walls. Straight up tell them that I don't want to be their friend. I don't want to meet casually. I don't want to "hang out". I don't want to "just talk". I already have enough friends. I'm not interested in whatever she's interested in. Let's go to dinner. My goal is to nut deep in her belly. Works more often than you'd think. Also if a girl ghosts you, consider that a problem that solved itself.	If it's a bar or coffee shop or something and you've seen some indication of interest, usually a smile and prolonged eye contact, you can generally just walk up and say "Hi, I'm name, what's yours?" Small talk for a bit and then ask if you can sit with them. Don't worry about your intent, attractive women get hit on all the time so they know perfectly well what your intentions are. Just treat them like a person and if they're into you they'll reciprocate. If they don't then just take it in stride. I once asked a girl her name and she said "is that the best you can do?" I noped out super fast, I'm not some dancing monkey, I'm just a person trying to get to know you. Same goes for ghosting, it's just disrespectful, you've gotta learn that it's gonna happen and just let it be.
Women of Reddit, what is the most awkward run in with your ex?	Well the guy I was with after him got me pregnant about 6 months after the breakup. (We are happy together and unofficially married) Haven’t run into him yet, but his aunt tells me he’s very upset I became pregnant by someone else... She also had to tell him the kid wasn’t his. Well he shouldn’t have acted like my abusive father, or one of my exs I told him he started reminding me of. Told him I didn’t want a repeat... Baby girl is a part of our world now. I also look like I was never pregnant... soooo if I see him again things are gonna be awkward.	When my mum died, my ex's mum came to the funeral, insisted on taking a selfie with me, and then sent it to him. We'd been broken up for six years at that point and were not in contact. So, not a direct run in, but definitely the most awkward moment of my life so far.
Whats your favorite podcast/what podcasts are you listening to?	My favorite podcast ever is ‘Guys We Fucked’ it’s two female comedians who explore sexuality by interviewing a wide variety of people. They are helping erase the stigma of slut shaming women for being proud of their sexuality. It’s so funny and amazing! Definitely worth a listen. (You’ll end up binging many episodes like I did)	'Reply All' is a super interesting podcast which talks about all sorts of interesting subjects and they also investigate a lot of stories themselves which the discover about online.
What's the dumbest thing you've seen someone do that led them to not getting a job?	If you come into hooters to fill out an application and don’t bring a pen so you have to ask someone to borrow one ... the second you leave, your application goes into the trash. I’ve seen this happen many times EDIT: this is worded incorrectly. I saw one boss do this many times at one Hooters location. I have worked at many Hooters in multiple states and have not witnessed this at other locations	It wasn't my hire, but the manager down the hall from me. Guy had worked for us before and was coming back for a higher position. Showed up around 9am and spent the morning filling out his paperwork andBSing with us as we did our morning meetings. He came out to lunch with us and then he and the other manager went to the drug testing facility since it was next door to where we got lunch. I went back to the office and a while later the manger came back just shaking his head. Dude blew a .09. He knew he was coming in for his D/A test too.
What was the worst bachelorette party you've ever been to and why?	I didn't know where we were going.. I was 17 at the time.. turns out.. They took me to a male strip club. The chicks all screamed and tried to get the men over to rub on them. Damn. No self respect. If you were decent looking you wouldn't have to pay men to pay attention to you. I cringed the whole time and beat a fast retreat. Wtf. Friggin grannies begging for nuts in their face. Sad as fuck.	I've only been to one, and I found it IMMENSELY frustrating that the maid of honour thought that a group of 9 could walk into a Mexican restaurant, on Cinco de Mayo, on a Saturday, in a city with a population of 6 million, and not need a fucking reservation.
What are your opinions on spa days for men? Do you think self care on your hands and feet are important?	No, we should stop normalizing consumerism for vanity. A woman always showing off her new nails and eyebrows is a turnoff. A man doing it is worse.	The last time I tried to cut my toe nails I ended up with blood on the floor. So I went to a local salon and the attendant gently removed all the in-grown stuff and did a great job with the rest of the nails. Lots of weird looks from the women customers but I don't care. I'm going to keep going.
What TV show (past or present) do you think is extremely underappreciated? What makes it so good in your opinion?	The Mindy Project. I know people mostly know about it, but it is perennially underrated. It is the only show that can make me laugh out loud. Every character- Mindy, Jeremy, Morgan, Peter, Jodi- is hilarious. If you haven't watched it yet, I *highly* recommend you start. Edit: My guilty pleasure is Young & Hungry. I'm embarrassed to admit that I watch it, but it's just such a feel-good show!	A lot of people on the internet like Pushing Daisies, but nobody who I talk to in reality has heard of it, even fans of Hannibal (same creator). It's a show about a piemaker who can raise the dead by touching them and kill them again with another touch. If he lets them live, someone else dies. He uses this power to solve crimes. For such a morbid premise, it's a really upbeat show. And visually stunning.
Women who went from very dysfunctional relationships to a very healthy one, what was the biggest surprise/eye-opener?	It is not actually normal for a partner to be so jealous of your past relationships that he sex-shames and abuses you. A good partner doesn't give a shit about your past.	Seeing their name on the call display, or their car in the driveway at the end of the day, or hearing their key in the lock is never accompanied by anxiety or a sinking feeling.
When a girl is riding you, what are you supposed to do?	Talk dirty and grab her hair kiss her face spank her ass. Ask her if she likes your cock. Say you're my little slut aren't you? Then say my turn slut and grab her ass and pump into her. lick her nipples and stare into her eyes slap her face lightly.	Don't just lie there like a lifeless toy. Interact with her, be affectionate, be playful, let her know how good it feels. Caress as much of her as you can reach. Grab the sides of her hips and hold her down on you for a moment. Pull her close and give her a big ol' hug. Kiss her and play with her hair. Play with her hands and kiss her hands; or simply hold them for a bit. Let your voice out for her. There's a lot of things to do, there's a living, breathing *woman* on top of you, not a block of ice.
[Serious] Men of reddit what was it like having a girlfriend who was a victim of sexual assault?	It depends on of it is severely affecting the relationship. If it is I move on. I will not sign up to be somebody’s therapy or therapist.	There were times when everything is going well and something would trigger her and I'd have to stop just be there for her. Sometimes it'd be just normal daily activates, sometimes foreplay, sometimes during sex. Years later she rarely has this happen to her, but there are still things I've learned will trigger her and I just avoid doing them (coming up behind her to give her a hug).
Ladies, what sex act are you scared to ask your partner to do?	I don't have anything I'm scared to ask my SO for. Both of us are into some really kinky stuff, so we discuss things regularly because that's what you do if you want a healthy sex life.	I want to watch my husband masturbate. We've been married for 12 years and it took me about a decade to ask him but he won't do it. Sad times... Maybe someday! I let him watch me.
Why is your pet a jerk?	I have been super excited about getting my daughter's homeschool room set up. I finally got help moving things out and cleaning it yesterday. I got to hang posters, organize supplies, and finally hang the brand-new bulletin board that I am so excited to decorate later this week. Except when I go in this morning to admire the room, I see that my cat decided to use it as a scratching post and it is destroyed. I wanted to cry and kill him. I know this isn't such a big deal really, but I have been scrimping and saving for all the things we need and that was my little- not so needed- fun item. I still have other things we need worse so I won't be able to replace it for a little while. Fucking cat bastard.	For the love of God, rabbit, please stop humping my leg. My leg is not another rabbit. You cannot procreate with my leg. Stop it.
I'm quitting my phd program after only 3 months because it's too much for me. Feels pretty shitty, have you guys ever quit something pretty major without knowing what's next?	I had to quit my computational mathematics studies 3 months *before* getting a bachelor's degree. I was good at it, in the region of 75-80% scores without any effort. Going through classes and exams was easy and fun for me, but due to my life situation I just couldn't have done the thesis. So instead of heading towards highly paid perspective field, I have only useless all-round secondary education, which makes me suitable for a cashier or so. It feels pretty bad, especially because it wasn't my fault. I had absolutely no idea what to do after. Later I figured out how to get at least into IT, by taking state/EU funded server administration courses. But it's still way below my intellectual potential.	Have you considered posting in /r/gradschool for thoughts and advice? There's posts over there about crappy advisors and students hating their program all the time. I think you'd probably get constructive advice, not just "deal with it!" responses.
What's the most hurtful thing your SO has ever said to you without realizing how hurtful it was?	"There's no point in talking to you when you get like this." There's always a point in talking it out.	I'm really good at doing my makeup, and used to enjoy dolling up for parties and such. He said, probably without realising how much it hurt, that without makeup you're a 4, but with makeup you're a 6 or 7! That still haunts me, years and years and years later. Needless to say we're no longer together, but I still find no joy in dolling up and making myself pretty anymore.
Ladies, have any of you actually been told to smile by strangers?	Huh. I say this to people. I didn't realize this was a bad thing. Does it help that I usually say it as, "Smile! It gets better!" or a variant, regardless of the sex of the person, or what I perceive to be their attractiveness? I usually only say it to folks who look bummed.	Yes. I was walking to my bus, my dog had just died, I was in no mood to smile. A guy told me "You should smile! Life isn't that bad!" when I didn't he said "And that's why you will die alone." What The Fuck? I live in the US, Missouri.
If you've ever broken up with a woman due to physical features out of her control, what was that reason?	Honestly, her boobs were really ugly. I actually made her keep her shirt on. I was only 18 back then and a bit of an asshole. Baloney nipples are baloney nipples though.	Voice. I just couldn't fucking listen to her talk. Which was no fault of her own. She was lovely other than that. But her voice was like nails on a chalk board.
What is your favorite book that nobody knows about?	Everybody knows about it, but I wish more people actually read *The Autobiography of Malcolm X*. It's so profound, and he was such an important figure in the fight for equality. I despite that he's basically been reduced to as a comparison point for Magneto in *X-Men*. He was so much more than that, and the fact that he's treated as some sort of foil for MLK Jr, instead of an ally is a damn shame.	*East* by Edith Pattou. It's a young adult book but remains one of my favorites. It combines a number of myths, fairy tales, and legends, and pulls them together so seamlessly that you only notice once you're well versed in mythology. I feel like I discover something new every time I read it.
Are you okay with your bf/SO following very sexual models on instagram/snapchat?	Im male and have nothing to contribute answer-wise, but i have a question, mostly aimed towards the women that are bothered by this idea. is being subscribed to lots of nsfw subreddits the same thing in your mind? If not what makes it different?	It bothers me because it's public. I don't have to ever know when he's watching porn and it usually ends once the action is done. Whereas Instagram/snapchat is something people interact with a lot and it now carries into your every day life. Plus the accounts you follow on Instagram are public so now I see what you're bombarding yourself with when you're always on Instagram. Like must you constantly have to look at sexualized women?
What’s the best hotel you ever got to stay at?	Disclaimer:- I am not a woman (since I am posting in r/AskWomen) &#x200B; &#x200B; how does one afford hotel rooms costing more than 100$ / night? barely any of the first 20 odd hotel I saw here come anywhere close to my weekly budget for a hotel room. 400$ a night! the castle (but obv) was 800$ per night. &#x200B; I wonder if these offers are all including every meal one eats during the stay and all facilities, spa, massages, adventure park or yoga etc courses are included in the price? &#x200B; edit:- I tend to look at the money I actually have in my hand and make my budget. I do not think of credit when it comes to a holiday. Maybe core engineering doesn't pay as much ? (snide comment to myself really)	Ashford Castle in Ireland. I mean, it’s a literal castle. What’s not to like? It had the most beautiful pool and spa area. The tea service was excellent. I felt like I was a lady in Downton Abbey. I took a falconry lesson on the grounds. Overall amazing experience. It was like living out my girlhood fantasy.
How do you ladies move on?	There's no easy solution or one way to do this. After my last major breakup it took me months to move on. But once I took that first step, I was able to keep going from there. The first step is the hardest, it depends on how far removed from your last situation you are.	The last time I went through a very painful breakup, I knew I'd be seeing my ex in public not long after. I wrote a list of everything I didn't like about him, as nitpicky and shallow as possible. In reality I loved him and couldn't stand living without him, but on this list I was brutal. As I rode the subway the day of our meeting, I read over the 30+ things on the list, stuff like "gross toenails" and "wears stupid hat." It helped.
Am I in the wrong for wanting alone time from my girlfriend?	It's not wrong at all; it's actually healthy and necessary. It actually sounds like she's trying to guilt or manipulate you by telling you it hurts her feelings.	No you're not. You need to build a healthy communication with your girlfriend. Sometimes I get back from work and I just want to listen to music, watch a movie or play video games without talking about my day. I tell my girlfriend that I that I need to clear my head for a while and that we'll talk around dinner. She has absolutely no problem with it and uses this free time to do things she needs to do. As long as you explain that with empathy and make it clear that it's just about recharging your batteries, she won't be offended.
What's a common opinion expressed by your male friends that makes you sad/frustrated?	"It doesn't matter to me what my girl decides to be as long as she's happy and not a sex worker." I get that they don't care if she's a doctor or lawyer but people take pride in their profession so it sucks that they could care less.	Whenever a female teacher is caught with a student, it's high-fives all around. They never stop to ask themselves if the student was even consenting (although still a minor). It's like it never crosses their mind that the kid could be an unwilling victim.
Honestly a little embarassing to ask but... How the fuck do you take a selfie?	You don't. Taking pictures of yourself and posting them all over social media in a pathetic attempt to fish for attention and validation is the second most narcissistic thing you can do. I think first place still belongs to masturbation in the mirror.	For the love of god don't take a selfie looking down at your phone! No one wants to look up your nostrils!
How do I cope with always being inferior to my best friend?	Yeah you're Swedish which means you're automatically better looking and smarter than most Americans. I have no sympathy for you	Start looking at the two of you as a team. Is the game attracting women? He's bringing attractive ladies into your circle; the team is winning. Is the game lifting? Y'all are both making gains and getting stronger; the team is winning. While "get over it" is technically the right answer, that's basically impossible. What you need to do is replace your jealousy with something else. Use positive self-affirmations: when you find yourself thinking envious thoughts, remind yourself that your team is winning; when you find yourself putting yourself in his shadow, remind yourself of your positive attributes. If you keep doing that, eventually you'll find it getting easier, and becoming your first thoughts instead of corrections.
What is it like to take anti-anxiety medicine?	Don’t really appreciate this, didn’t say I was an alcoholic or stoner but I’m literally in college and do enjoy doing those things occasionally like every other college kid.	Me. Mine is mostly social, so I’m on a low dose of buspar 2 times a day. I’ve really noticed a difference. Been talking to random people at the gym and in lines more often than i used to, without my heart racing and feeling like I’m going to throw up. The first few days were rough as my body adjusted to the meds, but now I don’t even notice those side effects anymore. Edit: i feel like my life is better. Side effects are different with different meds. Ask your doctor if you can drink or smoke. My dr said I’m allowed to drink.
Women married to the person they love most in the world...what's it like?	It feels like having a best friend you may or may not redrum every other week abs then realizing it’s your best friend again. Fun times!	Having a best friend and a soul mate all in one. Waking up everyday knowing I have someone in my corner who will always want what is best for me and our son. Feeling 100% secure in our life and being happy, even though some people think our lives are boring.
Men of reddit, how do you avoid mentally checking out on life?	Read Marx and Trotsky. I know, but seriously, just do it. You're not crazy at all. I think you need a sense of proportion about these problems, everyone will tell you nothing can be done about them and that might be true for the time being. But things wont stay this way forever, history is moving forward and the best thing you can do is remind yourself that change is the only certainty, and that the apparent stasis the world and even your life seems to be in wont last.	I am checked out. I drag myself to a boring job every day and spend my free time punching people and training to punch people. I intend to punch people for fun until I'm too old, the teach other people to punch people until I die. (What Im trying to say here is that my hobby is boxing and not much else makes me happy.)
Men of AskMen what is something unexpected you have learned from being in a relationship?	That I hate commitment. Just wanted to bang and go on dates with other girls the whole time. Glad that's over.	I love having my head pat. Not like up and down like slapping, like stoking a hand through my hair, and that kind of stuff
What is a subculture you identify with that most people either don't know about, or severly misunderstand?	I’m a 22 year old Hispanic woman who is a classic liberal, I enjoy Ben Shapiro’s content, Jordan B Peterson and Dave Rubin, also I love shoe0nhead. I don’t know if it’s a culture, but I know I’m not that common in these circles.	I'm a CouchSurfer. Thanks to a bunch of thirsty guys writing aspirational articles full of what they hoped would be the truth and those articles being shared for shock value, people think that CouchSurfing (or any hospitality exchange) is some sort of sexual thing. It couldn't be further from the truth.
Have you ever felt contempt towards your SO? How so?	I put a Lucha Libre mask on (Like [those ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/lucha-libre-mask/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Alucha%20libre%20mask) ) and was messing around in the garden. The night was falling and one point, I see my SO in the lit kitchen, starting dinner. I positioned myself at the window and stared at him, immobile. When he saw me, he dropped the pan and screamed like a little girl, for a long time. I am still pissing myself just remembering it but he was really angry afterwards and, to be honest, I lost a bit of respect for him seeing his super weak and flailing reaction. He will protect me from a lot of things, however, if a masked psycho is after us, I better deal with it.	Yes and once I did there was no going back. It was the beginning of the end. He was lazy, hypocritical and selfish. My friend always said once one person mentions that maybe you should break up or take a break it is never the same. One day I said it and I realized she was right.
Have you ever had a day so bad that it stops being terrible and starts being funny?	Eh sometimes but a lot of them are rather demoralising so its not funny or even cynical funny more, "Fuck this thing called my life". I cannot specify but often it has to do with sicknesses, money or family drama.	Woke up to get ready for school. Put on a big pot of coffee so I could have some and there'd be leftover coffee for my parents. Go to get dressed. Come back and I forgot to put the pot back in the coffee machine, and for some dysfunctional reason the machine still made 6 cups of coffee all over the counter and the floor. Ugh! Clean it all up and make another cup to take to school. While walking into school: Drop my coffee mug and spill all coffee on the floor. Ugh! Go to the cafe on campus and buy a coffee, spilled it on my jacket. IM FUCKIN DONE. NAP TIME.
What are your experiences with "White Knights" and/or "Nice Guys" like?	I don't think I have much experience with them at all. I'm always careful to not lead guys on so I feel like I never had any of them be into me. I'm too aloof for them.	I play a lot of Xbox, particularly CoD. I always end up hearing a couple of "nice guys" try to defend my honor against trash talkers. It gets on my nerves. I don't need them to defend me espcially when I start the trash talking, have a good comeback, and am in the top 5 in the lobby.
What is one thing your crush did that immediately turned you off?	She drinks wine like twice every other day I first thought it was fancy/didn’t mind but now I’m genuinely concerned	Ghosted for a bit then returned and then ghosted and repeated. First time was a huge turn off and I was pissed to the point of wanting to block her. But I was lonely so went right back at it each time. Should have just moved on after the first time.
Germophobes, what is something you see people do that makes you absolutely cringe?	I'm not exactly a germophobe, though I flipped shit the other day when my husband wanted to thaw chicken in the sink... But, I'm an allergy mom... I'm absolutely paranoid about cross contamination. My son is breast fed (he's only 5 months old), so it's my food I have to be careful of, but I've watched my mom butter a slice of bread and then use the same knife to scoop out jam. So the jar of jam is now contaminated. I worry a lot about stuff like that.	I don't know if this is a "germophobe" thing, but SNEEZE INTO YOUR ELBOW DEAR GOD PLEASE. It's so much more sanitary.
What attitude of men you hate the most and why?	Men who act like all women possess the worst qualities of the woman they just broke up with/divorced. I see this in some of the strange reactions I get to things I write. If I say something about crying, then some guy will come along and say something like, "Yeah, but you don't want to see your husband crying," because his last girlfriend was emotional, but didn't allow him to be. Similarly, I see this in the type of men who say divorcing was the best thing they ever did and they'll forever be single. Not every woman is like their ex, but they're so angry they project that out into the world.	Maybe this isn’t considered an “attitude” but for me it’s when a guy knows you’re mad or upset but COMPLETELY disregards the actual reason you are upset and tries to make it into something else. I once saw a meme that summed it up perfectly. It said something like “a guy goes to chick fil-a with his ex girlfriend and when you get mad he goes “how you gonna be mad at me for eating chicken?”And ignores the fact that it’s because he went with his ex girlfriend. I’ve had that shit happen to me so many times. Like they will know I’m mad about X but then try saying why are you mad about Y? It’s infuriating.
I feel that my girlfriend is insensitive to the fact that I don't want to hear the details of her sexual history, but she accuses me of slut shaming. Am I in the wrong?	Dude maybe the slut thing is part of who she is and she wants to be able to share that with you. Some people can see sex as a hobby. A fun activity to engage in, sometimes with strangers, always enjoyable. She doesn't necessarily see *all* sex that way, but she seems more capable of looking at a sexual relationship very casually than you are. It's okay to be either way. You gotta talk to her about it from that angle, rather than an I'm-right-and-you're-wrong angle, to reach an acceptable compromise.	I am a pretty imaginative person so when I hear something I tend to imagine it. I would not be able to take it if the person I was dating made me constantly visualize them having sex with another person. It has nothing to do with disapproval for their actions or choices in the past or future - I just don't want to think about that stuff! Think of it this way: Everyone poops. Do I want to hear the details of your last poop, the image, the smell, the size, how great it felt afterward? Hell no! Does this mean I'm shaming you for pooping? Um, no.
Experienced ladies, what is something you wished older women had told you when you were younger, like in your early twenties?	If a handsome and intriguing man tells you that he's incapable of intimacy, *believe him*. Believe him and run screaming into the night!	No one, and I mean NO ONE, is paying as much attention to you as you think they are. That insecurity you feel? Yeah, everyone around you has just as much of it as you do. Stop worrying about how you seem to others and just do your thing. Edit: our usernames should have tea together.
What's the pettiest reason you've dumped someone?	Two months into dating, we went to see a movie. I bought a large soda to share and a large popcorn for him because I said I didn't want any. Throughout the whole movie he hogged the drink and didn't offer any popcorn. Stopped seeing him after that.	He said "touche" the way we now say "lol". Like it was just a meaningless filler word used to respond to anything. "I'm not coming over tonight" "touche". "Grab me a beer and I'll be there in ten" "touche". I'm not even an English snob. I don't correct other people when they use the wrong "to" or anything. But that shit made me insane. He was also a late 30s barfly/bouncer still living with multiple roommates and dating 19 year olds, but it was the touche that led to the breakup.
[Serious] Women of Reddit who struggle with mental health, how do you get yourself to practice self-care and do things that make you feel happy on bad days?	I struggle with mental health and have had problems with physical health as well lately, which means my mental health is REALLY suffering now lol. I love self care, and really believe in it. I make an effort to lay back and chill every single day. That could mean meditating, taking a nap, putting on a face mask, taking a hot shower, taking a new exercise class, writing, reading, watching a favorite TV show or movie, catching up with a friend, venting to someone...it really depends on the day. But self care really helps. I believe in it for sure.	I will never be “good enough” ... But I’ll be damned if I didn’t get a lot of small things done today. I’m a failure in the big picture... But cleaning the kitchen, working on a project, and getting my work uniform clean and ironed make me feel otherwise. Baby steps. Small things. I’m not going to fix all of the mistakes overnight, but- I can keep my life held together one small piece at a time.
What quality about yourself annoys you the most?	One of them I have been contemplating lately: When people make uninformed, unintelligent comments which have a flair of over-generalization, stereotyping, racism, prejudice, sexism, etc., I typically address it and use data and facts to educate the individual. I never do this in an aggressive manner - I see it as more of an opportunity to educate; however, I am sure this has caused negative impact on networking opportunities, job-related junk, etc. /grumble	I'm not a good listener. In recent years I've really tried to improve on that, but I still find myself cutting people off in conversation sometimes, or not fully taking in what someone is saying. I also come across as a cold/distant person. I won't respond to messages half the time. I'm amazed my friends still bother with me.
Women of Reddit, when has doing the right thing ever backfired on you?	Not a woman buy tried to help drunk lesbians in the woods, ended up going to jail that night because I had some weed over at my campsight	One time I was at school and went to get Starbucks. It was cold and rainy. There was a homeless guy across the street, so I bought him a hot chocolate when I got mine. When I went to go give him his drink, another homeless guy showed up. I didn't drink any hot chocolate that day.
What is your fuckboy story?	We don't currently consider "fuckboy" or any of its derivations to be gendered slurs. The reason is because it is not repurposing an existing term to turn it into a pejorative for a gender (like bitch, cunt, or dick). It is also an inseparable phrase. On top of both of those it's a made up term from a Cam'ron song. We also would not consider "scrub" or "creep" to be a gendered slur. Hope that clears things up for our people reporting the thread. If you have any questions about it, use modmail and we can discuss it.	We don't currently consider "fuckboy" or any of its derivations to be gendered slurs.

what do you think about the growing "cruelty-free/vegan" trend in America?	Folks, this is not “argue with a vegan” thread (or “argue with an omnivore”). Feel free to answer as a top level comment. Do not go in and argue with vegans and vegetarians (or omnivores) about their views. Thanks.	Folks, this is not “argue with a vegan” thread (or “argue with an omnivore”).

Why don't female performers and artists get groupies to the same extent as male performers/artists?	Look at who those Females date normally. Hypergamy comes into place and the woman want other 1% men. You would have to be something/someone special for the Star to even LOOK your way.	If your definition of groupie is a fan that's willing to have a ONS with the artist then I'd say there are more male groupies but you don't notice them because it's the norm. I don't think there are many (single)men (fan or not) who would refuse to have a ONS with Beyoncé for example. But if they were were as open about it as female groupies they'd all be labeled perverts, stalkers, ...
What's something people say to make you feel better, but it only makes things worse?	Going out and meeting people or doing social things. Yeah just what I need, more vampires sucking the happy out of what little happy I have at the moment.	plenty of fish in the sea or something of the like after a break up....I don't want another fish. I had the fish I wanted.
My wife has attempted suicide several times over the years. I am thinking it is time to leave her and try to start my life over. I know she will kill herself if I divorce her. What do I do?	Walk away, if she kills herself so be it, ultimately there is little you can do and it's unfair you don't get to live your life.	If I were you it would discuss this with her psychiatrist and work towards a plan to get her into a live-in therapy program. During that program I would ask for the divorce. She needs serious help and monitoring this does not seem like the job for someone she visits once a week.
Would you send nudes to an SO? If so, what are your expectations on what they should do with them after a breakup?	Yes. Honestly, I expect them to delete them, because it's fucking weird to jerk it to an ex. EDIT: The degree to which some people in this thread think they're entitled to seeing a woman's naked body because she showed it to them before is fucking astounding.	I send nudes to anyone I have a sexual relationship with. I told my ex when we were dating that I didn't care if he held onto the ones I sent him if we were to breakup but that, of course, the expectation would always be that he wouldn't distribute them. I *do* expect him to delete them once he has someone new because I know I'd be pissed as fuck if I found out my boyfriend had nudes of his ex.
What is one thing you think men oversimplify?	How long it can take to get ready. Yes, there's the common perception that women take forever to get ready, but many men don't understand why. They think makeup and hair styling is much simpler than it is. Also, feelings. Sometimes, I'll feel a million different ways about something but many men tend to view things as black or white. Even when they understand the gray of it, it still comes out simpler to them than it is to me.	Probably themselves. I've heard a lot of men claim that men really are super simple and straightforward all the time and all they think about is sex, food, and sometimes absolutely nothing. The rest is stuff he doesn't give a shit about. Except no, because if you treat a guy as though he *is* that way in a friendship or relationship, you're gonna have a bad time. Guys have layers and nuanced emotional responses to things, even if they don't think so or want to articulate them. A lot of guys will claim the super simple thing, and then talk about how it's hard being a guy because they have all these feelings they can't open up to people about like women can because guys aren't supposed to have them.
How many cats can a single woman own before it becomes a red flag for you? What about horses? Snakes? Frogs?	Don't know....Depends of the house. Say if she lives in a huge country house and has 100+ cats there, it definitely wouldn't be a red flag to me. I love cats :3 especially furry cats. Horses, no i hate horses, even one is a red flag, they smell bad, always with flys around their ass, plus they're ugly. Horse for me is a meal. Don't know why people have so much prejuducie about eating horse, they taste like cow meat. Frogs are nice, but they're better in a country house as well, in a cool garden.	It's not the number: it's when they start getting unironically anthropomorphised that's the issue. Also there's a difference between someone who owns, say, six horses because she's a horse-nut, and someone who owns six horses because she runs a stable and riding school as a successful business. Also: as someone who owns more guitars than limbs, I shouldn't throw stones.
Redditors that have both children and neices &amp; nephews, how does your parenting style differ from that of your siblings?	My sister formula fed used cio started solids super young that sort of mom . I breast fed til 18 mos didn’t introduce solids until 6 mos never used cio , I’m big on car seat safety . So we’re pretty opposite .	I'm definitely more free-range than my sister. My 13yo son has never done anything to cause me to hover (come home late, not answer if I call him) so I pretty much leave him to his own devices while my sister insists on knowing exactly where hers are going, with whom etc
Men of reddit, how are you a rebel?	I'm an active member of an anarcho-syndicalist organization. I spend my evening handing out agitational pamphlets outside of warehouses (very successfully, I might add) or writing satirical songs attacking local authority figures. My days are spent organizing in my main workplace (my second job is a worker-run food shelf), and my other hours organizing in my tenement block and my neighborhood. On weekends I write letters to our imprisoned members. I've gone toe-to-toe with counter-protestor vigilantes, and on some occasions had to meet force with force. I've gone toe-to-toe with the police too, for which reason I'm currently facing charges. Also, I intentionally give wrong directions to yuppies and tourists who visit my neighborhood. So, that's fun.	I wore a graphic tee to my job today, and we're not allowed to. They've been pissing me off a lot recently #passiveagressive
What is a bad present you've gotten?	One year my grandparents inherited a bunch of money, and everyone knew. But everyone got cheap-ass sweatshirts, and after everyone opened everything, my grandpa gave my grandma a MASSIVE 3D TV, with an X Box one, and multiple games and 3D movies. -_-	My mother is pro at shit gifts: I'm very lactose intolerant and she got me a chocolate fountain. I did all the cooking in our house because my mother is terrible at cooking so she got me a 'Anyone can learn to cook in 24hrs' cookbook. The biggest slap in the face was probably when she got me one of those microwavable hotwater bottle things because 'you've always complained so much about your period pain'. I don't even own a microwave and I have Endometriosis, which my mother always downplayed and ignored. I'm having surgery soon because of how bad my adhesions are and my chronic pain. Fuck you, mum.
What do you consider the top 5 biggest stereotypes made by men towards women?	Online: 1. Alpha FUX beta BUX. 2. Gold diggers. 3. Feminazis. 4. Women get laid way easier than guys. 5. Women are irrational. In real life the stereotypes I encounter aren't as farfetched but maybe that's because of the people I encounter on a regular basis.	I'm too lazy to list five things, but I am really tired of hearing that all women care about is money. Like, no. We don't all max out our credit cards on Gucci and expect a man to pay it off for us.
What's the strangest/funniest reaction you've received after rejecting someone?	You heard me wrong, I said you were fat and ugly. If I'm so fat and ugly why don't you fuck off back to your seat and stop bothering me?	When I was using OKCupid, I once got, "I'm going to tell everyone I was rejected by the ugliest girl on this site!" Uh, dude, that insults you more than it insults me.
How common is it for men to believe that sexual partner count influences how a woman's vagina looks/feels?	Probably not uncommon because its how it works for some other organs (like anus). Its not like men have vaginas so they just extrapolate based on the organs they have/know more about.	I would just like to point out that if muscles truly worked like that, well your anus would be kind-of a limited-use deal. Can't say I know of anyone who ever took a few large dumps and got permanent Olestra-butt from it.
Girls who have been "ghosted" by your boyfriend, what was the last text or conversation you had?	He wasn't anything close to a boyfriend, but "send me a pic of u". Aaaand we're done. Not sure which of us was the ghoster, but it doesn't matter.	Mine was before texting was a thing. I was an unexperienced teen, he was 21 with a fast car. He came over my house when my mom wasn't home, and all of a sudden he got up and started putting his shoes on and said "I'm going to Jack in the Box." Totally ghosted me. Me and my friends STILL make jokes 30-years later about him coming back from Jack in the Box, or about how the line must be really long at Jack in the Box. I did see him working on a roof one day, a couple years after he ghosted me. I smiled, waved and walked on by.
Women who have never struggled with weight, how do you eat?	I think some of it is genetics. Other than that: Ever since I was a kid I disliked sauces on things. So no salad dressings, no condiments on burgers, etc. i also don't drink pop cuz I dislike the sugar rush. I like mustard, but I don't think that has many calories. Also, I think I must be allergic/intollerent to something cuz fairly often food just goes right through me. Maybe I don't absorb as many calories at those times. Lastly, I definitely eat less than others. I think much of it has to do with me being unable to tell the difference between stress pain and hunger pain. So sometimes when I'm hungry I just assume I'm actually just stressed and just ignore it. So sometimes I forget to eat for a while. Edited to add: I'm not an active person. Just for comparison's sake.	I've never really over eat. I don't like soda and I make pretty good choices when I do snack and eat. There is a difference when I don't though. I'll be bloated and my skin looks bad. I don't believe if I ate whatever I would stay thin. I think another thing is that I do not eat fast food regularly. Maybe once a month if that and it's either Chipotle or Burgerville which I don't think is too bad compared to what else is out there.
If a guy says that he is willing to have sex with me but won't date me, does this mean that he only sees me as a thing to fuck or can I still trust that he sees me as a human?	You seem quite offended. Thankfully, physical attractiveness has little to do with how dateable a person can be. Basically, your inability to understand his meaning only confirms it; you're pretty, but you're not good enough otherwise (personality, compatibility, etc.) to date.	He probably thought he came off as coming on to you, and wanted to rectify it. He still sees you as human, but he probably thinks you don't have a personality compatible enough with him to date.
Ladies who have done any sort of ancestral genetic testing along the lines of 23andMe, what did you learn? Did you discover anything interesting about yourself or your maternal line?	I did 23andme earlier this year. Mostly, I wondered whether my mother was really full Chinese or perhaps only half, but the test came back and said my DNA is 40.9% Chinese, so I guess she was what she said she was, at least in that regard. My maternal haplogroup is R11, which 23andme says: *Your maternal haplogroup, R11, traces back to a woman who lived approximately 21,000 years ago.* And I have 292 Neanderthal variants, which evidently is more than 71% of others on 23andme. I thought that was interesting. Also, it told me I'm not a carrier of anything they test for, so that's good!	I did the Ancestry DNA test and the DNA part was interesting enough, mostly what I expected. What I didn't expect was that they show you other people who could be 1-4 cousins of yours that have taken the test. I didn't pay it much mind until I got a message from another user. It showed we were likely 2nd cousins but I didn't know who they were. I have a big family but I knew who everyone was, except for my mom's biological father because he deserted my grandmother when she was pregnant. It turns out, the guy the messaged me is my mom's bio cousin who we didn't know existed. From there we learned more about my mom's paternal family. It has been quite surreal.
Aside from the illegal or immoral, what is something that you will not pay money for?	I absolutely refuse to buy any meat, animal products and items tested on animals. (Yes, I'm vegan) We all say we love animals and we're against animal cruelty. But we pay people to mutilate, torture and slaughter animals FOR US...and it's not for any necessity, it's not because we need to for our health, it's just because we like the way they taste.	I won't pay money to get my own money out of the bank. (I make exceptions overseas, but fuck paying ATM fees at home). Edit: not American, these lovely suggestions won't help me I'm afraid.
My boyfriend left me alone in his apartment. What would you do in this situation?	I'd go home or go out and do whatever it is I like doing on my days off instead of lurking in my boyfriends apartment all day. Surely he didn't lock you in, go outside and enjoy your day!	Try on his clothes and send him pictures. Try to replicate outfits he's worn in his FB profile pics and ask him "Who Wore it Better?"

Pretty women, do you ever feel like it's harder to make other girl friends or be accepted by other women?	Stop trying to befriend them. They don't want to be your friend. And you don't want to be their friend. They are coworkers, they don't care. Who cares about them, they will never want the best for you or stick up for you, and they will always undermine you and if you give them any info they will try to twist it up and make you loose your job. This is my experience and it happens on the dot every single time.	Honestly- I'll give you a viewpoint from a relatively average-looking woman. I am intimidated by more beautiful women for sure. I do think this comes partially out of jealousy but mostly comfort. If I'm looking to connect with someone in the workplace, or some social event, I will usually migrate towards women who are less attractive. Out of a large pool of people, it's most likely that the prettier ones already have friends, or a boyfriend, or will be somehow approached easily and if I'm around I'll get discarded. Of course that's definitely not true but it's wired in my brain. One of my biggest fears is being in a group talking and slowly being edged out of the conversation. With ugly girls I feel more secure that won't happen and can let my guard down.
[NSFW] What is the most disgusting thing you have ever seen?	I can't really think of anything recently, but the other night, I fell asleep with a nature documentary still running and woke up a bit later to see my tv screen filled with maggots squirming around while the narrator discussed the life cycle of bugs. That wasn't too pleasant.	I was sitting across from a guy in the bus one night. He had a really nasty cough. At one point he, I shit you not, coughed up an entire handful of goo. *A handful*. Then he sat there with the goo for a while, looking around the bus. I think he was confused about what to do with the goo/looking for a place to wipe it. I guess he didn't want to wipe his handful of cough goo on something in the bus so he brought his hand to his mouth and he FUCKING ATE IT.
Girls, what's your alternative when you want to eat something sweet (chocolate, candy, ice cream, etc) but want to keep it healthier/less fattening?	I drink a glass of soymilk instead, as soymilk is actually pretty sweet but very healthy and tasty. I also eat fruits instead of those sweet treats. When I'm grocery shopping, I try my best to buy popsicles instead of ice cream because even though the sugar content is crazy high, at least there's vitamin C and whatnot and I feel less guilty.	Smaller portions of the same foods, assuming it's a specific craving. Eating one of those itty-bitty Snickers bars (the ones smaller than fun size) when you want a whole Snickers is more satisfying than trying to trick your brain into thinking a bell pepper is a Snickers bar.
Ladies, is there an ex that just won't leave you alone?	my first boyfriend. i broke up with him ten years ago, it was far from an amicable breakup, and he still contacts me. for a while i thought [hoped?] he made another suicide attempt and was successful, because i didn't hear from him for a couple years. but he wished me a happy birthday a couple months ago.	My ex wrote a book about me. A literal fucking book. Talk about not leaving you alone, *I get to walk into bookstores and see this shit*. I hope this makes you feel marginally better.
What’s the worst thing you’ve said to your SO in anger?	The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes. As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay. We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets. Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.	My step dad called my mom a "plump little raisin"... she doesn't have any wrinkles and she's not even a little bit on the chubby side lmao.
Anyone else constantly labelled 'sweet and innocent'? What does it actually mean?	The last person who said something like that to me said that I still had light in my eyes. He said that the world still hasn't stolen my light. And then he ripped my heart out and I took my light into a deep depression. Yeah. Fuck that light. I still have it, I guess, I just don't share it with anyone anymore except for an amount of people that I can count on one hand and aren't related to me. I guess it meant naïveté, yes. But also being able to see the goodness in things without the cloudy glasses of fucked up experiences. I've been through somethings - but I can accept that situations aren't indicative of life in its totality. The flowers still bloom although a tsunami can decimate an entire coastline.	I don't often get those words specifically but that seems to be the general vibe that people get. It's because I'm tiny (4'11) and quiet, nice, and a wee bit shy. It doesn't bother me but I don't think it's very accurate. My life has most definitely not allowed me to remain innocent to any degree. Just because I choose to keep my thoughts to myself doesn't mean all I have is visions of sunshine and rainbows.
Why is 30 described as the magical age for guys?	Men age like wine; women age like milk. As you get older, your perceived value to society increases. This is because a) men tend to become more attractive, as well as more manly, as they age and b) the experience and stability that comes with being in the labour market for that long is attractive to people. So work out and stay healthy.	I do believe that men generally have an easier time on the dating market when they're older while women generally have an easier time when they're younger. Women are more likely to prioritize confidence, charisma, and success in a partner, and these things grow over time. Men are more likely to prioritize youth and physical beauty in a partner, and these things start higher but fade over time. These aren't absolutes but they're trends. But "just wait until you're 30" is awful advice. First of all, it's not like men in their teens and early 20s (or women in their 30s) are undateable or can't possibly succeed. Plenty do. And second of all, your charisma, confidence, and success aren't going to increase on their own. You have to put effort into this stuff. Thinking that everything will magically change in your favour when you're 30 is naive.
My boss (F 60s) told me “most men don’t read” when she saw me reading. What’s the most ridiculous generalization of men you’ve ever heard?	She isn't wrong. Most people in general do not "read" (assuming she meant literature). She just chose to focus on a specific gender.	My dad's new girlfriend recently told me, "I've only met one other male who can cook besides you." I cook simple meals because the rest of my family would end up eating only take out if I didnt cook. You mean you've only ever met 2 adult men capable of making pasta and chicken?
In your opinion, when does a boy become a man?	When he stops asking childish questions like, "when does a boy become a man?". If you have to ask, you're not one.	When he is swift as a coursing river, with all the force of a great typhoon, with all the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
How do I get guys to realize they’re attractive?	It appears that a lot of men’s self worth is tied to a woman sleeping with them. Do not listen to that advice.	"Talkin' ain't doin'." - Zoe Washburne And I don't use this quote to make an innuendo, but rather to point out that words alone often aren't enough to break through decades of male self-loathing. It takes time, effort, and attention.
Men who are mostly attracted to 'cute' girls, what makes you like that type?	> But it sometimes feels degrading, almost like I'm being seen as a child instead of a woman. No need to feel this way. Men and women use the word 'cute' differently. When a woman says a guy is cute, 9 times out of 10 she means she doesn't want to fuck him. When a guy says a girl is cute, 10 times out of 10 he means he does want to fuck her. For women, the word 'cute' is a way to de-sexualize a guy. They associate 'cute' with kittens and babies and those kinds of things, so when they say a guy is cute, they mean they don't think of him in a sexual way. With men, this is not the case. When they say a girl is 'cute', this means they are attracted to her sexually.	''cute'' when men use it usually means pretty and approachable and somebody they want to cuddle up with and hold hands with. Nothing child like about it.
How does AskMen feel about girls flirting for personal gain?	It is manipulative but one of the harsh realities of life is that people manipulate each other. Say you are in a relationship and want to go out for a guys night but you know your girlfriend is going to be grumpy about it. So what do you do? You buy flowers, order out a nice dinner and clean the whole house. How is that any worse?	Even her bullshit reasoning doesn't hold up. More often than not, these guys realize after the fact that the woman was just using them to get what she wanted. Once they find out that they've been played, they feel like an idiot and their confidence is even lower than it was before.
Fide (The World Chess Federation) holds 2017 Women's World Championships in Iran, so the players must wear hijab (head covering) while in the venue and in public, because it is Iran and that's how they roll. Would you compete or boycott? Your thoughts on this decision?	I live in Afghanistan. Headscarfing is a part of my daily life, and I fucking love it. I have crazy-person curls, so headscarfing is a super easy way to a) blend in, b) respect local sensibilities, and c) look elegant as fuck. So no, i wouldn't boycott. I'm not Muslim, but for me headscarfing is such a non-issue that I can't be bothered to care.	As an Iranian American I don't know who thought holding the WOMENS championship in Iran was a good idea. I can attest to the fact that the country is very safe, but I personally think the laws regarding hijab are ridiculous and it was totally unnecessary to hold the championship there.
Have you ever dated or met somebody who you wish you had met later in life?	I just broke up with my girlfriend about 30 mins ago. She's amazing. I love her so much but I'm 21 and I want to live my life a little before I settle down into something serious.	My ex and I broke up after 5 years not so long ago. We are in our early 20s and our paths just started to drift apart. I think he is a great guy, one of the greatest persons you can meet, but he has a lot in front of him since he is still looking for himself. I wonder how would it work out if I meet him later in life, but I am grateful for the time we had. He was the right person at that point and helped me achieve all I am today. If we meet later perhaps we would never have that time together we did, because we grew up so much at that shared time. I am sorry we didn't work, but I am happy for all the great moments we had while still at the start of our grown up lives.
How can I help my younger brother who's being bullied?	This may not be the wisest answer, but if he just whoops the bully's ass once everyone will hear about it and he'll be left alone the rest of his time at that school. Just one solid punch in the gut. For real though, I'm not about that not fighting back life. You stand up for yourself and if you are attacked you defend yourself. If he's not good with words you may need to give him some lines so he's ready to whip them out.	Well, you should be there for support and life advice. Try to make him understand that scumbags exist everywhere, and he needs to understand he doesn't have to take shit from anyone nor will he have to see these people when he finally graduates from school. Maybe encourage him to exercise, learn how to defend himself?
What is something that many other women do that you can't really relate to or understand?	1) wearing too much clothing. I don't mean wear a bikini all day, but I can't wear more than a layer or two without being uncomfortable. 2) wearing excessive amounts of jewelry. This probably goes with #1, I just don't like wearing lots of clothes. 3) makeup and hair routines. Why lose multiples of hours of sleep just to look like everyone else? AND it costs oodles of money. NO. THANK. YOU. Edit: Funny that some seem so offended by what I said, I was answering a question and interacting positively to those I spoke to in the thread. If you don't like something move on, right? So why the downvotes?	High heels (over 3") as work wardrobe. How do you not end up with aching feet and legs every day?
Do any other sex-positive women still become uncomfortable with excessive nudity in TV and film?	I definitely wouldn't even identify as "sex positive" as I understand the term in this sub - most nudity on TV, IMO, is completely useless, in that it doesn't actively contribute to the plot. If it does, I'm fine with it, but if it's just there for no reason, I find it distasteful and immodest. edit: downvoting for contributing to discussion in a non-offensive way. Stay open to discourse, AW	I'm uncomfortable with it when it's obviously being done in an exploitative way, like I believe there's such a thing as tasteful and realistic nudity, but if it seems like the nudity is thrown in just to be sexually exploitative or edgy or provocative, or if it's extremely one sided, I have a problem with it.
Women who eat organic, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, keto, etc. What health benefits have you noticed and is it expensive to maintain that lifestyle?	My husband and I eat keto diets. We've had a lot of great results in terms of mental and physical health, including increased energy and decreased weight. It doesn't cost more than our old habits. We eat a lot of keto-friendly vegetables and fruit, meats, and cheeses. At first, I thought i was going to miss bread terribly, but it hasn't been bad and we make keto-approved bread when we really want something cake/bread-like. We both actually eat much healthier in general on keto than we did before. Dinner is usually a serving of meat, couple of servings of vegetables, and ice water. It works well for us.	I'm vegetarian and I went vegan/gluten-free/sugar-free/the-worst-diet-ever for about a month because I had an unknown allergy. Going vegetarian, I saved money and lost weight. Fast food is less often an option, even more so when you're vegan. You're also forced to be a bit more creative and learn more cooking. So, naturally, I eat healthier. I feel better, too. The biggest expense is fresh veggies and fruit. I buy frozen a lot, and buy whatever is in season and cheap for the rest. Eating out can be a challenge, but it's good for your wallet and waistline if you don't do it too often. You also get preached at a lot. People care about your health and diet.
What is a fetish that you recommend others try?	r/hematolagnia That is all. PSA: It's not for everyone. ---- Wow, bunch of judgmental people in here. Nothing wrong with it between two consenting adults.	Hate fucking, like where you talk shit to eachother and fight while fucking. I dont know why but i find it strangely awesome when a girl keeps telling me that im an asshole and that i dont deserve this while sucking my cock.
What’s the best way to ask a friend to introduce you to an attractive girl they know?	As a single girl with other single girlfriends, it is ALWAYS a pet peeve of mine when my guy friends ask me to play matchmaker. I don’t mind saying “yeah dude Emily is single” but I will not talk either one of you up to the other. It’s not my job to get anyone laid, and in places where I have matchmade before, I’ve been put in the middle of their flirting (ew), fucking (double ew), and fighting (why would I take sides I like you both). Like don’t expect your friends to make it happen for ya, leave them out of it. Go introduce yourself, show some CONFIDENCE BOOOYAH	Introduce yourself: You spot them together talking. You walk up and say, "HEY!" to the dude you know, then you tell cutie, "I don't think we've met. I'm Pete. Hey." You then ask the two of them what they're up to. You listen for a minute, then excuse yourself so they can get back to their conversation (unless one or both invite you to join them in their plans/activities). The next time you see her, you can say, "Hey! I know you! You were with other dude. I'm Pete. How's it going?"
Ladies, what do you do to make money on the side?	I sell jamberry nail wraps :) i started doing it bc i get a badass discount and I wear them all them time so it just made sense for me financially. It's actually become a pretty awesome 2nd "job". There's really not much involved and they pretty much sell themselves lol	Test food and drink products. $20 for 15 minutes of tasting something and responding to my opinion on a computer. Sometimes you'll get a 4 pack of beer, or a few packs of toilet paper, and get paid $40 to come back and respond. I also got a small part-time job and pay ALL my bills with that job, so all my main income goes to savings and fun.
Guys that have gotten divorced, what surprised you most about the process itself, and the change in your life after is was done?	So sorry to hear all the trouble everyones gone through - what made you think in the first place to get married / love such a person? Weren't the signs visible early on? Even before getting married? Or did their awkward/selfish traits developed overtime?	>I was also absolutely floored by the venom my ex had to get out before she could let go. It went on for years. Ugh, my mother did that after she and my father got divorced. There is an African saying "When the elephants fight the grass gets trampled". People, if you care about your kids, don't trash your ex in front of your kids. S/he may be YOUR ex, but s/he is YOUR CHILD'S parent. Trashing an ex in front of your kid messes them up emotionally and makes them resent you. Lose/Lose
What are some "out-of-character" thoughts you have sometimes?	Whether I like it or not, everything I think is in my character. If I don't like something about myself, I must change it.	I often think about the fact that being hospitalised would temporarily absolve me of all adult responsibility, and fantasise about ways of achieving this. I used to consider superficial suicide attempts or a psychotic break, now I generally think drug addiction. I wouldn't do any of this. I'll continue to be a hard working little member of society who adheres to her responsibilities and doesn't do anything stupid. But it's a nice escapist thought.
What are your experiences with sleep paralysis? If you've never experienced it, what's the scariest nightmare you can recall?	i had possibly the most classic sleep paralysis, i felt a weight on my hip like something less than human size was sitting on me, and i got the impression it was a demon or goblin like thing, like in that one famous nightmare painting with the bug-eyed horse. i could hear like gibberish, garbled demonic voices, and i could see the digital clock, but the numbers weren't right and kept destabilising creepily. i was so freaked out i had to go sleep in a friend's dorm.	I usually get sleep paralysis if I'm taking a nap. It's just awful. I'm screaming on the inside but no sound comes out and I cannot move anything. Sometimes I feel that there is a man in the room, watching me, even though there is no one there. That's terrifying. I have now found that the only way to break it is to not fight it and try to get back to sleep, which isn't easy when you're absolutely petrified.
How do you not lose your boner when you have to put your condom on?	This thread is now locked because you guys wouldn't stop the anti-AW circlejerk after I asked you multiple times not to. This is why we can't have nice things.	This thread is now locked because you guys wouldn't stop the anti-AW circlejerk after I asked you multiple times not to. This is why we can't have nice things.
Men of Reddit, Did you ever get out from a manipulative relationship? if Yes, how did you do it?	First you have to pull you dick out. Then find some place to put it in where you will be more comfortable. Then tell her your seeing someone else and she should get on with her life. Tears will flow accusations will be made and you will walk free. then get rid of the second place. Now after a few months you will have some idea of what you really want.	My old roommate and good friend was in a very manipulative relationship. Won't go into the details, but it was almost depressing to watch. He moved across the country for a job and didn't bring her. I miss him, but he's finally free.
Are really tiny breasts a dealbraker for you?	I dunno op, maybe you should post some pics so we can better answer your question. Seriously though, I like em small. I also like the girl to be a little insecure about it, because relieving insecurities makes me feel good, so long as it's not a constant, self-destructive thing. EDIT: downvotes for an opinion, I love it	I don't really know what "extremely small" means but i do know that there are a bunch of subreddits out there that are dedicated to pics of women with very small breasts. AKA THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTO VERY SMALL BREASTS.

How physically attracted are you to your current partner?	We've only been dating a month so maybe I have rose colored glass on. But I am insanely physically attracted to him. Exactly my type! Very athletic and very handsome! A large majority of my past boyfriends or men that I've dated were just alright and I never had the insane need to pounce on them. Not with this guy! Hope these rose colored glasses never come off.	I'm ridiculously attracted to him and I have been since the first time we met. I always want to be touching him.
[NSFW] What's your favourite way to make your SO go crazy in bed?	When she isn't expecting it, a light poke in the butthole works. She gets pissed and laughs at the same time.	Pick her up and throw her onto the bed jump on top and pin her arms over her head secure her wrists in the cuffs start kissing her slowly, lower, lower, lower pull her shirt up put my lips just under her belly button and... BELLY RASPBERRY THBBBTTTTBBBBB HAAHAHA drives her bonkers
What are the least glamourous parts of being a woman?	I'm glad that i don't have most problems other women have. Like i don't get my period anymore because i take the anti baby pill. (I occasionally get a little blood in my undies but that's okay. It happens only sometimes) My body is almost hairless and if i have hair it's so bright you can't really see it. Don't have any booby sweat cause mine are too small. I only hate it when your shaved pubic hair grows back. It's so itchy especially the part around the hole. Also if i don't clean my face enough before going to bed i get so many pimples..	* Waking up in a pool of blood. * Vaginal discharge *period clots * ingrown hairs from shaving your bikini area * pantyhose wedgies * what I call "poop roulette" aka not knowing whether I have to poop or it's just cramps when I have my period. * (though I'm not personally going through this one) all of childbirth and the afterbirth process.
Alright Ladies - What is on your list of red flags to look for on the first few dates?	How he speaks to the waitress at dinner. If he is polite and leaves a good tip, good sign. Ask him to defend his favorite song. Purposely disagree and see how he argues. I love doing this.	Not respecting small boundaries I set and being rude to servers and baristas are big ones for me. If they push me on small boundaries, I expect the same on important ones.
What is the aspect of a breakup that sucks the most to you ?	So the longest iv ever been with someone is 3 months, and this may come off as shallow or me having a pretty low self esteem. But the part that sucks the most for me is feeling like they'll be able to bounce back and get someone new to date waaaaay faster than me. If im lucky I can find someone new maybe a year later if im really lucky like 6 months. So I cant really date around looking for a good SO well atleast based on my dating history. So getting dumped or having to move on, I feel like well easy for you, you can find someone new so much quicker than me. tldr: Im shallow with low self esteem	The part that sucks worst: You just went through something horrible, and you can't talk it out with the person you're used to leaning on the most.
Anyone else get incredibly turned off when a man talks about his "crazy" ex?	I've only dated one truly clinical example of crazy. Actual mental illness of some sort. But I've also dated a few more that I would also call crazy more casually. The things that I put into this scope. * Codependent level of neediness. * Raging jealousy, lack of trust * Manipulative, mind games, controlling There are many people who hit those marks. Sometimes it's reading too much Cosmo and believing the advice there is useful. Others, they are broken by a history of dating equally awful guys. There truly is a lot of brokenness, or crazy out there. Glad to be married and not still dating.	One crazy ex is ok, i have one and it makes for good stories. If they are all crazy and nothing is ever his fault, either he has bad taste or he is the problem, so multiple crazy exes is a turnoff for me.
What irritates you about buying clothes and the clothing industry and how would you fix that?	How sexist it is. There should be clothes cut for women's bodies in the women's section that aren't feminine, tight, or skimpy. Unfortunately, the only solution is for women to demand clothes like that.	Pockets is an obvious one. The other one is wildly inconsistent sizing! S/M/L, 8,10,12 they are all completely meaningless. One stores 12 is another stores 8. Then you get not only fluctuations within a store but also within the same type of clothing item and sometimes between colours of the same item 🤦‍♀️😩😖. Idk why the can’t be sized according to actual measurements!
People who find out your sons/daughters are not actually yours, what followed in your case?	Child was not mine, led to believe so by wife for 6 years. I was suspicious when the baby had darker skin and I am a European-American, but wife was zealous. When I found out through a paternity test which I had to take with the kid without my wife finding out, as things just got more obvious as she grew, that she wasn’t mine and obviously wife had cheated on me with some thug. I just threw them both out. Fuck that noise. Took wife’s key and forced them out and slammed door. Have ignored everything from them since. Not my kid, not my problem - should’ve thought of that before chasing that ghetto dick. She was trashy and a shitty wife in retrospect so nothing of value was lost.	Well, at the moment she's getting me for child support, so I've lawyered up, petitioned for DNA testing, and am suing the mother for the garnished wages that would've went to taking care of my actual family.
What part of everyday adult life is the worst for you?	The "something's wrong I have to fix/pay for" whack-a-mole someone mentioned. I don't have the energy for it like, AT ALL.	Having to go to work everyday. I don't even hate my job, it's just the fact that I have to go there 5 days a week or I'll starve to death that drives me crazy.
My GF is starting her Army basic training this week. The kicker is that she'll be bunking and showering with dudes. How should I deal with this?	She's going for basic training, not to hook up with her barracks mates. Some guys are going to see her naked or at the very least scantily clad. That's pretty much all that is likely to happen. Why is that such a huge deal?	Honestly what can you do? You can't change her showering arrangements. You can't change who she bunks with. Do you honestly expect her to quit because you are uncomfortable?
I just got an impromptu "wax" while pulling my underwear down to pee because my pad somehow got twisted and the adhesive side got stuck to my pubes. Anyone else have any woman-specific mishaps lately?	I'm 39 weeks pregnant, how much time do you have?? Lol I walk like John Wayne, i have a doctor probe my cervix every 7 days and a bowling ball sitting on my bladder.	I have read the tampon instructions that say "always remove an old tampon before inserting a new one" and thought: what kind of idiot would just keep shoving them up there? A couple months ago, I took out a tampon, then I'm wiping and feel what I thought was a bit of toilet paper but was a string. Surprise! Secret forgotten tampon. No wonder the last TWO times I put one in it was all uncomfortable and difficult. FAIL.
Is your SO your best friend? Does s/he/they need to be?	No, he's not. Not because he's a bad person or anything and I do love him, but I refuse to make someone I'm dating my closest and best friend. It's done damage in the past.	He is one of my best friends and yes, I feel like he needs to be. The friendship element makes it great to be around just doing regular things like shopping. I trust him. I can rely on him. I can tell him anything. He is one of my favorite people. I feel like all of those friendship elements add to the relationship and deepen it.
What's a harsh truth that every man should learn and accept?	Occam's Razor states that you are the most likely cause of the series of unfortunate events that lead you to your miserable blaming of others or "society" for your unhappiness. You are old and out of touch, the children are not the ones who are wrong.	Nobody cares. 90% of the time, no one will ever even notice you. In the gym, on the job, in the bar. This will liberate you more than you think it might.
Found out today I will have to go through IVF to get pregnant. Pretty upset... Any positive IVF/adoption/surrogacy related stories that would cheer me up??	I know I'm a product of it as my parents had me later in their years. (34) It works, but yes it can be an arduous task hearing about it from others. It's still odd that this isn't spoken about more often. While birth control is so often discussed among other topics related to sexual/women's health. (The whole FYI it will be much harder to conceive after 30/32/35 For some women they hit the first "dip" as early as 28.)	I am adopted! My parents told me as far back as I can remember - we had books about "the night we got to pick you up from the hospital," and that stuff. I also am lucky enough to have a close relationship with my birthmom - it's fun to compare our similarities and share our lives, BUT she is not my mom in any sense other that biologically. I truly feel like I won the parent lotto because my parents welcomed my birth family into their lives when I was 12 and we spend holidays together, etc. That's my one big piece of advice - always tell your kid that they are adopted and they are lucky because their birth mother loved them so much she found a family who could care for them.
Ladies who have ever discovered their SO had a fetish that made you uncomfortable, how have you dealt with it?	I don't think both people have to be into the same things if there's communication and boundaries and a good give and take. I had an ex though that if it wasn't his thing (anal), he wasn't into it. I was down on occasion but it was such a shitty attitude that caused me to nope out. We rarely did engage in anything sexual for a long while. I ended up having to have sex with other people during our relationship to fill my need for regular sex.	My ex had a foot fetish and used to ask me to fuck him in this position where I'd sit on his cock and lean back with my feet in his face. I could actually *feel* him swelling up inside me when I did it, but the position did nothing for me and he actually ended up complaining that my feet didn't smell enough. Was a killer exercise for my abs though, so there's that.
To men who are NOT in relationships and DON"T do FWB/casual sex-- how do you guys keep going?	Don't wanna seem inconsiderate or offensive, but if you are sexually frustrated, why don't you have casual sex? If a lack of sex is bothering you, wouldn't that be the thing to fix it? Forgive me if I am being very simplistic, I am a few years younger and not that experienced in that kind of thing.	I don't make having a relationship or finding someone to be with my reason for living. I just live my own life, do what I want. Sometime I wonder if I'm not enjoying my freedom a bit too much which might cause me to not get a girlfriend
People who have been very poor: what is something you've done to get by that impressed even you as a new ''low''?	When I was in college I would take cash withdrawals from my visa (which my dad paid). There was like an immediate 20% interest. I did it anyways. I felt very poor, even though, I wasn't.	When my family was homeless, people would give us t-shirts, pants, etc. But we couldn't afford underwear, so we didn't have it. For over a year. Once my dad got a job, he and mom took the whole family to buy underwear - every single one of us was so excited! It's such a silly thing, but it's stuck with me, and to this day wearing pretty, comfy panties is a luxury I treasure. Having nice undies means everything is okay.
What's the most petty reason you've lost interest in someone?	I met a perfect looking, smart, very well educated, impecably dressed petite brunette. Our conversations were great, the sex was mind-blowing (as well as dick-blowing), and even our wardrobes were a perfect stylistic match. Alas, she was an objectivist and considered Ayn Rand to be a brilliant philosopher.	He was waay into smelling his own shoes. Like the first time I went over to his place he pulled off his shoe and took a nice, deep whiff of it. We're just sitting in his living room, chatting, and out of no where he needs a cleansing breath. Who the fuck thinks this is how you impress a girl?
Bisexual men: are men better than women at hand and mouth stuff?	from my personal experience and from what i've heard from my female friends, men are just better performers than women in the sack. Women are nice when i want to hold something soft and nice smelling but ya'll are lazy (less movement in general) and weak (grip and endurance) compared to men. be thankful you got more squeaky toys strapped to your bodies.	Being women, they only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what? Thirty, forty-five minutes a week? And that's on a good week. How can they be expected to have the same expertise as people who own this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives?
What's something you wish you were taught when you were younger that is predominately taught to men?	Car stuff. Although my brother is 17 and hasn't been taught either, except to just take it in if something is wrong. However, I guess I do not mind so much though	I come from a big family, including 4 older brothers. All of my older brothers were in Boy Scouts, and starting at a very young age, they were doing cool stuff. They would camp out in tents, build fires, go on hikes, fish, and practice archery. As a young girl, I thought this was AWESOME, and asked if I could join Girl Scouts. In the 8 years that I was a scout, we only camped in heated cabins. We made s'mores in the fireplace and made friendship bracelets. I never once held a fishing rod or wielded a bow. We weren't allowed to make fires. But hey, at least I could assemble those pre-packaged foam "crafts" and I knew my way around glitter.
Breaking the bad news: how do I bring up hygiene/weight issues with the ladyfriend?	> Can we however agree that physical fitness is always a positive development though? Well, you didn't say "physical fitness." You said *weight.* And then you clarified by saying her ass is getting big. Please don't insult the larger sized women of reddit and please don't lie to yourself. You don't mean "healthy" and you don't mean "physically fit." You mean what you said - that you want her to lose weight.	Not showering-to me that seems like she is in a fairly severe depression if that is not like her. Try to pull her out of it, find out what you can do to appease the depression. When she comes out of it, the rest could likely fall into place. When we feel good about ourselves, we treat ourselves well. When we don't, well we don't shower or take enjoyment from the things we used to. You are talking about treating the symptoms for your comfort instead of helping her with the cause. Don't just put bandaids on it. If you help her fix the cause, it will make your relationship that much stronger and wouldn't you prefer that she is happy, healthy, and triumphing over her depression and stress, instead of proposing she look and smell sexier for you?
Is there a girl in your life who you're not dating, but you know that you could have sex with?	Several that I could call up and be naked with by tonight if I so desired. None as badass as my gf though.	I have a gf, that being said, there are three or four girls I know have a thing for me and a basically waiting out my relationship (they'll have a long wait). If I called any of them I'm pretty sure I could have them tonight. However, were I to get break up with my gf, I'm convinced that they would not be as interested.
Former RAs, who was the weirdest resident on your hall?	I used to gather the clusters of grass from the lawnmowers and put it in a zip lock back. I’d then place the bag in front of the RA desk so they wouldn’t see it but all the residents would lol. 😲	1) we had a gender neutral bathroom with one stall so naturally people had sex in it. One couple would leave the door unlocked and several of my residents and myself walked in on them several times. 2) I had one international student who would either walk into my room unannounced or bang on my door at any hour of the night and ask me to help them with their laundry 3) the boy down the hall who had a crush on my boyfriend and would try to catch him in his boxers
How did you go from "I am incapable of having any relationships" to having a relationship?	Uhh the answer is alcohol. I go through long stretches of not being able to find a date or the chick I talk to looses interest. I blame myself, become miserable. I'm certain that I want to be single, that I'm just gonna have fun on my own and don't drag anyone down with me in the hell hole that I call my life. I go to a party, have a blast start dancing or just chatting with some friendly person and 10- 15 min later I'm making out with her and I end up not in my bed and spend the day there meet up a couple times and after a bit the chick looses interest. I blame it on me, I become miserable... Basically I get so drunk my mouth runs ahead of my anxiety.	Personally for me I didn't get much until I started doing the things I wanted to do. And in all reality, that was just me working on me. Understanding yourself and your self worth is important when meeting people. I remember getting a relationship was my #1 priority for so long. But once I started to focus on doing the things I wanted to do, I met like minded people.
Men with disabilities, how does your disability affect your dating life?	Somehow, being short seems a little less unpleasant after reading these comments, even though I haven't had a "date" in more than thirty years.	My left ear is deaf. I feel stupid always having to ask girls to repeat themselves. So a lot of time i just smile and nod, or laugh when they do and have no fucking idea whats going on. I once asked a girl if she wanted to meet me at a bar. No idea what she said. So i just said cool and went about my way. Then went there and waited to see if she was showing up or not.
Would you play with a random child at a playground?	I can't wrap my head around the fact that your skin color changes anything to the issue. Edit: Can't help but think the downvotes are racist.	Black guy here! Most of my friends are parents, so I tend to have kids around me at some point, so I get to hang out with them a bunch. If a strange kid ever approaches me and asks to join in, I always find the parent and get permission after explaining what's going on. That way, no rules are broken and adults can rest at ease. What's even better is when I'm at a small, family-friendly festival and everyone just kinda let's their kids do whatever in typical hippie fashion. Then, I usually play for a while, then sit down and talk about life and existence and stuff. I never ignore children. They are the ones that will have issues in the future because of that shit, and I don't want to be the one who sends them over the edge.
So, if no contact with an ex does nothing to get her off your mind, then what?	Gym routine + nutrition program + yoga + just reading a god damn book fiction or non fiction. Fixes everything... pretty sure its what modern day buddha would recommend.	I don't know your situation but, if you two only went out for 2 months, have you maybe considered that this might not be about her? Maybe you are fixating on her to avoid facing other issues you are dealing with. Also, the last line sounds like depression; talking to a therapist might be really helpful for you. Good luck dude!
How old were you when you had your first orgasm?	I was 19. It was my wedding night, and believe it or not, I was a virgin; it was my first time. It was a little bit before I had another one; I think I literally and figuratively just got lucky that first time (and was also super turned on).	Ha Me being a bit of a dummy thought boys could only masturbate. So my bf gave me my first at 23 then I basically copied his tounge motions with my fingers one night and well the rest is history.
If you're out in public by yourself, and you notice a woman crying near you, what do you do?	Ignore, pretend I don't see her, don't look at her, and continue moving. I wouldn't even know what to do or how to help if I *wanted* to.	In most cases I would leave her alone. I have been that women before. In cases like that, I just hope to god that nobody sees me and really want to be left alone. Crying in public is very embarrassing. Sometimes bad things happen while you are out in public and you just cant hold the tears back. Sometimes theres not really anywhere to go or hide and youre stuck.
Older women of Reddit: what kind of things have you noticed happening with your body/mind/spirit as you've aged that no one told you about when you were younger?	I posted this elsewhere, but I felt like I should share. The treatment many women are reporting in their forties are the same way I've ALWAYS been treated as an overweight woman. Welcome to Club Invisible. So glad you finally arrived.	That you continue to grow and be challenged in all these areas. Everyone talked about "when you grow up..." as if it were a place, an age, a mind state. What they didn't ever talk about was the continual challenges personally, emotionally, spiritually, etc. The challenges that continue to happen and how its is relevant to our life as a whole. They didn't mention how we have to challenge our bodies for continual growth either. In sum, lifelong growth was never mentioned.
Hello, dear wonderful women of Reddit. What can Donald Trump say at tonight's debate that would make you vote for him?	There's not anything he could say that would make me not vote for him. Hillary's actions speak much louder than even Trump's words.	That this whole campaign has been to illustrate how far American society has fallen due to the evils of the two party system. He then goes on to outline his actual platform which falls ideologically far to the left of Sen. Clinton and apologizes abjectly for letting his experiment go this far.
What was the most unreasonable reason your parents were mad at you?	Fair enough. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset anyone. Where I'm from people wouldn't really see that as a gendered insult and I didn't appreciate that others might see it differently.	I had washed all the dishes as part of my chores before going to stay with a friend for the weekend. When I came back home (literally when I walked in the door), my mom started yelling at me because the dishes weren't clean...the dishes they had used while I was gone and I would have had no opportunity to clean as *I wasn't home*. When I pointed that out to her, both of my parents yelled at me and grounded me for talking back.
Single ladies, what was your last dating/sex disappointment?	A guy who didn't measure up to my penis size criteria. Kind of sucked to get naked and see him lacking for me. I bailed before anything else happened. Though I was able to score another guy for the night.	This guy tried so hard to get me to go out with him for about a month. I finally gave in and after 3 dates or so, he had started to win me over. On date 6, I told him so and then he confessed that he was still getting over his last girlfriend and thought I could help him get over her since I "looked" like her!!! So creeped out and angry because of the time wasted.
How would/do you come to terms with the fact you're unattractive?	This is such a rich topic and I am so interested in the responses. I am not unattractive. I am social, slender, caucasian, and can be very flirtatious. I feel that I get special treatment and can get away with quite a lot because of my appearance, primarily around men. With that comes a lot of false friendships and unwanted attention. I have always wondered how my life would be different if I was unattractive. What are your experiences being unattractive in terms of how you are treated in the workplace, building friendships, ect.? Struggles? Benefits? What discoveries have you made?	I haven't really come to terms with it. It's a thorn in my side. On good days, I'm able to console myself with the knowledge that the deficit in my looks has forced me to cultivate other qualities that distinguish me from the crowd, but frankly even that's cold comfort when I see people without the aforesaid qualities *still* get preferential treatment just because they're better looking than me.
Ladies, how do you feel about blaming the "Other Woman"?	It's unfair and frankly sexist to only blame the man if the other woman knows she is the other woman. If she knows she is an accomplice in cheating, then both of them are at fault.	I think it depends on the extent of knowledge. I think the person in the actual relationship always holds the most blame, just to clarify that first. As for the other party, irrelevant to gender for me, it goes on a combo of knowledge and action with knowledge. Other party had zero knowledge of relationship? Zero blame. Other party was aware of relationship but did not actively pursue party in relationship? Some blame. Other party was aware of relationship and actively pursued party in the relationship? Much more blame, but with primary blame still on party in the relationship.
What is something you frequently think about but never say out loud, that would seem bizarre or strange if other people knew about it?	"Who's going to sexually harass me now? I'd like to just get my damn lunch" as I try hard not to make eye contact with any men who cross my path	I sometimes think about conversations I'm about to have and try to predict how they will unfold. Problem is I sometimes do it in public and catch myself mouthing or making faces.
how do I come across more interesting to girls?	Ite my g this what you gotta know.. you can't be life of the party if yo gotta get your fragile ass comfortable so start by dropping that ego it's just gassing your ass up. Now you gotta do you my g. That's how it is?	Learn to not be ashamed of sharing your interests. If someone asks "So what do you do for fun?" And you're embarrassed to answer, nothing you say is going to sound intetesting. Be proud of what you like, and that confidence will come through in your words. And be excited! A dull topic can be made interesting when presented by someone who's excited about it. This doesn't apply to every hobby though. Stating that you enjoy skinning squirrels with a confident smile will just make you look like a lunatic.
When do you think you are most misunderstood being a women?	When I'm at the doctor's office trying to make my problems clear and my doctor decides that their education and cursory look at my body means I'm wrong.	People think I can't do something because I'm small. When I take initiative and do something responsible, I get looked at like "aww isn't it cute that it thinks it's people". I get looked at like I'm a baby bunny in a suit. I'm sick of it. I get that you can't tell by looking at a person, but don't assume that I'm incompetent.
Who here CANNOT do a pull up?	This is actually pretty surprising to me. I don't consider myself in shape, but I'm not really that overweight either. (5'10" - 180-190 lbs, it fluctuates often.) I can definitely do pull ups.	>And it wasn't just one or 2 but a good few. I really don't understand how that's possible. Proper Pull-ups involve mostly the latissimus dorsi, and lots of people don't know what that is nor do they practice exercises/movements that really targets/utilizes it (unlike biceps, almost everyone knows what those are and how to build them). Plus, the more you weigh, the more weight those muscle(s) have to move, so that makes it even more difficult, even for those who aren't overweight yet have a decent amount of mass and weak lats. And it also involves some degree of core stability/discipline if you don't want to flop around like a fish out of water trying to stretch your neck over the bar.
What are some weird things that you and your SO do together?	We both watch a YouTuber called Markiplier. If you don't know who he is, he's a gaming guy and he's hilarious. In one of his videos playing a horror game he loudly says "SQUEEEAAAK" when the door opens. So since seeing that, whenever we say goodbye on the phone or whatever we say "squuueeeaak" like markiplier. It's our way of saying how much we care about each other. Don't know why we chose that quote of all things, makes me laugh every time.	We dance during the opening song of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Every. Single. Time. If one of us isn't dancing, we call the other out. We don't dance for other TV shows. Just that one.
What are some signs that you are an emotional abuser?	my ex. broke up w her a year ago and doesnt understand when i still dont want to “talk “ about “what happened”	I think key is to look at patterns in your relationships. If it is unique to one relationship then it may well be the relationship or the other person rather than you. There are, however, many check-lists online about behavior that indicates emotional abuse. [One such](https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/10/13/21-warning-signs-of-an-emotionally-abusive-relationship/)
What do you think about Terry Crews coming out about his experience with sexual predators in Hollywood?	What I think is that between Weinstein, Faraci, and so many others like them turning out to be predators I'm wondering if the entire origin of "rape culture" is a real thing that exists in that elitist bubble that's been projected onto all of society.	Terry Crews is a stand up dude, I hope that his story motivates others to come forward. I have zero patience for predatory people.
How has your clothing style changed as you've aged?	For the first 2-3 years of college I wore mostly t shirts, jeans, and Keds. Now I'm in my last year of undergrad and lately I've been dressing "up" a little more - I'll have my days where I wear a long blouse with black leggings, a cardigan, and ankle-high boots, or I'll wear a sundress with tights underneath. But then some days I go for comfort and wear an oversized sweater with leggings and boots. I've also recently started dressing more "sporty" and going for that whole college girl leggings/Nikes/t shirt and maybe that Northface style fleece jacket kind of look. It's part conformity, part convenience (because then I can go straight to the gym after class), and part comfort because ain't nothing more comfortable than a good, durable, ass-flattering pair of leggings, let me tell ya.	I've got smarter and more groomed. Generally more expensive stuff that's better fitted. In my teens I lived in band t-shirts and jeans.
Millennials, how do you feel about being in the least religious generation ever?	Personal opinion: Religion is a cancer that serves no practical purpose today. I'm glad so many young men and women are ignoring and outright fighting the religious doctrine that has held society and technology and science back for such a long period of time. I read a study, somewhere, that when you tested the morals of Atheists and religious people, the atheists were far more in lined with the morals of *Jesus* than the Christians were. Implying Jesus ever existed in the first place. Religion is fighting for it's life, but it's failing. I love that.	I would like to see something replace it in terms of community. Not sure what exactly. I think church serves this purpose for a lot of people who don't have time or money to get involved in other group activities. Plenty of non-believers go for this reason. There's so much social insulation in todays society already. Everywhere you go bored and anxious people looking at their phones instead of interacting. It's​ depressing but I can't help but do it too.
What's the best argument *against* one of your social/political beliefs?	If there were arguments against my beliefs that I considered "good", I probably wouldn't believe what I do. Edit: to clarify: I'm not saying everything I think is airtight solid, but if there's an argument against them that I consider "good", chances are my thoughts on the matter aren't strong enough to consider it a belief.	I'm a supporter of legalized prostution on personal liberty grounds. But the fact that Amsterdam still struggles greatly with its human trafficking issue despite being the paragon of legalization is worrying.
Has a break in the relationship ever helped anyone?	A break just means "I want to try out someone else, but still have the option to come back to you if it doesn't work out" P.S. This is a male, personal perspective by the way.	My husband and I took a break for 7 months. It was helpful in some ways and damaging in others... in the end we both missed our life together and decided to be back together and we are still together. I can say, I wish I would have never taken the break... there were things that we both did while apart that was damaging to our relationship now. But on the other hand... what if we didn't take a break? Maybe we would have never started to appreciate eachother again...
Lesbians how much flannel do you own?	I'm a gold star lesbian, meaning I've had no sexual contact nor have I made out with a male. Though I did once kiss a boy on the playground when I was younger. I digress. I own zero flannel, and zero plaid. I've got short hair, dress like a tomboy, and own tons of beanies. I also dislike Tegan and Sara so I'm pretty much not following the lesbian rulebook aside from lusting after and having sex with females.	Queer Floridian and it is way too hot here for flannel. Sports jerseys seem to be the gay girl uniform here, and I don't own any because I hate sports.
Ladies! How do you get over feeling ashamed of being “sexual”? With the way media portrays sexually tuned women as “whores”?	Someone once told me, "You're either a b**** or a whore. Pick one." I decided right then that I'd rather be considered a b**** than a whore anyday. My morals keep me on the path that I want.	Damned if you do or don't. Just gotta live your life and own your self. I found people who were so focused on a narrow idea of how you need to be are just not worth sharing shit with.
What was your biggest "She really did like me!" moment, and how did it affect you?	Dude, if you met a girl on Snapchat or Instagram, chances are she's fake or has some *really major flaw* if she's having problems meeting dudes in real life.	At a party in high school, a girl took me upstairs to "give me a tour of the house" that stopped in the bedroom. After we got in there I felt an awkward silence and broke it by saying "Ok i'm gonna go back to the party" and went back downstairs.
FAQ FRIDAY: Does age matter when dating? If you've had to deal with significant age gaps in a relationship, what advice do you have for others?	Short term age isn't a big deal 5+ years difference pre 30. It's only a problem when there's a generation difference. Long term I've notice it's an issue. We grew up watching different shows, listened to different music, are at different stages in our lives. My best relationship has been with someone 1 year younger than me because we shared so much in common. My 4-6 year gap relationships just didn't last.	For me, I wouldn't date younger than 24? I'm turning 27 in Sept and I don't think I have much in common with people still in college and especially people younger than that. The biggest gap I had was when I was 21/22 and she was 18. At the beginning it was fine, she was in college at least and so was I but I feel like I matured faster than she did because I was getting ready to graduate, figure out my life and she was just a freshman. We broke up mainly due to that and the distance. We grew apart. I would view someone differently depending on how out of their range it was. 20/40 that's weird but not crazy. 16/25 is wrong to me, though it may be legal in places.
What is sex like when you and your partner are trying to get pregnant? Are you actively or sub-consciously thinking 'make a baby' ?	Husband and I have been trying for over two years...at first it was really sexy to do it without any sort of protection at all. Then it was a lot of sex while trying to figure out the regularity of my cycles. We've gotten that mostly figured out but now we're just frustrated at our situation. Maybe we'll just adopt?	Both times I got pregnant, we were very actively trying and I was charting. The times we had sex when I was fertile for me was pretty much like normal sex but occasionally I would think "maybe we are making a baby!" That's slightly weird, but didn't ruin it or anything. I do also think since there were certain days we knew we had to have sex to conceive, it felt a little more like a chore than something spontaneous and fun, but once we got into it it was more normal.
Ladies, how do you deal when people ask you unwanted questions regarding your plans for the future?	Phew, lots of angry responses in this thread. I just answer. Examples: When are you having kids? I'm not sure, but definitely not anytime soon. What are you going to do after you graduate? I'll look for a job in [industry]. Then, if you want to, change the subject or ask about their life. People who ask these questions are just curious about you and your life. If you barely know the person, you can be vague, but there's no reason to be rude in response to a simple question. If the person starts judging or prying, you'll need to be more firm, but being snarky right off the bat is just unkind.	Back when my husband and I first got married, we were constantly barraged with, "So... when are you going to have kids?" Then we actually did have troubles conceiving so it got harder and harder to hear the constant questions. Finally, "Well, we would have kids if he could just figure out what hole to stick it in." Shuts 'em right up.
Men of Reddit, which Disney princess would you be?	Best question on AskMen ever. I could be Belle (book smarts, focus on character) or Mulan (just general "I will do what boys do" attitude), but overall I'm probably most like Jasmine. Both looks-wise and personality-wise. And I always felt most into Aladdin out of the disney princes, so that also adds up. I'm a woman though.	Jasmine has a well trained pet tiger, a magical genie friend, and an almost-talking monkey pal. Aladdin seems nice too. What more could you want?
I have grown tired of my daily dinner recipes. What is the one meal that is in your weekly rotation that you/your family loves?	ITT: salt, sugar, fat, garlic. Not to say there's anything *wrong* with that. Add caffeine and you've got all the food groups.	I don't have the recipe offhand, but baked enchiladas are simple and delicious! Basically just need enchilada sauce, cheese, tortillas, and whatever you want to fill them with (I do vegetarian meat crumbles or sautéed veggies, but put meat in them when I cook for the family).
Do you believe you are desirable to the opposite sex? Why or why not?	So far...no. I don't know. Maybe girls are scared my colour, maybe I'm genuinely unattractive to them. I don't maintain a whole lot of facial hair, but perhaps with the tiny amount I do, maybe they find that unsettling. Once they find out I'm British Indian, the second part probably scares them off. The worst part is... I genuinely don't know how to take steps to improve on this, or know what it is that makes me so undesirable to girls out there where I live. So I have no idea what to do. I'm only 17 and already I have no hope in getting a girlfriend. Fun times.	Of course I am attractive. Age 72 Heartbeat: present, variable Comedic quotient: High Handyman skills: Comprehensive Can dance, play bridge, name several operas, drive a tractor, car, motorcycle, boat, but not an airplane. Still have all my teeth, and am smarter than the average bear. (Average bears are prety dumb though.)
Women who were in toxic relationships where they loved the other person, how did you finally leave?	Abuse doesn't have to be physical to justify leaving. Emotional and verbal abuse is terrible too. If some one fucks with your self esteem, belittles or disrespects you, gtfo asap. They need individual therapy. Some people will never change though. Think "Would I let a stranger insult me? No. Then why am I letting someone who supposedly loves me do this?" Love doesn't make you walk on eggshells or cause anxiety/stress. Please confide in a friend or family member and get out safely.	I was finally more afraid of being with him than being without him. When you're afraid of being alone, the other person has a gun to your head.
Men of Reddit who didn't go/dropped out of college, what are you up to?	Pewdiepie dropped out of college when he was 18 or 19. Now he's the most subscribed Youtuber with 54.5 million subs, his net worth is $90 mil, and he's been in a relationship for 5 yrs. the b/tch isn't even 28 yet.	Currently am helping out with the family business. Structural welding. Worked on quite a few bridges in the SoCal area. As well as some buildings and a lot of other random stuff that needed welding. As well as misc. bank work, such as assembling/disassembling bank vaults, delivering/removing safes, safe deposit boxes, under counter units, ATMs, Night drops, TCDs and a whole bunch of other random banking equipment. Edit: added a word
Is it okay for my 21 year old brother to be in a relationship a 15 year old girl? Should I do anything about it?	He's in a relationship with a minor. There's a word for people who do that. It's not a pretty one.	15 puts him at risk of ending up on the sex offender registry. Keep away from the jailbait, they have nothing to offer but inexperience and drama anyway.
What are some things men don't tell women?	How most women will never understand real responsibility or real consequences because their pussy functions as a get out of jail free card	Someone complimented my shirt on campus today. It was my favorite shirt before that, now I practically consider it my only shirt
Any other butch straight girls out there? Does it affect your interaction with guys?	I don't know if I'd call myself "butch" but I'm not girly. I think your mom is correct, most men prefer feminine girls. I don't want to have to change everything about myself to find a bf.	I'm pretty "butch" I guess. Short military style haircut, I'm *IN* the military, and I'm assertive and sometimes loud. (I'm hard of hearing, so I don't always know my volume.) I've been married for a long time to a wonderful guy who is soooo used to me being hit on by women. Everytime I transfer to a new duty station, it takes about three days of sideeye before someone asks me outright if I'm gay. I usually tell them to fuck off - which admittedly doesn't help much. But there are plenty of guys who like me for ME. Good partners don't want someone who isn't themselves, they want you for **you**, whatever that is. Those people are out there, I promise.
What is the juiciest piece of drama at your workplace/class ?	There is a younger couple (married) that I work with. The other day she told everyone that she was taking her son out for Halloween. I sat in my car and saw her get in a different car with two other guys. One of them opened the car door for her. And she giggled laughed. Her husband has no idea.	I speak Spanish well enough to eaves drop, and the Latina cleaning ladies aren't aware of this. Last week they were talking about a lady who was pregnant and apparently she didn't mean to be. The baby daddy flaked on her and now she's left unmarried and going to be a single mom. Another lady was complaining a couple weeks ago about her daughter's boyfriend buying her daughter a puppy for her birthday, which has really become the mom's responsibility to care for. Very boring gossip, but a good opportunity to exercise my Spanish vocab.
Women who have dated someone only for them to choose someone else over you: how did you manage at the time, and how are you now?	I remember dating a guy for a few months and even going away with him for the weekend. I felt like I was almost being love bombed the attention he gave me. Ultimately, he chose a woman with an illegitimate child that was just an infant. What I took away from the entire encounter was he really wanted another kid and she was his way forward. I dont for a moment think that I would have been better for him because I would have been a stepmom and I have realized since then I truly don't want that level of responsibility.	I was devastated and deeply insecure at the time. It left me pretty traumatized and unable to trust people for a while. Eventually I realized it was for the best though. He wasn't that great and the person he chose over me was a better match for him. I ended up meeting my now-spouse just a few months after that breakup.
Moms of AskWomen: what is something about having kids that nobody tells you?	How much I *wouldn't* miss my previous life. I had a great career, where I was superstar, before I had kids. I don't think twice about it. The career, the friends, the going out, all of it...I recognize it as a season in the cycle of life. My new life is infinitely better.	The "4th trimester"- basically that a newborn is still more like a child in utero for the first 3 months, where they'll just want to be constantly attached to you and to eat. Also, that you're not a bad parent for hating the baby phase. I know some parents are all about it, but I love having a tantruming, willful toddler way more than the baby stage.
Women who took their husband's name and subsequently divorced, what did you do about your name?	This is sort of from a different perspective (I wrote my own as well in another comment), but my SO is very irritated that his ex wife is still using his last name. It's interesting to think about the male perspective on this - it never crossed my mind until he mentioned it. So, I've started to believe that maybe it should be decided in the divorce by *both* parties whether she keeps his last name or not.	I will have to make this decision in a couple of months! I do like my married name and know many women who have kept it post divorce, but I am ready to move on. But I'm not sure I want to revert to my maiden name either. It was suggested to me that I take another family name, something way back from the family tree. I like that idea.
Who here has had a vasectomy?	I have a friend who had one because he never wanted kids. Anyway he was telling me about it (going from memory on timeline so I may be off some), and he said that it was supposed to be pretty well all healed up in about two weeks but he wasn't and it was taking quite a while to heal. Anyway after about the fourth week, he decided to try and give it a go by himself. He said that as he was blowing his load it felt like someone had hit him in the balls with a hammer.	I have. do it again in a heartbeat, Very little pain. Plus the wife agreed to help with the check ups after when they check to see how the little swimmers are doing (or not doing) ;)
Fellow gents, what's the most hurtful thing you've overheard someone say about you?	I overheard my ex girlfriend (who had left me and got with my old best friend since kids) and other ex best friend taking the piss out of me trying to be friends with their clique I got kicked out of, it wasn’t what they said.. more this being the final straw that broke the camels back. Got back at her though, fast forward five years I ended up at a party with her and her friend, I led her on all night then fucked her best friend in front of her :)	Threads like these are why I discourage people from the "nobody ever judges you, really" school of reassurance. If they bank on it, they're always one overheard comment away from their mental defenses falling apart completely. Better to accept that some people are judgy assholes and that their opinion doesn't matter at all.
Men Who Pack Their Lunch, What Do You Pack?	I just pack whichever Marie Callender or Boston Market I grab from the freezer that night. If I'm feeling cheap it might be a Banquet Mega Meal.	Today I have leftover steak and potatoes from last nights dinner. Yesterday I had leftover biscuits and gravy from the weekend. So, leftovers I guess.
Women who haven't been in a relationship in a long time, do you feel uncompelled to remedy that?	I've more or less defaulted to it. I've gained weight, hit 30, and am therefore finding ways to be content with being forever alone.	Pretty much, yeah. Singleness is a comfy enough default for me, so I don't see it as something that needs to be remedied.
Guys of Reddit, why are you so nervous and speechless around a very beautiful girl yet you obviously want to talk to them?	Most women value your status and not you as an individual. That is a truth that is dark to know. That said, you should probably try to make her laugh?	Because when I see a beautiful girl I automatically assume she'll want someone better looking than my self. I would love to go approach her, but it feels like it'll be a definite rejection and embarrassment. So I'd rather save myself from damaging my already low self esteem.
How did you find the haircut that fit you?	Go to the affluent town near you and find a salon (that's not one of those chain salons like Supercutters). Ask for an advanced-level stylist. They're paid to know what looks good on you. You get what you pay for. Go a barber and you will look like you get your hair cut at a barber.	There was an upscale barber shop at my college that was run by attractive women and only cut men's hair. They also gave you free beer while you waited, which was awesome. So I went in one day and asked them to do whatever they think would look best. That was 8 years ago. Been rocking that same hairstyle ever since. I'd recommend you do the same and go to a place that specializes in men's hair.
What is an advice you would have given to your 18yr old self?	Stop being nice to girls and treating them with respect. That's not what they want to begin with, and the ones that are actually worth the effort are few and far between.	"Lose the bitch you're with and take this list of girls you're too stupid to realize are into you. They tell you as much later in life. Now go."
Men who have had a vasectomy, how did it improve, or destroy, your sex life?	Improved incredibly. Im 27 and about to bareback an 18 year old on this lazy Sunday with no worry of pregnancy. How can it get any better than that? Single, no kids, no wife, no worries. Life is perfect.	SO doesn't need to take hormonal birth control anymore and her sex drive has improved, which has made my sex drive improve, which has made me fill her up more frequently, which makes the two of us very happy.
Fellow women who've had their drinks spiked, what does it feel like and what are some warning signs?	Not a woman but feel this belongs here. This was a long time ago(22yrs) my very pretty ex and I went to a house party. I had 2 beers and a mixed drink someone made me. We were no stranger to strong drink, so 3 drinks was nothing. One minute all was well.. The next I couldn't not keep my head up. Woke up next to the couch hours later with my head pounding and absolutely no memory. I guess they wanted the boyfriend out of the picture. I've told this to people over the years and they all say maybe your memory just got scrambled. You probably had more than 3 drinks. Just sayin it happens to guys too.	No warning signs from what I remember. One moment I'm fine dancing with this guy and some friends, the next moment I'm throwing up in an Uber with people I don't know. Then, the next morning, I wake up with a bunch of people around me and I have no idea who they are or where I am. Lucky for me, they were a group of people who stopped this guy from taking me out of the bar, but it could've ended up way worse.
How have you fucked up 2015 this far?	I kissed a girl at the new years party and didn't get her number ;_; Then i remembered unless she's bisexual it wouldnt work in a couple months anyway blah	I thought I could sleep with only a pad last night because I hadn't started really bleeding yet- it was mostly just a muddy color when I went to the bathroom and wiped. Except I have the flu and am having bad coughing fits. This morning I woke up and coughed before even moving or getting up, and SPLOOSH. There goes that pair of panties. :|
What is your ideal amount of sleep? How many hours do you actually get?	Ideal, 8. I get 6 hours if I'm lucky. Every now and then I can manage to go back to sleep for another hour.	Minimum of 8, 10 is a good night sleep on days off Could easily sleep for like 12 hours if I've finished a night shift or am jetlagged lol My bf thinks I sleep too much lol, I probably do tbh but in the other hand I just really like sleep

How many pillows do you use?	One under my hips and one under my face so I can bite it. Wait, we ARE talking about pegging, right?	Generally two, but some nights I'll take one away if I want to sleep on my chest. I have a third pillow ready if I want to sit up in bed to read.
After how many dates did you become a couple ?	I think it was 2 dates. He wanted to unlock the girlfriend achievement pretty quickly and I thought he was joking! Now I know that when he wants something he tends to just go for it and I guess he saw Something in me he wanted to keep around a bit. :)	My boyfriend and I both accidentally tricked each other into becoming an official couple on our first date. While on the date, he innocently made a comment about how he couldn't believe I'd only had three boyfriends in my life. He himself was/is the third person I've dated, so I teasingly asked if he was counting himself as the third boyfriend already. He got adorably flustered and said "Only if you'll have me." I said "Of course," and we kissed and had ice cream : )
Asexual women of reddit- when and how did you realize and come to terms with the fact that you are asexual? How did that affect your relationship and relationships going forward?	I was about 12 when I first heard the word and it just made sense to me. Kept it close to my heart since. Been in a few relationships, none of which really respected my opinions of sex (nothing traumatic, just me pushing my consentually picking my battles. I decided maybe two years ago I didn’t want to keep making myself uncomfortable anymore. I’ve been single since. I hate every second of it. I’m not sure how other women or men find pride in this sexuality. I don’t think I ever will. :/	I forget how but I came across a website describing it while in college and almost cried from relief that other people felt the same as me and I wasnt just broken. It's made me much more comfortable with my limits for physical intimacy with partners and on the flip side, I've also realized that I'm interested in people other than men as romantic partners.
Ladies, what are you sick of seeing on dating profiles?	Exotic travel photos, anything materialistic, Camo, or pics with their kids in them. I wish you only got ONE photo for a profile. Get really tired of album overload.	The one that always bugged me was 5 group photos, and then wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses in the only solo photo. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU ARE???
What's the most sexist thing that has happened to you?	Once a woman made fun of me for having a girl's bike (which wasn't even true). I thought of making fun of her for having a girl's body, but thought better of it.	Shortly after my 18th birthday, the United States government forced me to sign up to the selective service and put my name on a list to be drafted, else I faced jail time, fines, and other penalties. I was forced to sign up because I am male, females are exempt from signing up.
Women who've gone from overweight to fit: How did you do it? What finally motivated you?	Respectfully, I do not conflate losing weight with "fit". I am overweight, but am incredibly fit and strong. As a dancer and dance instructor I can run circles around women much skinnier than I am. Fitness /= lighter weight.	I had always been slightly to very overweight, and when my daughter was born, I decided I was going to make sure I lost the baby weight. I started exercising every day, using the elliptical and a couple dvds I found at TJ Maxx. By the time I lost all the baby weight, I had become addicted to exercise. I just had to find what I liked, which was exercise dvds. I lost almost double the baby weight and I've continued to workout, and I've kept the weight off for the past seven years. I weigh what I did in eighth grade.
Do you think that female characters are judged more harshly than male characters?	That's because they're often written as complicit but let someone else do the actual dirty work (Skylar, Lady McBeth...). People don't like that.	I think they have the same problem other uncommon/minority characters have, which is that they're treated like they're supposed to represent ALL members of their group instead of just themselves. White male protagonists are individuals; everyone else has to be an emblem of some kind. So they get slammed for not being a good representation of their group, or people project their issues onto them, or they otherwise get a bunch of baggage attached to them.
Could you see yourself living in a "tiny house"?	I bet those are death traps. Im just guessing but i bet the people building these cut corners. If I had to live in something small I'd just get an RV	No. I feel cramped in a small apartment. I would go nuts in a tiny house. I do enjoy looking at them, but I wouldn't want to live in one.
What's a ridiculous rule your parents had when you were young?	Growing up, the rule via my Atlanta, Georgia retired drug enforcement cop parents was I wasn't allowed to date black guys because 'that's not what we do in this family'. Now I'm only ever date black guys, pale skin doesn't do it for me.	Mine gave me a curfew but kept pushing it back later and later - first 11, then 12, then 1. I didn't socialize much and certainly didn't party, and I got the impression that they set the first curfew expecting to have to rein me in, and then got worried I wasn't social enough so they'd push it back to try to get me to go out more. One time in my senior year I did stay out past midnight. My mom called me *losing her shit* that she wanted me home even though she knew where I was and my "curfew" wasn't passed yet. I didn't have a car, and my friends weren't ready to leave to I had to beg a boy I barely knew for a ride, basically put myself in a more dangerous situation due to my mom's anxiety.
Men of reddit who cheated death by missing a flight, calling in sick, missed bus. What happened? Did it change the way you live your life?	Couple of occasions of passing a street away from a stabbing attack last year when I was living in Jerusalem, one time at Mahane Yehuda market, the second time in the Old City. Oh, one more stabbing on a Tel Aviv-Jerusalem bus I could have taken. In all honesty, I couldn't care less, as most Israelis do. Shit happens all the time and as long as it doesn't touch you.. one is not inclined to dwell too much on the "what if"s	A guy I once knew was responding to a gas leak, tried to squeeze through a traffic lighted junction, but didn't make it to the line in time and had to wait for a full rotation to green. Pulled up at the address, and the building blew up as he exited the vehicle. Had he have made it through the lights, he'd have been literally knocking on the door of a bomb as it went off. I don't believe he changed at all, and shrugged it off to being extremely fucking lucky.
How did you get over your ex knowing that they are fine and already over you?	I made a conscious decision to move on, satisfied with the knowledge that better men and bigger dicks await me. He would have held me back. He was never going to leave Edmonton. He was a bar manager and he had a tiny marketing business and he lives with his mother at 27 (not that that's inherently bad, but it was just laziness on his part - he had more than enough to move out.). He had no direction. I did love him, but he was no good for me and didn't treat me well. I can't stand for that. Look at your ex's flaws. Look at the reasons that he couldn't possibly satisfy you long term.	I was upset and working on getting over it for 3 months, then saw all his wedding pictures online. Did the math and found out how long he'd been cheating. Then I got pissed off. The anger faded to apathy, and it's a really great feeling.
What new things did you learn about your SO or your relationship after moving in together?	I haven't officially moved in with my boyfriend just yet. That's happening next week! 😄 but I've basically been living with him the past two months. I haven't really learned anything new since I started going to his house after work instead of my own apartment and my dog is now living at his house . . . Eh, turns out he really enjoys my pup and is so sweet. He bought her treats and is treating her new tricks. I wasn't expecting that. Besides that, nothing else was new.	I found out mine is a hardcore snuggler in his sleep. I mean, ***hard core***. Like, arms and legs wrap around me like vines. It isn't a bad thing, most of the time, it was just unexpected He also found out that my socks can end up literally anywhere. For whatever reason I can't control them
[Serious] College educated of Reddit, what is your degree, why that one, do you have a career in a field regarding that degree, how long did it take to get a job after graduation?	Bsc (Hons) Computer & Communication Systems. Couldn't decide if I wanted to do comms, hardware or software. The recurring smell of burning ICs pt paid to the hardware, and software was piss easy so went into software. I'm now Software Architect, working my way up from trainee programmer. Lined up a job in the final year about 12 months before graduation. Degree was 4 years and year three was full time working for IBM.	Degreed in aerospace engineering from Wichita state. Yes, I'm working at an airplane manufacturer, though most of my lessons aren't needed for the job... I got the job the September before I graduated, after 4 years of interning here. Went with this path because I first wanted into mechanical engineering, but the coursework seemed too generic and uninteresting to me... I've always been into airplanes, maybe on account of my dad's indoctrination, since he worked at the faa his whole life
How do you avoid feeling lonely as a single adult? When you do feel lonely how do you get over it?	I go into the next room and say hi to my wife Edit: my bad, I didn't realize what sub I was on. Sorry for the rudeness.	I'm a pretty solitary person, but do get lonely sometimes and it can be tough. Today I'm having a bit of a lonely day, Sundays can usually be tough as this is the day I have the most downtime and will think about it. I go on Reddit and talk to people, try to immerse myself in something that will make me not dwell on it like reading, go for a walk and listen to a podcast, or just get out of my place for a bit.
My dad just bought about $90 worth of cheese for Christmas. In what ways do your parents or family members tend to go a little overboard for celebrations?	Wow! That must be a lot of cans of spray cheese. (For the non-US Redditors: Only a tiny, tiny percentage of Americans eat spray cheese, although I'm sure most have tried it. We have artisanal cheeses made in a huge number of states are are equal to the best cheeses of the rest of the world)	On Thanksgiving, my mother in law brought six 2-liters of soda in flavors my husband and I enjoy, "In case there wasn't anything we like to drink." Thanksgiving was at me and my husbands house.
At what age did you find your randomly placed thicc (black) hair on your face?	Since my teens. I have a ton of blonde hair on my face too, I shave it off. It helps my skin a ton and my makeup looks better. I have black hairs on my chin that I tweeze like every freaking day lol.	This makes me laugh because I was just saying to a friend yesterday that it seems like every single woman on earth has one pesky hair on her face (usually on the chin). Anyway mine is also on the chin, just hanging out right at the bottom. I can't remember when I got it, but I think I was around 20-21? That's when I *noticed* it anyway. Also is it just me or is it incredibly painful to pluck it? My nipple hairs are lovely and soft and come out with zero pain. I can even pluck them out with my fingers sometimes. My chin hair is a stubborn wiry little bastard who hurts like hell every time I pluck him. I hate him so much.
I'm going to have my period on a 30 hour flight to Sydney. What bad timing stories do you have?	I've spent the last week looking for a decent moisturiser since I've run out, and finally caved and dropped £10 on a really decent one with SPF20 in it! Today, I got sent a sample to blind product test for two weeks... of facial moisturiser -_- at least this means I won't have to buy any for about half a year or so, but still, gutted by the timing.	* I got braces put on the morning of school pictures in 6th grade. I finally got them taken off the day after school pictures in 9th grade. * I had to complete a huge two-day test online for a big job opportunity. Unfortunately the 2 days of the test also happened to be my college graduation weekend.
Guys who turned their lives around/started late, what's your story or advice for fellow guys in that situation?	I was in a similar situation as you, I finally realized that this way of living was unacceptable and I had to change. I went back to school and started to change my ways slowly but surely. Waking up early trying to exercise not speaking to my negative parent who had no idea how the world works and trying to surround myself with more positively thinking people. A change of environment can work wonders, I would recommend moving out tbh your dad and his gf aren't doing you any favors and are most likely preventing from reaching your full potential with their negative talks and lack of support, that is a recipe for failure. Just get away bro.	Wow you're probably gonna hate me after this reply but it sounds like you're not even trying. It seems like you are placing blame on others as well. Your family helped you get a car and they are letting you live with them. You bet your ass you better put away that ONE spoon in the sink. As far as going to school, you are already having doubts. How can you go back to school if you are under the impression that it's not going to help you in the first place? Change your attitude, OP. If you are going to bag groceries at minimum wage you better be the best dam good grocery bagger out there. A strong work ethic takes zero skill.
After 12 years of marriage, I am now separated and wondering - what do I do with my life now?	If you are actually good looking with a great career you'll fuck a lot of women. It just a buffet out there.Get on Tinder and see the magic. Date women in their mid 20s, you're just 33 ,still pretty young. The kid thing can be a dealbreaker when the relationship gets serious,but you can still get laid	My only comment passing through is don't lose sight of your daughter. She will one day be a woman and how you are with her now will greatly impact your relationship with her in the future as well as her relationship with men. Date as much as you like but don't expose her to it. She is going through enough already and doesn't need to worry about losing daddy. Keep her prioritized. Dump any woman who shows the tiniest bit of jealousy for your time spent with your girl. If I were single I would absolutely love to date a man with children. I love kids! But you want someone who respects that it is you and your ex wife raising your daughter and not someone who tries to compete. Best wishes.
men of reddit, is sex any different if the girl is significantly taller than the guy?	Never had sex. Height is no barrier to relationship. I'm 5'8" and that is considered tall in Southeast Asia where I run around in.	Doggystyle is a little more difficult because her legs are longer so her hips are higher than yours, so she'll have to sprawl out a little wider for your bodies to align.
How have your gaming habits changed as you've grown older?	I played up until PS2 came out. Then I discovered vagina at 16, and dropped the hobby all together. I still end up buying a console every gen, but they just collect dust. I've never even played a game on my PS3. It's just a pricey Netflix machine basically. Or I connect my external drive to it and watch movies. I'll sometimes play flash version of old NES games. But that's about it. New games just don't seem entertaining to me. They just all seem that same. Oh look, another first person shooter. Oh look, another Call of Duty. Much like movies and TV, nothing is original anymore. Resident Evil 2 was the last really entertaining game to me.	>Do you still game? Yes. But I probably only buy 3-5 games per years these days, and may never beat any of them. >Have you ever felt a pressure to stop playing because gaming is, in the eyes of some, an activity for children or teens? Not in the slightest. All of my friends and coworkers play some manner of video game in their spare time. Even the most stolid "video games are stupid" lady I know has Candy Crush on her phone. >How do you respond to that perception? By laughing it off. There are way worse ways I could be spending my free time. As I've gotten older, I've simply learned to split my time more equitably, and naturally games take a back seat to other priorities. But they are still my main hobby when I have the free time to enjoy them.
What's the most enjoyable PS1 game that you played?	PS1 was really the last time I played games back in high school. Twisted Metal 2. Resident Evil. Bloody Roar. Parappa the Rapper. Tomb Raider. Darkstalkers. Street Fighter Alpha. Back then I obsessed over game art as much as I did comic book art. But, once I discovered girls and started getting laid, I stopped caring about games. Which was natural. Back then games were intended for kids and teens. Not grown-ups that compared them to movies. It was something you grew out of.	All of the Crash, Spyro and FF games for the PS1 are fantastic. I still replay them every now and again.
How common is it to have sex on the third date?	I think people have sex by the third date; it provides a decent baseline. If she isn't going to have sex with you by date three, you can probably assume that she isn't that interested in you and is stringing you along for free food and attention. It provides a more solid line to cut someone off by. Similarly, if men cannot commit to three dates even for sex, then he is probably not that interested in a real relationship. Again, a useful thing to measure by.	Depends on where you live. Here in Norway its pretty common to have sex first, then go on a date if you like each other.
What was your most embarrassing "dumb kid" moment?	My wife explained dermographia to me early in the morning, and I tried to see if my skin had that property. In a bleary state, I gouged a foot-long bleeding gash in my arm with my own nail -_-	I politely declined shrimp at a cocktail event when I was about 8. I had never seen shrimp before as my family was not into seafood and my mother a vegetarian. My declining statement went along the lines of "No thank you miss, I don't eat cockroaches" southern sincerely and manners included.
How are you handling the news that if we, as a species, don't make some pretty significant (and highly unlikely) changes fairly soon, we probably won't survive much longer?	I see it as a good thing. The human race doesn't deserve the planet after what we've done to it. We certainly don't deserve a new one (Mars One / Artemus Generation). We wouldn't even be alive if not for our technology, as we're not exactly ferocious attackers or even capable of defending ourselves. Heck, we're not even capability of carrying our young to term (which should be around 2 years old, except that the female body isn't capable of sustaining more than around 9 months so we end up with helpless young that need HEAPS more constant attention and care than pretty much any other animal). I don't know if we can make the changes required to keep our planet and stay alive, we're too pigheaded for that. So yeah, time for the humans to die out and to let nature take the planet back.	I’m taking action. I’m currently studying environmental biology and work in ecology research so I’m basically dedicating my career and life to it
What's the biggest age gap in which you could consider to be in a relationship with someone? 10? 20? Maybe less or more?	As a guys i always calculate: My age/2 + 7. 20 year old: 20/2 + 7=17 minimum Age to Date; 25 year old: 25/2 + 7=19.5 (you can deice if you want to round up or down) ;) 30 year old: 30/2 + 7=22; and so on. seems to work :D	I think my answer will change with age (hence the half your age + 7 rule). I could go down to 18 at the youngest, provided they were out of high school though, and don't think I would consider someone over 25. A 30-year-old seeking out a relationship with a 20yo college kid (me) would skeeve me out *bad*.
What’s a fashion tip every man should know (modified from AskWomen) ?	After browsing reddit for years I’ve learned that baggy clothes, low-sagging pants, and beat up shoes are all pretty good things to wear.	Fit and matching of colors is more important than brand. Also, in the warmer weather, roll up your dress shirt sleeves. If you’ve got some forearms, most woman I know tends to dig that look. I’m sure some ladies looking at this will back me up on that.
Men who never had a relationship until a "late" age, what do you wish you knew?	That actually seems to be the norm these days. I'll throw out some things I think might help. * Don't freak out about period stuff, whether it's over a pad/tampon or waking up in a pool of their blood. * They're going to steal some of your clothes. * Women 'logic' is different from men logic. It's frustrating but it won't ever change. * Don't go grabbing at their tits all the time, I know they're awesome but restrain yourself. * Even though they're going to get stupid from hormones every so often *never say it's just their hormones* even though it is. * learn to cook, modern women usually suck at it. If you want to eat good food you're going to have to make it yourself. * use protection	First serious relationship happened around your age, OP. I wish I knew then that a little bit of openness with your feelings and risk-taking can go a long way. I thought that fear functioned as a way to protect yourself from harm or rejection, but sometimes it keeps you from living your best life.
Have you ever had an experience with someone "gatekeeping" your stress levels? How do/did you deal?	Not a woman, just a dude passing by and could really relate to this in a way. I gatekeep myself essentially. I think to myself why complain about my struggles when there are others that are having it worse? Who am I to complain. So I just put up with it because it just doesn't fucking matter anymore.	My parents grew up in near-poverty, and my mom had a "when I was a kid in China..." story for every complaint I raised about school. I respect the hard work they put in to provide me a materially comfortable life, but listening would have helped a lot.
What's your weirdest menstruation story?	O_O;; *shudder* I hope all of the ladies in this thread never have to experience anything even approaching the severity of what's featured here.	Here's mine: I had a massive cold at the same time as my period. I sneezed, and my whole body contracted, which led to a large discharge of blood (even though I have my menstrual cup on). I was alone at home, and actually yelled to the walls "I HATE EVERYTHING!!!!"
How will the ban on Muslim countries affect you?	I'm Muslim. Much of my family lives in Afghanistan and Pakistan. At the moment I think Pakistan is not on the list but I have no doubt it will be soon. How will it affect me? I'm going to buy a gun as soon as I can. I'm not going to tell anyone I'm Muslim but I'm going to fight for voter awareness so that 2018 is the year we stop trump. I'm never going to forget how it feels when your own country tells you you're violent and inferior.	I'm Muslim, but I'm an American citizen and not from any of the countries that are banned. I went to the masjid last night and there was a lot of anxiety. I don't know. I just hope this is where it ends.
I feel like I'm 24 going on 18.. Need help on how to snap-to and grow up?	Finish your bachelors in business and lift weights. This combo will earn you more respect than you ever imagined possible.	Set reasonable, defined goals and hit them. I will find full-time employment in 3 months, not, I think I want a full-time job. I will move out in 6 months, not, It'd be nice to have my own place someday. So on and so forth. As for your interested and hobbies, don't worry about that to much. They are there for you to unwind from the grind of real life. If it's video games, so be it. Also, ask your dad to give you a kick in the ass. Metaphorically of course.
What will make you lose respect for a woman?	Posting her nudes online or doing sexually provocative live streams to make money. Additionally, being a Feminist. Also, if she hates prequel memes. Edit: Dang, a lot of people really hate prequel memes.	If she doesn’t do as she preaches. Example: some of my friends have a group chat where they share nudes of guys they are sent. Most of these are sent after being asked to. They got real mad at one guy who sent a friends nude to someone else after he found out she had done this to him.
"Why are you so nice to me?" Why are so many people dating mean people?	I'm a fat woman, middle aged. Never been in a relationship, but I have been on a few dates. Every date I've gone on, the guy has acted appallingly in some way -- ignored me, insulted and argued with me, or tried to grope me. I can't speak for men, but, as a woman, unless you're attractive enough to have guys feel they need to woo you and compete for you, yes, being with someone awful is often the price of having a social life.	Because they've never known any better. > (like tidying when you're a guest, bringing over food, cooking meals, picking up small gifts etc). I've only had one girlfriend that did things like this. The first time I came home and she had cleaned my apartment my first thought was that she was about to break up with me, and the clean place was to soften the blow.
What did you think of your partner when you first met them?	I thought wow he is so adorable and shy and oh my god what if he hates me in person I'll have to delete my reddit account and never come back to /r/askmen	During a very boring lecture: Huh, this girl is really hot and isn't afraid to show some cleavage. And she doesn't seem to speak my language so that's perfect. Better start to "randomly" sit next to her and chat her up. Approaching 8 years now.
In your opinion, how attractive does a guy have to be to get approached first/hit on/asked out by a woman?	For me to go up to a guy I would have to find them decently attractive. Like, a 7 at least. The last guy I went up to I would have rated him a 7-8. He ended up being mine for the night :) Edit - Should add he was 6'1" & white. Tall & white is my favorite mix. Literally had my eye on him from the moment I saw him.	He has to be well above average *for that woman*; not all women have the same tastes and preferences and level of sobriety.
Women who can't have kids (whether you or your partner is the one who can't,) what is the most offensive thing someone has said to you?	I’ve never had anyone be offensive in their comments or questions to me but rather thoughtless questions. The question I get the most is, how many children do you have? In my reply, and knowing that my reply will get a reaction, I smile and say, I’m blessed with no children. Life is magnificent without children and Life is magnificent with children.	The most hurtful one (different than offensive) is "You'll never know real love unless you're a mother." I love my family immensely and it hurts to have people say that the love I am capable of is merely superficial and without depth. The most offensive one might have been an off-hand comment someone made to me about how men would never ultimately want a woman who can't get pregnant; they'd just cheat on her with a *real* woman. Yikes.
What do you like to buy when you "treat yourself"?	Take away Whiskey Car mods Xbox games Tattoos. Got my yearly bonus from work last week and got a chance to treat myself. Spent it on a full day tattoo session.	Expensive takeout food, like fancy sushi or something like that. Usually on a Friday night when I'm feeling good but don't have any plans. I'll pick it up, fire up a good show on netflix and just sit there with my dog and be happy.
How many of you prefer not to be friends with women?	I love having female friends. There's a light that turns on inside of me whenever I interact with attractive girls, I just sort of become more animated and charming. I like to be that way, so the more time I spend around women, the better. Plus, having more female friends dramatically increases your chances of getting laid because most girls have multiple lady friends :)	I was struggling to figure out how to say it, but the only way I can say it is I am friends with my friends. I have several women friends and several men friends. My dynamic is often different with my men friends, but that doesn't mean I value my women friends any less.
Mothers, what did you do to maintain your sanity in the first few weeks or months after having a baby?	Realize that you can take the baby with you almost anywhere. Most people have had kids and won't be bothered if the baby cries. And if they are bothered, f*ck 'em. When I started getting out of the house, even to do silly things like get the car detailed or go to the library, I felt so much better. Having a little baby doesn't mean you're trapped in the house.	I cried the first three weeks after my first child was born, but only if I was alone with him. So I spoke to a co-worker once a day and she let me cry or talk or she'd share parenting advice. I also made a habit and got into a routine. So Ellen came on, and would start dancing. So if dance with my little one in my arms. After those three weeks, hormones started to even out :)
When you're checking a girl out, what exactly are you looking at?	>when a man is looking at them they're noticing all their flaws. How accurate is this? Not at all. That is what women do when they look at other women, and believe it or not, men and women think differently.	> I think it's common for lots of women to assume that when a man is looking at them they're noticing all their flaws. How accurate is this? Not at all accurate. The only time I have judgemental thoughts about people is when they're acting rude or inconsiderate or whatever. If a girl were to notice me looking at her, it's probably because I'm checking her out, and I definitely haven't noticed whatever insignificant detail she's stressing about.
Did anyone else send nude pictures to creepers online as adolescents?	Oh god never. I didn't think of myself as a particularly sexual being until I was like 20 (even though guys would try to hook up with me and I had boyfriends and stuff). Rando dudes would ask and I was always like "lol why"	I think it's best I came of age in the 56k days. You want to see a picture? you better have 5 minutes to wait for it to download.
What's the best way to politely ask our neighbor to stop letting his dog shit in our yard?	There is no reason to be polite in this case. Just tell him to look after his dog. Be straight forward. Thats it.	I've had to do this. I just went to their door and said politely, "Hey, I'm not sure if you are aware, but your dog has been pooping in our yard. I was wondering if you could please keep him on your property?" It went well. They said they had no idea and it seemed genuine-ish. Anyway I'm mostly commenting to say that my city has a pet bylaw about this that basically states that if you allow your dog to defecate on someone else's property it MUST be cleaned up right away. There's a hefty fine attached to it if it goes that far. I would imagine that other city's have something similar so if the problem keeps persisting after trying to deal with it directly, you may have options.
Have you ever issued an 'ultimatum' to your partner, that if it wasn't met you'd break up? What was the ultimatum and did they follow through?	Usually if you are open and communicate your issues, an ultimatum shouldn't be necessary. If they are openly going against something you feel very strongly about, an ultimatum wouldn't help anyhow. If you do draw a line, be sure you are willing to follow through when it is crossed. Good luck	Booze or me. He chose me and hasn't had a drink since. That was *years* ago. I will say that I had already begun to make plans to leave if he chose the booze, so it wasn't an empty threat. We just celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary and are very close. I'm grateful he chose me, it would have been sad to miss out on my relationship with this wonderful man.
As I've gotten older, I found myself turned off by full on pussy shots that 21 year old me would've loved. What has changed for you since you've gotten older that you used to like and now can't stomach it?	Music. Not that I cant stomach it, I just honestly dont give a shit. I have music I used to listen to that I like, but when I have free time I usually engage in intellectual pursuits like reading something or listening to some podcast on an interesting subject. Anymore I only listen to music when I run or when I'm at a bar.	Things young men often like, but I don't any more: cheap booze, validation from my friends, packaged junk food, sweet soda pop (I can still take dryer sodas, like ginger ale). Things that I still haven't outgrown at 46 and probably won't ever: fatty and salty foods, video games, fascination with boobs.
Women living below the poverty line, what does your day to day look like?	........like a normal day? wake up, eat, work, come home, do chores, make dinner, shower, sleep. wake up and repeat. how do i stay inspired? by remembering that i am still young. and right now, things will be rough. just like it is for most young people. like it was for my parents. before they became successful	Most days I just go to work (take buses each way), eat and watch TV at home, then go to bed after a couple of hours. Nobody at this place actually likes it, but I'm glad I was able to find something when I've gotten rejected by every other place I had to interview for, and hopefully I can get something better once I have more experience.
What TV show or movie that Reddit loves can you not get into?	Seinfeld. The Simpsons. Not to pick on them specifically - I've never really found sitcoms all that compelling - but they both seem to be Reddit darlings.	How I Met Your Mother It's like the lowest brow comedy and I hate all the characters. Don't understand the obsession.
Mother's Day in Canada. Anyone find this day depressing/have a difficult or bad relationship with their mother?	So, in case anyone needs a little extra support dealing with awful parents or you'd just like to know you're not alone, /r/raisedbynarcissists is a really great place to go. The mods are good about shutting down intrusions from any difficult people you may be trying to avoid and everyone is really friendly. You'll be surprised how many other people share your experiences. Mother's day is pretty difficult for a lot of us. I just sat through a two hour dinner (that I paid for!) of near constant complaints from my mother and knowing that I'm not alone made it survivable.	Today, at the restaurant I work at, an elderly couple waited a few hours for their daughter to show up for their mothers day brunch and she never came. It's definitely a hard day for a lot of people.
Those of you who are divorced, when did you know that the marriage was over?	It's quite long winded and I can't be bothered to cover all the drama, so long story short, we fought over a jar of peanut butter, I threw a shoe at his legs but apparently it caught his kidney and really hurt, next thing I know he had me pinned to the bed and spat in my face. Repeatedly. I had to headbutt him violently to get him off me as he was a lot stronger. Haha, that's the first time I've realised my marriage essentially ended over a jar of peanut butter. Yes I still eat it, now I'll eat it with glee remembering that.	I've told this story a few times. In short, it was the mother of all drunken outbursts, ending with him coming at me with a knife. After a murder attempt, however halfhearted, I don't do take backsies. I let him get across the country before I let him know I wasn't coming. I can reflect on it now and just see how ridiculous things are, but it was terrifying then. As soon as any abuse starts, get out. I waited too long and I almost lost my life, I know others aren't as fortunate.
So, I'm sterile. When should I mention this?	Tell her when she says "I'm Pregnant". Also double check every year because there are some cases where balls start working again. I know a couple who were both told neither of them could reproduce and they have 2 kids now.	I wouldn't mention it on a first date but with in the early stages of dating before you get to the commitment might be the best time to mention it. How old are you if you don't mind me asking?
Women with a fear of driving, how did you get over it and become a confident driver?	Tbh I still have some driving driving, but just doing it more makes you less nervous. I got my license on my 16th birthday, but I didn't do any real driving like getting on the interstate until I was 19. Most of the time, things aren't as bad as your brain is making it seem. This week, I drove two hours to help my friend move into her apartment at her college, and I thought the drive would be awful, but for the most part, it was uneventful.	Practice. The only thing that makes you a confident driver is having to do it. I started out on quiet backstreets with not much traffic. Then on busier roads. Unfortunately, it is only way you get confidence with a skill is through practising it and getting experienced. Don't drive with other people in the car if that freaks you out. Or only drive with people who don't distract you /make you feel stressed.
What is the most fucked up thing you witnessed lately?	A friend of mine is so desperate to be with someone, that she's okay with alcoholics who have tempers, choke her, beat her, deny her from leaving the house. It makes me ill whenever I hear about a new abuse. Yet she doesn't fix things. Or tighten up her criteria a bit. Like no alcohol, for example. Almost all of this happens when the guy is drunk. I don't get it. The pattern is there. She has kids to think about. If she gets really hurt by one of these guys, or even worse, killed? What the fuck is gonna happen to them then?	Was walking my dog through the park and saw that there were about fifteen police officers there. Out of curiosity I walked by a saw a body bag on the floor and was told by an officer that an 18 year old kid had hung himself from a tree.
What do you think about women slapping men in films and TV shows?	It's gross and not OK and needs to stop. Hitting is not OK, period, and it's hypocritical to say or do otherwise. Don't play into a gross MRA stereotype.	I think women on TV hit men (or other women) for things that are waaaaaay less acceptable than reasons to hit anybody in real life. Like in real life unless it's self defense almost everyone I know would view any form of violence as unacceptable. On TV let's say a male character tells a female character she's fat and she slaps him, the vibe you get from the show is he somehow deserved it. Obviously, he said a mean thing. But hitting him over it is an overreaction -- unless you're on TV and then it's just good drama.
What motivates you to go to the gym ?	Motivates me? You're doing it wrong. It's part of my routine. I made my decision to do it, planned how I was going to do it, and then stuck to my plan. Told myself I'd re-evaluate the plan after 6 months.	I want a nice body. I like being able to see the progress. I want to be bigger than I am right now.
How do I get women to view me sexually?	You avoid the friend zone by never becoming friends with women. I never become friends with a woman until after I've slept with her. Just be honest about your intentions, if you pretend to be her friend, she'll want to be your friend and won't be attracted to you. It's perfectly fine to be friendly, while also expressing a sexual desire, as long as it isn't aggressive. Let them know from the outset that you have enough friends, you aren't interested in being friends, but you are interested in them though. Start of sexual, get to know them after, if it doesn't seem like a good fit that's when you become friends	There's already a lot of 'Lift weights' in this thread. While it certainly helps, you don't have to be muscular to get laid. Being a muscular dude won't magically get you out of the friendzone, because you still won't know how to behave around women in a way that makes them see you as a sexual being. - Be confident. - Be friendly. - Be funny. - **Be flirty.** - Don't put them on a pedestal. - **Be aggressive.** No, don't go around molesting girls. But make moves and make it clear you are not looking for a friend. - Don't be a doormat. €dit: Bolded the important parts.
What is the best thing you have ever done for your career?	Joined the military. I am not in the military now, but my is heavily dependent on my previous knowledge and experience.	Applied for a job I was sure I didn't have enough experience or knowledge to get. It was a long shot but I did it anyway. Got a dream job and set myself up way better than I would have if I'd only stuck to the things I thought I qualified for.
Women who were ugly/average until college and then blossomed into beautiful/hot, what was the hardest thing to deal with after the transition?	Being so used to rejection and ridicule that you don't even try, or underestimate your "league". Thinking you don't "deserve" a decent looking, self-confident, and professionally happy guy because you're "not in his league" is a recipe for rough relationships, or none at all.	Figure out who likes me for who I am. It gets extra difficult when the guy himself misreads his own feelings and mistakes physical attraction (+ friendly interest) with romantic interest. Extra heartbreaking when he realizes it was mostly lust after I already fell in love.
What are your thoughts on being in a relationship where you are the breadwinner and your career is the one that is the primary focus?	Fine but I would be concerned if he were earning so little that I was paying more than my share of the bills etc.	I like things to be a little more balanced, but if it came to it, I'd prefer being the breadwinner. I like to feel in control of my life
As a uber driver who drives late at night, when I drop off female passengers, do I wait for them to enter their home/apt building safely, or is that creepy and I should drive off immediately?	I personally prefer when they drive off immediately, because when people sit there my main thoughts are "They're staring at my ass while I walk away," "They are trying to see which apartment I walk into," or just "Huh, that's creepy. Hope I don't get murdered in my sleep," ha. But I have anxiety that probably contributes to those thoughts, so it might be different for people without anxiety.	I'd be very pleased if a driver asked me what I prefer, and would most likely say yes unless I got some weird vibes. I've been locked out of my house with a dead phone at 3AM before! Without warning it may seem creepy.
1 line of dating advice for your son, 1 line for your daughter, 1 line for both. What are they?	Son. She wants your wallet and your sperm, she doesn't love you. Daughter. All he is looking for is something he can tolerate and put his dick in. Both. What you call "love" is just nature compelling you to breed, it hits hard and slowly fades.	Son: Wrap it before you tap it. Daughter: If he doesn't respect you before sex he won't respect you after. Both: You deserve someone who makes you happy and should never settle for less.
Has anyone here been in an emotional affair and willing to share their story? How did you heal the relationship with your partner? How did you manage having strong feelings for someone other than your partner?	Well I was an emotional cheater, but I made the choice to leave my boyfriend at the time. We had been together for a few months, but not connecting. I chose to end the relationship and pursue a new relationship with the guy I had emotionally cheated with. He’s in the other room. Nearly 14 years later and we’re married.	I never had an emotional affair but I had met people that I was insanely attracted to on deeper level while being in a relationship. I acknowledged to myself that yeah I was attracted to that person but there're billions of people in this world. You'll bump into others who tickle your fancy more than your SO. I just don't do anything about it and probably stay aloof from those people not to get myself into any situation that will hurt my partner.
What is the weirdest presumption about female sexuality you have ever heard?	Dude here: Sex education is terrible for all genders, but I feel like it's worse for guys. Those gynecological maps in health class like sophomore year do a terrible job of indicating where everything is actually located on a woman, especially the fun parts.	There's this porn idea that women are obsessed with jizz, like when I sleep with a dude I just can't wait to milk him like a goddamn cow. Then I want to smear it all over my face and walk around like jizz Carrie. And at some point I want to save whatever I haven't eaten like it's my last meal in some kind of jizz beaker that I bought special for when I steal jizz, so I can make a lot of sexy stolen babies, because the only thing women love more than jizz is raising children as a single parent.
Men of AskMen who grew up before the Internet became huge: How did YOU get your porn fix?	I came of age right before the Internet was literally everywhere. Had a friend with an older brother who had porno mags and tapes, and we would raid his stash. Also, in the beginning, it was actually kind of tough to find good, free porn (don't get me wrong, you could see tons of boobs everywhere but actually getting a good clip or galleries or VIDEOS was somewhat difficult). There were sites that compiled passwords for big paysites. Nothing like pornhub.	I grew up during the rise of the internet, I've seen both sides of the porn-revolution haha. When I was younger, all I could access was a Victoria's Secret magazine, or more commonly, the underwear section of the Sears Catalog.
What has changed since you went from "girlfriend" to "wife"?	Absolutely nothing. We got married in January for insurance purposes, had been together for nearly nine years, and had lived together for about six. Everything is the same, except that our relationship is just like everyone else's now. I always kind of preferred not being married. I felt like it was special to have such a strong relationship that the government didn't have their fingers in.	Other people seem to take our relationship more seriously and have more respect for it, whether it be friends/family or random people who may hit on either one of us. I've never met a guy who cared when I've told him I have a boyfriend but they tend to back off when I tell them I'm married. Plus, I know it's stupid, but I feel a little more special and confident in our relationship. I like being introduced as his wife rather than his girlfriend...oh and I also like being covered on his health insurance lol
Psychologists theorize that women, not men, are largely the ones who suppress each others’ sexualities. Do you agree with this statement?	Yeah, I don't think so. It's men who keep rejecting women for being "whores" and value how many partners they have. Sure, some women love to judge and police other women but slut shaming is undeniably a male invention that was created to scare or shame women into maintaining their "sexual purity", whatever that means. Just because *some* men don't slut shame doesn't mean that all men don't and that women are magically responsible for this behavior. Also, I think it's important to recognize that slut shaming takes on many forms, some more nuanced than others. Asserting that you "would never let your wife/daughter/girlfriend" dress like any provocatively dressed person, judging someone's choice of birth control, etc are all forms of slut shaming that many men take part in but don't realize because it's not outright calling anyone a slut.	Considering that literally the only people I've ever met who ever tried to suppress or shame sexuality were women, this seems to be true in my experience.
Those of us in not-America, what are the issues facing your part of the world?	Issues, you say? Well, there's the issue of people dividing the world into America and not-America. That's quite a big one. I'm British. The biggest issue here right now is that the Tory government is persecuting the poorest and most vulnerable members of society.	We just called an election in Canada. I'm not thrilled with any of the candidates and it makes me sad. We're also so goddamn apathetic we won't have a great voter turnout anyway (we never do). Also there are fliers circulating equating the Liberal leader Justin Trudeau with abortion because he is pro-choice. The fliers show his face and a super graphic dead fetus, and they're turning up on people's doorsteps to disturb everyone. Some mail carriers are trying to refuse to deliver them, but that brings up all kinds of free speech issues. I don't like Justin Trudeau at all (although I agree with him on abortion) but this is beyond inappropriate.
What things have you been asked for from a partner/FWB that were hard no's? How did they react?	The very concept of FWB is a hard no for me. Waste my time because I'm not *quite* hot enough for you to be with only me and you want to see if someone better comes along? GTFO with that noise, I'd rather just be single in that case than risking my safety, dignity and self esteem to be someone's walking fleshlight. I've been told FWB doesn't really mean that (so maybe I'm off base here), and maybe it's because I've been in a relationship for a long time, but to me, it's stringing someone along and it's basically telling someone "You're hot enough for me to get hard to, but not hot enough for me to actually want to date, so I'm going to waste away your fertile years while I try and find my Giselle." No freaking way.	Wanted me to sell my eggs, solely for our financial gain. He didn't have a job, was in college paid for by his rich dad. His dad was smart enough to have him on a comfortable but meager allowance for essentials. I worked parttime as a grocery store cashier, still in high school. We were pretty young (me 18, him nearly 21), but I was still deeply offended that he'd ask this of me before even trying to get a job. He was disappointed. Tried to coax me into it for a while. Needless to say.. we're not together anymore. I upgraded my self esteem and standards for s.o's accordingly.
Broken after a breakup: what are your self-care tips?	put on your favorite outfit and leave your house. get your best girlfriend, your best gay friend, or mom/aunt whatever and do something fun out in the world. take notice of how the world reacts to you as an individual (not just how men react to you physically but people as a whole)--this will help boost your confidence and remember your number one priority: you!	Allow yourself some time to feel all of it. Importantly, be kind to yourself - if you want to cry, cry. There were many days I snuck into the bathroom at work to let the tears flow. But keep pulling yourself back up and together! For me, the gym provided great outlet for all of these overwhelming emotions. I ran and lifted a lot. I rediscovered yoga and meditation that gave me positive vibes. I also Netflix binged on all sorts of mindless shows - Gilmore Girls, Drop Dead Diva, Love, etc. I learned to cook all kind of different dishes. I went to cooking classes with my sister. I made more effort to see my friends who were incredibly supportive. A quote that I found really helpful: "Life is constantly moving, and the best thing to do is to move forward with it." Hugs.
Guys who work in offices, how do you deal with it?	I don't participate in politics. I act like a little bitch boy and always agree with the most powerful people. It's worked out well so far	* Get up at the last possible minute * Sit in traffic * Stumble in 5 to 10 minutes late * Get coffee * Check email, backup server status, Reddit, and Fantasy Football team * Get more coffee, maybe stop and talk to someone * Go back to office and put feet up (not joking) * Think about what I need to do that day. If nothing then Reddit * If something then do it then Reddit * Check my stocks * Hammer out as much of any given project I'm working on until my brain stops working for the day or I accomplish that days goals or come to a good stopping point. * Fuck around * Gym
How did you meet the girl you're dating and how did it start off?	I was born with her and I loved her ever since. It's the most loyal right hand you'll ever see.	We both worked at the same movie theater, but at different times. I had a party, and one of my friends brought her with. She started coming over all the time (we had a lot of parties). She was just a great friend. I started offering my bed for her to sleep in so she wouldn't drive home drunk, completely platonic. That went on for about a month, and then it gradually turned into a relationship. That was 9 years ago, we've been married for 6 1/2. We're getting divorced, but we have 2 awesome kids to show for it. Edit: Thanks for all of the kind things everyone has said. Didn't think this comment would get much attention at all, but the positive re-enforcement has been helpful. This community can be really great some times.
What is something that someone close to you is in denial about?	My roommate is in complete denial about everything. From how much she sucks at life, how bad of a friend she is, to how her failed relationships with everyone around her is their fault. Also how toxic she is being in her relationship, and how lazy her boyfriend is. It's hard to be around, so I just avoid her	One of my old friends is an alcoholic. We've tried to talk to her about it many times, and so has her family, and she just doesn't get it. Same woman is also confused as to how she's "mysteriously" gained so much weight in the past 8 years when her twin sister hasn't and they eat the same stuff. It doesn't take long around them to see that she eats twice as much as her sister on top of drinking about 10x as much. We've tried to explain to her - gently - about calories in alcohol and such but she just refuses to acknowledge the problem.
How old were you when you first felt sexualised? How did that make you feel and how did you deal with it?	I'm 17 and I honestly think I've never been sexualized except when it was mutual and just like teenagers flirting. So um idk?	When I was 11 I was over at my friends house for the night. She took me into her room and said her dad "thought I was sexy and wanted to hook up" He then came in and said he'd love to touch me if I'd let him and that I really turned him on. I was mortified and told him no and reminded him that my dad was a cop.
Men that made an honest mistake at work that resulted in a co-workers injury or loss of equipment that costs several thousand dollars how did you cope with it?	I fucked up on a simple oil change and we ended up having to use our insurance to buy a new engine. It totally wrecked me. After that I lost all confidence and could barely do my jobs for months. When it got really slow in the winter they let me go, since I was useless anyway. I moved to a different mechanic job but I was so scared of making another mistake my boss fired me 6 months in because I was going to slow and wasn’t making him enough money. He also hated running the shop and sold it shortly after firing me. I haven’t worked as a mechanic since.	I work in stock trading. Mishandled a trade which cost about $36k. Kind of a perfect storm of events... basically just admit your mistake and learn from it. Things happen.
How important is your partner's intelligence/maturity?	Education level or specific type of intelligence doesn't matter much to me, but an absolute requirement for me is a lively curious mind. I'm a couple standard deviations to the right of the mean, and it's extremely important to me that my partner be fairly intelligent. Realistically, I think there would be a fundamental incompatibility in a relationship with a person of below-average intelligence. For maturity, it's important for me to be with someone who is comfortable in their own skin and able to communicate and take responsibility for their actions. This isn't always a function of age, unfortunately.	Maturity is important to me, but it depends on how you define maturity. Some women seem to think doing anything that a child might do is immature, but I just call that fun. I want a woman who can be mature about the important stuff, like using proper communication instead of mind games, but can still have fun playing video games or just generally goofing off.
Non-smoking men in relationships, how much do you care if your s/o smokes or not? Single men, if you find out an attractive girl smokes, how much does it change your opinion of her?	the amount of people for whom smoking would be a dealbreaker here is fucking weird to me. i don't smoke (maybe a cigarette or two when drunk), but there are so many factors about a person that would completely trump smoking for me. in the right people's hands, smoking can be downright sexy. yeah, the taste and the smell of a habitual smoker aren't all that great, but if i found them otherwise attractive, i wouldn't notice it at all.	It's an absolute dealbreaker. I'd be devastated if my wife took it up. My mom and dad died 6 days apart because of that shit a few years ago, and (all other reasons aside, of which there are many) I don't want to go through that again with my wife.
Formerly clingy ladies, what made you realize you were clingy or needy, and how did you deal with it?	I'm clingy and needy. I tell my boyfriend to tell me if I am being clingy and needy. He accepts that I'm clingy and needy and I shouldn't have to be something I'm not. I probably couldn't be with someone that doesn't accept that. I like feeling close with my partner. He tells me if he needs alone time and it's all good.	I'm still clingy. I try not to be clingy to the point where I blow up his phone if I feel like he doesn't respond quickly enough; but I get all stressy about it and I get all sad when I feel he's being distant, I try to combat this by trying to not show any outward signs of being clingy and needy, which is fucking difficult. Honestly though, I think this also ties in with my anxiety; so I'm trying to work on my anxiety, so hopefully this will eventually ease up.
What's the loneliest thing you've ever done?	I bought about $70 worth of sushi a couple of days ago. When I went to pick it up they put three pairs of chopsticks in the bag. I must have looked confused cause they asked if that was enough. I got embarrassed and said I needed one more pair. It was all for me except like two rolls for my boyfriend when ever he got home.	i once drove around town for 2-3 hours on my birthday so i could come back and lie to my parents that i'd hung out with friends. i didn't want them feeling bad for me if i'd spent my entire birthday alone in my room - which i wouldn't have been bothered by at all if i did do that, i just didn't want them to be sad or anything.
What food item(s) do you consider to be vastly overrated to the point of almost making you angry like who the fuck thought this would taste good and why do people keep eating it?	Those Starbucks coffee milkshakes. Granted, I've never actually had one, but everything about them repulses me and I can't understand why they're so popular. Just the thought of drinking one makes my teeth feel rotten.	I hate ranch. It doesn't bother me that other people like it, but it does bother me when people seem convinced that if I just tried it ONE MORE TIME, I would like it. Also, my boyfriend loves kombucha and I swear he's made me try like 6 or 7 different brands. I JUST DON'T LIKE IT, BABE.
How soon did you move in with your S/O?	6 months in, and he proposed a week later. It’s only been a month and a half, but so far everything’s going great!	Just now and it's been good so far! We've been dating 8 years Granted, we met when we were 19 and 20, so we needed time to grow up a bit, and then time to get financially stable.
Ladies who are gamers: what's your favorite game and why?	I don't like the term "gamer" as an identifier for myself, but I play a lot of games. My favorite is Thomas Was Alone, probably. It's clever and tricky and simple yet infuriating.	I get so much crap for it, but legit Harvest Moon is my favorite game - or I guess up until A New Beginning & now it's Story of Seasons. People are like *it's just a farming game* but I like making money, taking care of cute animals, mining, fishing, establishing relationships. I think it's the nostalgia of it too, since I loved it as a kid.
When did you realize your friend group kinda sucked?	When almost all of them left my birthday party early. I later found out that they went to get pizza and see a movie and had planned it while still at my house.	When I asked them to hang out and they all either ignored the question or said no. After this happened ten times in a row over a period of several months, I just gave up.
When I'm around my gay friends, I tend to "act a bit gay". Does anybody else do this? Gay men, does this happen/offend you?	Are you sure you just aren't a bit gay and that's why you act a bit gay? I think it's normal to pick up some of the attitudes of the people you hang out with, if they are gregarious or whatever, but changing your attitudes about being sexually open and acting more flamboyant is a little extreme.	I can't speak from experience for this specific example, but I do know that "mirroring" people you know pretty well when you are around them (picking up their mannerisms and sayings) is pretty common.
Dear men, what’s the difference between the non-verbal downwards head nod and the upwards one?	I nod quickly down and back up to signal everythings okay, like when turning water on to a new sink, it means no leaks, its good. If i nod up it means fuck waters going everywhere and its usually occomoanied by a random short vocalization of frustration	Upwards: What's up man? How you doing? Acknowledgement of our knowing each other. Invitation to start talking. Downward: Acknowledgment of respect, agreement, understanding and/or wariness of each other or the situation at hand. EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards, I appreciate them greatly. And I'm glad we apparently have a near-universal form of communication.
What is the coolest "guy stuff" that I can buy on Amazon for $30?	Does Amazon sell gay porn? I think they have sex toys. You could probably get a butt plug. Or maybe some cutoffs and a leather vest--that's probably more than $30, though.	Furniture straps for moving. You'll be the adult Boy Scout among those who help you move. Knife sharpening kit because sharp kitchen knives are the best kitchen tool ever. Light weight camping flashlight or lantern. A tarp Eneloope rechargeable batteries
How do you forgive yourself for the bad and hurtful things you've done when you were in your early 20s and younger?	My therapist helped me see from a perspective of a witness. By understanding the reasons I did whatever hurts and wrongs to others was because they’re something I had learned from my direct environment. Anyone in my position would do the same, because the only training I got was that, and that was the best I could do, at that moment. No matter how much I wanted to change what had happened, I cannot. But I can learn from it, accept it, and change what I will do in the future—this is where my therapist came to help, her role is to give me a positive reference point, a way out of my past choices to how I actually wanted to act, to think, to believe in my own skin—and I am grateful for having taken the step towards realising it in my current life.	If you keep beating up your past self, how do you expect your present self to ever be healed? As long as you’ve grieved and learned from your mistakes, it’s in your best interest to forgive yourself and move on. Imagine what you would say to your best friend if they shared how much they’re struggling with old mistakes, and share that healing love with yourself. Everyone goes through this at some point, it’s part of being human.
Girlfriend called in sick to work - they want a Doctors note. What pissed you off today?	It's a restaurant job, what did you expect? Those managers have to deal with so much bullshit from staff that this is usually the norm, particularly in corporate run establishments.	IMO employers that require doctor's notes should be required to pay for 100% of the visit. No reimbursements - bills sent directly to employer.
Women of ask reddit, what are you STILL salty about?	Theology prof said at the start of the semester that he doesn't care if we're not religious as long as we're true to ourselves. Got a poor grade and almost repeated the year.	When we told my FIL we were having a girl, the first words out of his mouth were, "Well you can try again." That was over 10 years ago, and it instantly came to mind when I read this question.
Men who are at work right now, what do you have to do today?	Radiator in a Chevy, throttle body on a tundra, two wheel hubs on a Monte Carlo, a master cylinder on an old Mercedes, a brake booster in a jeep and install a grill guard for the sheriffs. It's been a busy day	I have a bunch of invoices to approve, rebar and concrete to order, a schedule to make, lots of redditing, and probably some other important stuff that I will end up pushing back to next week because I'm lazy.
What's the worst sex advice you've ever received from a woman's magazine?	Look up into his eyes while going down on him. I tried it once and my husband now calls that look "the crazy eyes"	I remember reading once, in Cosmo or Glamour or something, that most men enjoy a bit of rough play when it comes to their balls, and so when giving a blowjob, biting on them might heighten his pleasure. Now, I fully understand that there are men who enjoy the kinkier side of things when it comes to their testicles, but had I ever followed that advice, I think any of the men I've ever been with would have had a fit and cowered in pain in the corner.
Women in long term relationships, do you have days when you feel super in love with your partner?	I don't know if you call 3 years long ( we're living together for 2 years now), but I definitely know that. Some days I'm worried because we arent that 'sticky-loveing' couple anymore, but then we go out and people ask us how long we''ve been together '3 years' 'wow- I did not expected that, you guys look SO in love', so that's awesome.	Definitely. I mean, I'm always in love with him, but some days I want to physically cling to him, give him a billion kisses all over, cook for him, give him everything he wants, and sex him simply because I love him and express it to him by making him as satisfied/happy as possible.
Have you ever said yes to a woman making the first move?	As with most threads on the internet, this one has strong selection bias - you're going to get the minority of the male population who would say yes to a woman approaching and men who are more liberal/submissive.	I've been asked out three times in my life. I said yes twice and no once. I think what we're seeing on /r/askwomen is that women ask someone out, get turned down once and figure that the whole venture is a waste of time. Newsflash: that's *exactly* how it works for guys asking girls out. We get rejected a lot. Men have had to deal with it for years and women are just recently starting to understand it.
How have you handled a date where you got cat-fished?	Lol at the unnecessary hyphenation in "cat-fished." It is not like anyone is out there fishing for cats. The term refers to the actual fish: catfish	I went out with a girl who invited me to a bar. She was literally not even the same person as her photos. She was buzzing already when I showed up. 9/11 Consipiracy theorist. Looking to take shots at 4pm. I used a fake-call app to step away from the table. I literally just walked out and didn't come back and ignored the calls and texts. Fuck that shit. I was there a grand total of 8 or 9 minutes.
What is something you'd like to say to a friend/ coworker/ relative/ partner, but can't for whatever reason? What is the reason you cannot?	Forget your boyfriend, he doesn't love you like I do and come back home because you're the only one that puts up with me and I miss you. I can't say that because she's my best friend and she's happy where she is. I don't exactly want to spoil things for her.	Honestly, sometimes I just want to gush to my friends about how much I love them and think they're amazing people who deserve all the best in life and I want them to be so happy. But I get self-conscious and I think that could easily be awkward for everyone so I keep it to myself.
How do you compliment girls when you have a girlfriend?	If you’re girlfriend is so controlling / insecure that you can’t compliment another woman, I’d be concerned. You can’t go through this life and pretend other women don’t exist.	If its something you would compliment your mom or grandma on then do that, and word it exactly like you would if you were talking to them. Make sure people see you complimenting others and not women more than men and definitely not specific women over others. I guess you could tell your gf what you are trying to do, as something interesting to share and like a heads up not in a "is it okay if i.." permission seeking way. Good on you for trying to spread the happy feels.
What 5 food things bring you the most joy?	1. A fresh triple steakburger with cheese, ketchup, and mayo from Steak and Shake. 2. Homemade fries. 3. Mashed potatoes with garlic. 4. Orange soda floats. 5. Pepperoni and grilled chicken pizza from Pizza Hut.	1. There way a pizza crust is charred when it was cooked in a wood fired oven 2. The gooey center of a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven 3. Fresh, in-season peaches 4. How satisfying it is to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate with a chefs knife 5. Eating something you spent the whole day making from scratch.
How do you convince someone they're attractive when they have zero self esteem?	Seeing that confidence is the most attractive trait in a guy...he's not attractive if he has zero self-esteem. You can convince him that he's attractive *to you* though.	Most likely they have zero self-esteem is because of their past experiences that reinforce the idea that they're ugly. The best way to counter this is to create new experiences with them that reinforce the idea that they're attractive. The more powerful the experience, the better. That's why actions are generally more powerful than words. When I was little my mom once told me that she wished that she married a white guy instead of my Asian dad and said that I was a disappointment because I reminded her of her Asian heritage. I repeat what she said to myself every night before bed. So yeah like I said, the more powerful the experience, the better.
Women of Reddit, what are the most ridiculous period questions you've ever come across?	"Why can't girls just pee out the blood?" I couldn't even come up with an answer, it was just so ridiculous.	"Do you have an orgasm when you use a tampon because it's like sex?" It's shown up on badwomensanatomy a few times.
Have you ever encountered a micro penis? What was your experience?	I had sex with a guy in college with a *super small* penis. A regular sized condom was baggy on him.	Yeah and it would have been okay if he hadn't announced, mid sex, that "my mum always said it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean". He quoted his mum. In bed. JUST NO
What is the worst case of selfish wedding bride "It's MY day" you've ever witnessed?	Technically it is her day. Every wedding my wife and I have gone to or participated in we did as asked.	It was a stinking hot, humid day, and nobody wanted to be outside for the outdoor wedding. We were doing wedding party photos and everyone was dripping in sweat and about to pass out, so we decided to finish the rest of the pics in a nice shady spot. The bride threw an actual, honest-to-god tantrum because she wanted to make the party hike all the way across the venue grounds to get shots in front of a full-sun pond. None of her bridesmaids wanted to do the ten minute walk in their heels and it would have been a terrible spot for photos, which we mentioned. She pouted her way through the rest and they divorced a year later.
My girlfriend gets tons of facebook messages from guys asking her to do porn or give them sexual favors. Is this normal?	Bruh you need to do some digging in your S/Os history. having your girl get messages like that implies that she's putting something out there in the world that makes the guys think that she would actually accept the offer.	I have my privacy settings on facebook set to only accept messages from people who are on my friends list, and I choose who I "friend" carefully on purpose. If your girlfriend has an exorbitant amount of facebook friends and accepts anyone who send her a request, she's probably going to end up with those kinds of messages. Yeah, they happen, and they're gross, and you don't even have to look like a pornstar. Internet targeting of women is real, and it's everywhere, which is why we need to put up defenses to block those messages before they get sent.
What's the toughest hurdle you've had to get past in your marriage?	Trying to deal with my husband's huge penis. I mean, that thing is enormous, and satisfies me like nothing else. But jeez, enough is enough, sometimes! Some days, I'd be okay with having less than a dozen orgasms in a row. Edit: Oops, meant to post this from my wife's account.	My SO's mom. She was cool the entire time we dated but around the time of our wedding she freaked out and got really awful, particularly toward me. He practically worshipped the ground she walked on, though, and most of the time it was like 'I agree with you but I've done all I can.' Eventually though she pushed him too far in a really transparent way, trying to get manipulative, and that changed his attitude entirely. She moved 1500 miles away and he stopped giving a shit what she thought about us as a couple.
Men who simply don't enjoy watching wildlife documentaries, why? Ever feel like you're missing out?	No but sometimes I think there's something wrong with me when my interests differ wildly from what other people my age / gender / race are into	I'm one of those guys. I see wildlife documentaries as a bunch of animals who I don't know living a life that doesn't affect me. I really have no reason to get emotionally invested. I imagine you'd get the same feeling about watching something like a South Korean muskrat ping pong tournament.
Have you ever seen any of your female friends naked / semi naked? What's the story and there was any awkwardness?	I had sex with several of my female friends from college. Just drunken one night stands. It was surprisingly not at all awkward with the women. It was my guy friends who always had the problem (they had a crush or whatever and got mad at me because I knew about it).	I have seen my best friend naked. I even bathed her. She has no family so when she had a few medical issues I kind of stepped up for her. It was not really as awkward as I thought it would be cause she is a fairly hard core lesbian so I think my brain just sort of did not recognise her as a possible sexual being?? I don't know, to me she is just one of my boys??
What is your most memorable "This bitch is crazy" moment?	When she made a soap opera out of me not talking about our issue through texting. She had a mental breakdown over two days of not texting while I was figuring things out. Plus she's incessantly childish and demands attention 24/7 when I'm in her presence. When I look away for too long she moves my hand. No joke. Why are all women crazy?	I made some flippant remark she didn't like. She gestured like she was going to stab me in the hand with a pen. I said she wouldn't. She did.
Women who kept their maiden name, what are some of the negative comments you had received?	I have two last names. As in no hyphen. It was weird for people at first not knowing what to call me. But I answer to either and both. Think Smith Jones instead of Smith-Jones. So I answer to Mrs Smith, Mrs Jones and. Mrs smith Jones.	I have this coworker who can just not seem to accept that I will always keep my maiden last names. I'm from Puerto Rico and in my culture women don't usually take their husbands last name... that's actually really rare. The way it works is that babies inherent both their father and mothers last name, so every one has 2 last names (the first is their father first last name, the second is their mother's first last name). Anyways, my coworker hates that I have 2 last names and none of them are my husband's. The other day she had the audacity of saying, and I quote, "I really hate your last names and you should really consider changing them. You need to accept that you do not live in Puerto Rico anymore and need to embrace the American culture if you want to live here"... what the fuck!
What are some red flags to watch out for in daily life?	Women posting about feminism on social media. Now, I'm all for equality, but feminism is a scary animal. And women sharing pay gap bullshit on social media are the most hateful people in general when you get to know them.	When the temperature outside suddenly drops about 10-20 degrees and things start getting a bit quiet. Also, if you see animals suddenly start hiding or making a run for it en masse. You should probably find shelter.
What's one thing you think ladies way overcomplicate?	While your example is good, I think it would be more valuable to ask the question inverted. Like, "What's one thing that women don't over-complicate?"	Silence. If I stop talking, 99% chance is because I just don't have anything else to say. It's not because you said something weird/offensive.
What's the worst gift you have received from an in-law?	A Stephanie Plum novel. Great well intentioned idea as they knew I love reading but dear God was that book terrible. Also, the first year, my boyfriend told me they would send me chocolate for Christmas so I was surprised to unwrap a shower gel. All the other ones have been awesome though.	* Meal replacement bars and diet pills * Bill O'Reilly book "Culture Warrior" * Underwear from the children's department * Sweatshirt with airbrushed dolphins and the word HAWAII in a rainbow (I've never been) * Sweater three sizes too large because "I told the sales lady you had very large breasts and she recommended this."
How many of you would be open to taking birth of control if new forms for men came out?	Anything to not have to wear fucking condoms. Seriously the person who invented them is both a Saint and the devil incarnate.	Yes but not for a little while. If it's a new thing, I'd prefer to have adequate research on what it's doing to my junk.
What was that think your girlfriend said that made you realise she wasn't a keeper and that it'd eventually end?	" i slept with someone while we were dating. It wasn't official bf/gf so i didn't think it would matter."	Somewhere in the middle of a 3 year relationship she told me that she only had sex with me because she felt obligated to do so. :-\
What's the juiciest piece of gossip you know about someone in your social circle that you've been dying to get off your chest?	This gossip is about me Throwaway acount. I've been cheating on my BF with my best friend for the past 6 months or so.	Okay...one of my fellow managers (F 38) is pregnant by a former coworker (M 19). That alone is no big deal, older women have gotten pregnant by younger guys before. The JUICY part is that everyone thinks it's the managers current boyfriend's (M 29) child, but we did the math together and she knows it's not his, he was in jail at the conception date. Manager and coworker are white. Current boyfriend is black. I'm anxiously awaiting the due date.
How do you find a girl that shares similar values/belief/maturity?	You don't. It's literally something you ingrain in your partner. Now before anyone jumps down my throat, I don't mean in some tyrannical kind of way. In terms of pair bonding women will follow in the footsteps of their men in most cases. Instinctively most women tend to gravitate to men who are exude mental and physical strength. These women will adopt the man's values and beliefs as if they were there own. There is no magic unicorn in the dating scene unfortunately for men. You will need to work on the women you're with.	Your dating pool is college kids, so... yeah. I can see why you don't have much in common with them, given your experience. You need to fish in a different pond. Are there any groups for young vets like yourself? Or for any hobbies that you might have?
Ladies, what's something you've stopped telling people because you're tired of the way they respond?	I generally don't bring up that I'm pro-life. It's my personal beliefs, it's not a judgement on other people, and I don't want to fight about my faith. I get how separation of church and state works, if we don't agree on when a fetus is alive it's a pointless discussion...	I hate mentioning eating healthy and exercising. People automatically respond with "You're not fat why would you do all that?" First, I never said I was (5'1 100lbs) second, I just want to be a healthier person! I have zero muscle in my body and get tired from physical activity very easily so I just want to better myself.
What's your "ask your husband's permission" story?	# Status: Locked and closed due to a large amount of rule-breaking comments. Thanks to those of you who participated within the rules.	# Status: Locked and closed due to a large amount of rule-breaking comments. Thanks to those of you who participated within the rules.
Alternatively, do you have a brother who fits the "neckbeard" or "forever alone" stereotype? How is your realtionship with him?	I love my brother dearly, but he is a bit if a neckbeard. Hi isn't misogynistic (he has 3 intelligent and reasonably successful sisters, so it would be a bit hard to be). He isn't really strong on social intelligence and tends to be very over opinionated and stubborn. He goes on tirades. I mostly just smile and listen, make small corrections here and there. Arguments do no good, so you need to be patient to correct the behavior. He has made some big strides in the past 4 years and I am very proud of him for that.	I did. It was awesome. We would chat everyday and game together and buy ridiculous amounts of junk food and have lans, and send each other funny internet links constantly. Then he lost weight, asked me to help shop for new clothes, and became ridiculously social and went travelling, met a woman who is now his wife, and moved to the US. And now I will be lucky if he initiates a conversation with me every 6 months, or responds to any of my messages. It makes me sad.
What's the most bizarre sexual request that more than one partner has asked of you?	More than one guy has asked to spank my ass during sex. Not sure about other girls, total turn off for me.	I've had more than one guy ask me if they could cum in my eye. I declined the tempting offer. Also, singing is one of my hobbies and my ex would ask me to try and sing while we had sex. The song I got closest to completing was I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly.
Do you feel like most women are better looking when dressed?	In the southern USA, yes. There are so many fatties and so much loose skin and stretch marks on former fatties, and they look much better with clothes on.	I appreciate girls who put a lot of time I to their clothes and makeup, but I'll *always* opt for waking up next to someone without makeup or clothes.
Does anyone else ever feel "responsible" if their friends aren't having fun at something they chose to do/didn't like the food at a restaurant they chose, etc?	No, not really. Not everyone is going to like the same stuff. I'd apologize, suggest we could do something else, or insist that they choose the next activity/food place/whatever.	Part of me knows I shouldn't take it so personally. The other part of me thinks they should know it is rude and not complain about an activity I chose. Worse than friends, my ex used to do this. Ugh. He complained about my indecisiveness and complained when I did choose a place. Ass hole.
What's the best way for a girl to ride you?	Honestly the position is a terrible way for men to get off. I enjoy the hell out of it though. Do whatever feels good for you without breaking my dick. I love the view or feeling her boobs slide accross me.	One thing nobody mentioned so far is make sure you position yourself on him so that he is comfortable. Some bloke's equipment may not be very flexible. Sitting on it wrong, with a forced awkward angle, while pressing down with your full body weight will end up with lot strain and pain. This is especially true if it's long. Find his natural angle and tilt your pelvis to match his. Everybody is different, so you'd have to suss it out. And if you do ride a bit more enthusiastically, make sure it won't slip out, as that could lead to [painful injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_fracture) in the worst case scenario.
Men of Reddit, if you saw someone who you found really attractive but they were in a wheelchair would you still date them? If not, why?	Heyy im deink pics or it didnnt happen I bet youe really oretty id go on a wheelchair ride with yoy to anywhe tee	Sure, as long as she was cool with the fact that there might be a bit of a learning curve as far as some dating things are concerned.
What was something about your high school that you thought was normal but now you know it was strange?	All the kinds at my school could sing very well. The entire student body would break out in song and perfectly choreographed dance throughout the day.	There was a cow field next door and the cows occasionally got loose and wandered through campus so we had a designated "cow committee" made up of teachers and administrators to deal with them.

Women of Reddit, what was/is it like being least physically attractive member of your friend group?	Not something I would ever think about. Of course my friend group is all dudes. But I've never compared myself to other people physically.	It's a bit like being punched in the gut. You know, logically, that it shouldn't hurt as much as it does, and your worth as a person doesn't revolve around people wanting to fuck you, and it isn't their fault that they get so much more attention and people like them better and everything always works out for them, but it sucks. It just sucks. I've known since I was a little girl. I don't know how much of it has to do with race (I grew up as one of the only black people in a mostly white area), but it's always been the case. I fixed it myself. Can't feel bad about being the ugliest friend if you haven't got any friends.
Is modern dating that bad? Or it is just Reddit?	Yes, it's horrible for women. We just don't have any quality options. It's better to remain single than deal with trash options, imo.	I was dating in my late 20's and had a great time! I am so so so grateful for the internet, where you can pretty much disclose your deal breakers and preferences upfront. It made things really easy and enjoyable for me, and I didn't waste anyone's time, disclosed that I wanted marriage and not just dating for years, so all the biggies were there upfront, which I'm happy about
What do you wish you'd been told before puberty?	This isn't strictly puberty related, but tell her she's beautiful frequently. She will roll her eyes and disbelieve you but she needs to hear it from someone to help built her self esteem. Compliment her on everything--how smart she is, how hard she works, how creative she is, etc.	Go to the book store and buy "the care and keeping of you." It will tell her a lot. You will need to tell her about birth control though.
What's the worst thing an ex-partner has said about having sex with you?	Guy here. I just wanted to say, you ladies shouldn't let a moron's words/insults or whatever get to you. you'll find someone much better that deserves you and anything you have to offer. sincerely, every non horrible guy	This happened while I was still seeing him: a couple of months after we lost our virginity to each other, my ex told me that I needed to lose a lot of weight because he "deserved to have sex with a woman who had a great body".
Do you have any non-standard 'rules' for your relationship?	I guess this isn't a rule for a specific relationship, but my girlfriends and I (most of us are kind of dating around, just having fun) have made a pact that none of us are allowed to date a guy whose favorite tv show is South Park, Family Guy, or another similar "adult" animation.	If either of us makes a kissy sound, we have to drop what we're doing and kiss. The other person has to come to the person who made the sound (so it's a good way to lure someone to bed...). Even if we're mad at each either, or tired, or stressed, or busy. We didn't really explicitly set this rule out but we started doing it and it's like an unspoken rule between us. It's a tool.
How to tell a close mate that bringing his girlfriend to every guy's event is starting to piss off the group just a little?	Hey, bud. I'm telling you straight as a friend should: Look around. No one else is bringing a date to these get-togethers. If you can't come solo, don't show up. It's "Guys' Night". You're pissing off the entire group.	In my experience, after the “ guys only “ conversation, you will just start seeing less and less of him. He will drift away from the group to hang with his girl. It happens in every group of guys.
Your girlfriend is attempting to seduce you, what is she doing to achieve that?	When my wife wants to have sex, we wears fewer/no clothes or tells me she's horny. Attached women don't have to be seductive. They just have to be available. Seduction is move for women trying to move in on a taken guy by being hotter/more sexually available than the lady he's taken by.	I find that pushing me down into a sitting position, sitting in my lap facing me with my hands put on her hips, and then proceeding to kiss me before kissing down my neck while she starts to take off her top and my shirt is a strong opener.
(XPost from AskWomen) Do unnattractive men feel invisible/ignored?	This question goes to show how women have no fucking clue how easy life is for them sometimes. Equality is a long way away, if you ask me.	I'm not unattractive, but I hardly get any attention, despite having been told by others that I am attractive. This doesn't bother me, I prefer solitude, but does seem to fit in the idea that even attractive men are ignored unless they are *very* attractive.
Women who chose to remain single for the majority of their lives, why was that the right decision for you?	27 male in the Midwest. Started dating older women. It really gave me a better perspective for what I wanted from a SO. 👍 best of luck!!! Being single is my favorite so smile big :)	I like me better single. There’s no anxiety about the relationship and how we’re doing, if they are happy, if I am happy, if I’m doing the right things and staying at the right level of attentiveness without being too much. It’s just me. And the cats.
Why does it seem like society is more accepting of girls with masculine hobbies than boys with feminine hobbies?	A lot of posts here suggest that it's because "masculinity is seen as superior". OK fine. But I think the sentence needs to go further, since "superior *at what*, exactly?" It is more accurate to say that masculinity is *more attractive to women*, and being attractive to women is what men really care about. A *lot*. If a woman is into axe-throwing or rock-climbing, it is unlikely to impact how attractive she is to men. It might even make her more attractive. If a man is into flower-arranging or knitting or does pilates, it is very likely to negatively impact how attractive he is to women. Hence, both women and men are more accepting of women with masculine hobbies, because girls can do anything. Both women and men are against men with feminine hobbies because *both* sexes think feminine hobbies make men less masculine and therefore less attractive.	“Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short. wear shirts and boots because it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. Because you think that being a girl is degrading.”
Women who cut off contact with their exes, how long do you wait to reconnect/reply to them, and how do you know when you're ready?	Ex and I split and agreed to a 6 mo. No Contact. I've called her a few times after that, and they were small chats. Once I asked her to watch my cat if she had time. As I was dealing with family issues. I sent her a text a few months ago and never got a replay, so I figure she has no desire to be friends post break up, so if she wants to talk to me she'll call or text in her own time. Meanwhile I've completely moved on and don't think about her at all. Shame I would like to have been friends but I guess some people really can't get past their past.	One of my best friends is an ex, and I'm very good friends with his fiancé. Although our relationship was short, and awkward, as we had been friends beforehand. It was more like a, we had discussed our "feelings" while drinking one evening, started dating and dated for a few months. We realized that we were better off friends, and terminated that. Now I'm going to be the officiant for their wedding. And the rest, good fucking riddance. My abusive ex (broke up August '14) *still* tries to contact me, and I just keep blocking each new number he calls/texts/emails from.
Yesterday was the first time in my life I've seen a man breakdown crying. I've never felt so bad for anyone prior to this. Does anyone else relate?	I've not got enough time to read what you wrote, and I apologize for that. I have noticed over the last few months that for myself weakness can be my strength. I think it takes much more strength to be weak than it does to not show weakness in our culture.	People try so incredibly hard to hide our weaknesses from others, I think guys especially are incredibly discouraged from showing vulnerability. It was probably so tough for him to open up like that. Whenever I see another person do something like that, I always just feel in my head like, "OMG I go through those feelings too, you have no idea how much." It's almost like I feel like I've found a comrade or something.

Compliments for Men?	For me, I do not need women telling me how attractive I am; it is a turn off. It does nothing to me for a woman to tell me that she is attracted to me because of my appearance. Saying something like "I am happy being here with you." or "You make me feel warm and fuzzy inside" makes me much happier than talking about superficial things like my appearance. I much prefer actions over words though. Show me that you are interested in me. Walk up behind me and brush your body against mine in public. Hold hands with me while we stand in line at the restaurant or while driving in the car. Touch my face or my body. For what it is worth, guys do get hit on by girls a lot. Women can be pretty fucking aggressive.	the only one i remember, and that mattered, was when i came out of the shower in a towel and was walking past the g/f: she said, 'whoa, hold on a second.' i'm like, 'what?' she replied, 'i just wanted to get a good look.' it was just really honest and spontaneous.
Folks who've dated someone with ADHD, how did it impact your relationship?	As a man with ADHD who feels great shame every time he forgets one of the issues generally talked about here (usually "chores") etc and works really hard to curb all the other ways it pops up that could be seen as disrespectful, this is really disheartening and a little condescending. We aren't children	I feel like I parented him and it made me anxious as I always worried how impulsive he would be or if my needs and wants were actually being heard. If anything was wrong, it would be completely ignored and it would treated as unnatural if I wasn’t in a good mood within seconds, and he couldn’t wrap his head around it. I assume he’s a fixer. He dumped me because he couldn’t handle my low points and said it made him anxious. I’m still very much feeling the aftermath of it.
How do you address your partner after they're legitimately mad because you were unfaithful in THEIR dream?	Just let her cool down lmao. She knows it's not real, she's not stupid, but the upset resulting from a vivid dream very much is. Getting all "rational skeptic" and "you and your silly woman *emotions*" on her won't help your case. *If* she starts actively acting possessive and holding you responsible/punishing you for her dream, that's when you ask her to stop and just go cool down. EDIT: I may have come off snarkier than I intended, I guess what I meant in the way of actual advice is **"Let her cool down and sort it out with her once she is calm without invalidating her feelings"**	My wife has had that dream, and she definitely wakes up pissed at me, but once she fully wakes up, she is mature enough to realize it’s a dream and we laugh about it. I’d be bothered if it affected the way she treated me for that entire day (or longer).
At what age were you the most emotionally unstable?	Aren't most people going to answer somewhere in their teens? I know I was not the most stable person at 18. Trainwreck of a first relationship with a girl who suffered from Bipolar/PTSD did that.	Between 19-21. I was clinically depressed, suicidal, in love with someone who was awful for me but I hated myself so much I needed to love someone. Crying all the time for no reason, lost a ton of weight because I stopped eating to the point that I passed out once in the street. It was a horrible couple of years.
What's that small thing that people do that you really appreciate?	Pretty much everything my SO does. He's extremely caring and always makes sure I'm taken care of. A few of the more recent ones are he went out of his way to buy me a heating pad, pain pills, and pads to leave at his place whenever I'm on my period. When I'm sick he also always makes sure I'm stocked up on cough drops, soup and medicine. I was also really sick one day and I pretty much slept all day/night. He made sure I stayed hydrated, woke me up to feed me and give me my meds on time and made sure I was warm. God I love that guy.	When we lived together, my SO would leave for work before me. I rode my bicycle to work. When I went downstairs, I'd find my bike turned around so I could walk it out the door instead of having to back it up because of the way I entered the day before. He would do all sorts of sweet things like that. We've been super long distance (Japan and US) since March after being inseparable for three years. Looking forward to reuniting in about three weeks!
What type of girl did you never think you'd end up dating but did?	A big titty half Burmese and Chinese sorority chick that loves dogs and travelling. She was hot as hell and the sex was amazing, but DAMN she was crazy and emotional. A zumba instructor hula dancing, elementary school teacher. She had a really nice ass :). It was a fun few months while it lasted.	Front-woman of a Death Metal band. Its more a hobby of her and her band-mates, but still i never would have imagined...
What prized traits in men are hardest to find?	An old-fashioned gentleman who opens doors, buys me flowers and treats me like a lady. But with a modern belief system who sees me as an equal, respects my independence and who values my opinion. VERY hard to find in the south, but I got one! :)	Guys who don't say hurtful things out of anger. It'd be nice to find a guy who will express that they're angry and then take some time away before trying to hash it out. Guys who are kind to everyone. I was recently disappointed with a male friend who was so kind to me but such an asshole to girls he was hooking up with. I found it very hard to believe that he could be completely different
How does it feel to constantly be viewed as a predator?	What happens if you cross the street and end up I front of another guy? I don't think many women view guys as predators 😅	I always make a point to walk down an extra street if I see a girl going the same direction as me late at night. I'd hate to make someone feel scared about something like that. I tend to avoid playgrounds and primary schools too because people seem to think you're a pedo if you're around those types of places. I'm a pretty young guy but I've already had mothers give me glares and ask me to move if I'm sitting on a park bench near a playground. I just tend to avoid children in general, I was walking my cousin around the city a year ago and 2 people came up to me in the span of a few hours and asked her if she "knew this man" so needless to say I just stay away from kids most of the time. It's safer that way.
Men in therapy, how did you find the right therapist for you, and where did you look?	2 things you need to know. Female therapists are gentle and indirect where male therapists are more upfront and direct. I have had both, for me l found female ones to be better at guiding me. The key though, is to keep changing till you find one your comfortable with. Best of luck to you	I went off of picture if I’m being honest. She looked happy and genuine. And off of psychology today website. First time I went off of picture and first good therapist as well.
How would you react if your SO did amateur porn?	>She says she gets off from the attention she gets Common trait of cheaters! Red flag for me. Dive into a conversation over this but dont lets these comments create a bias. Y'all need a serious talk	>About 3 months into the relationship, she stopped making videos and I didn't think anything of it. Today (year and a half into the relationship) she sent me one and said she was probably going to upload it. I don't know why, but it really is getting to me this time. This part would make me think that she once thought that the attention she got from me was satisfying her needs, but it's not enough anymore.
Academically successful men, what were your study techniques?	I never studied all the way up through my master’s. Skipped class a bunch, played a lot of video games, smoked a lot of pot, rolled in and took the exams. Normally an A or B.	Try to procrastinate as little as possible. Remind yourself that time moves faster than you think and whatever fun you are planning it's not more important than your studying.
Men whose wives or girlfriends got implants, do her boobs feel differently to you? Are you glad she got them?	Honest question from a women: How come (most?) men are attracted to implants? Doesn't it bother you that they are FAKE, and not actually "her". I.e. I couldn't be attracted to fit looking man, if i knew all of his "muscles" are actually implants.	My wife got implants about 5 years ago because she was always self conscious about her small boobs. She had her nipples centered a the same time. She now is fairly large and very happy about it. On the other hand, I'm far more attracted to small boobs than her new large ones and am now less sexually attracted to her. She also lost most of the feeling in her nipples which means that even if I was attracted to larger boobs, there would be no point in playing with them because she can't feel it anyway. Would we do it again? She says yes as she is much happier with the way she looks. I say no and wish we had never done it in the first place.
Age gap relationships. How many years is too much ?	If they're legal, you can date whoever you want. If you like elderly women and they like you, more power to you. More young women for me.	My wife is ten years older than me. We're married over 20 years. So it can work well but based on my experience I can say it's going to require a lot of tolerance on her part. And you will have to dial back your expectations back sexually, once she gets to The Change sex frequency falls off quite a bit.
What software do you pay for?	OS media for Windows 7, 8 and 10. Office 365 though I won't be renewing any time soon. Computer games. Spotify.	Videogames, and Sandboxie. Very useful application if you don't trust a particular file/program. You can also set your browser to always run sandboxed. Something gets infected? No problem, it's contained in the Sandbox. Wipe it and the problem is gone. I don't pay for most other software though, I'm not going to pay $1000 for fucking Photoshop.
I've heard of single women considering adopting a child but never a single man. Have any of you thought about it or actually gone through with it? How has that turned out?	There are a few reasons for this and YMMV among individual men but most men, if they are going to adopt and invest the time, effort, and resources into a child then they want the child to have his genes. Also, adoption agencies are very, very, very cautious about providing a child to a single man. Cuz **obviously** that man must be a child molester.	Not done it myself but I work in a field where I deal with adoptions. It is rare. I fear the system doesn't see any single man as a resource unless he has proved himself far beyond what any other adoptive resource would have to do. That said, I have nothing but positive things to say about the single men I know that have adopted. I wish there weren't such a stigma.
Besides Reddit, which social media sites do you like and why?	Twitter is essentially dead. Even when it was more popular I found it boring and frustrating to deal with. I just use Facebook because it's super easy to use.	Any social media site that I can avoid people I know in real-life on, such as Twitter and Tumblr and Reddit. I can vent or post about anything I want and I don't have to worry about people I might run into out in the real world knowing stuff about me I'd rather they not know. I find the only way to do this on sites like Facebook is to just not post at all. I'm a very private person and I wouldn't even want people knowing my base interests. My closest friends know my Twitter and Tumblr accounts, and they're about the only people I feel comfortable sharing anything with.
What would misconceptions about female sexuality would you want to clear up for a teen girl?	You can totally catch cold sores in your vagina from his face cold sores. 85% of the population has some form of herpes. You can catch herpes even if they don't have an active cold sore. Use protection, even if they say it doesn't "feel as good" without it. Don't have sex just because all your friends are doing it. They're lying, they're all virgins too.	Wanting sex is normal, as is not wanting it and preferring to wait. Your value as a human being is not dependent on whether or not you're a virgin.
What's your experience with dating religious girls vs non-religious girls?	What are these religious people of which you speak and where do I find them? I hear they believe there's a dude with a beard in the clouds watching them masturbate or something.	You are basically asking a bunch of liberal atheists what they think of dating religious girls. The general consensus will always be: "their Jesus stuff drove me crazy but she was a freak in the sheets lawl."
My parents have decided next Monday they are going to put our dog down. Never had to go through this before, how did you deal with it?	Sucks ass man, it sounds bad, but if you ever want another dog, this is the best time to get one. Otherwise you'll keep leaving it, and postponing it, so enjoy being with your dog while you can, and try and find a new one within a week, moving on quickly is the best choice.	You're lucky, I was away when my dog got put down. It sucked, I never got to say goodbye or be with him the day of. Cuddle with him, give him lots of treats and scratches, make him comfortable, and remember that he will always love you.
What's something you like as an adult that teenage you would be extremely surprised by?	monoganism beer spinach olives running having a child i think i always liked dresses, just not myself in dresses because i didn't like myself,... i guess	Adult me listens to a lot more pop music than teenage me would like Also R&B. Also pop punk lol
What is the dumbest thing you used to think about male/female anatomy or sex?	Not about human sex but I thought cats and dogs were the same species but different sex. I thought all cats were female and all dogs were male.	I didn't realize penetration was a thing. I thought the dude just pointed his penis and squirted the sperm into the woman from a few feet away. The mental imagery of this act is really, really hilarious though.
Men with highly fetishized/objectified jobs (ie. doctor, high-powered lawyer, etc), how is dating going for you? What are the unique pros and cons?	I love enginners. They're smart, funny, witty, my god every engineer I've met I'm like okay can I date you?	I'm an engineer and I've never felt fetishized. maybe it's a grass is greener thing? regardless, dating is frustrating simply because so few women are interested in the things I care about. the fact that "how does that work?" is answered so universally with "I don't care" is just disheartening. also knowing that the *overwhelming* majority of people in my profession or those like are men makes me idly wonder if I wouldn't be better off gay.
Unattractive women, what is the worst social experiences you’ve had due to your physical appearance?	In middle school, a group of girls started talking shit about me loudly because my legs were super pale. When I was a kid, an old man came up to me and told me I was so skinny that when a big wind blew, I'd be blown away. Actually a LOT of people comment about how thin I am. When I told someone about my fertility issues, they told me it was because I'm so skinny. I get a lot of comments about my weight. Always have, always will. Stopped caring, because my husband finds my body type sexy.	Probably the insults from people driving by in cars. Most of the time it's when I've been walking into a store from the parking lot but one day I was in my garage painting a dresser with the garage door open and it was people driving by my house. There's just something extra insidious about it when you're just minding your business at home.
What's something about this community that you dislike?	That 20% if the responses are men and most are women answering for their man. If I wanted the woman’s opinion I would ask there dammit.	I don't like that most questions are related to women or relationships. The best questions and answers here usually don't have a lot to do with neither of those topics.
How old are you and how much do you have in your savings account?	I'm 23, have about $700 in checking right now and no savings account. And I owe $80k in student loans.	22 and -$650. -$70,000 if we're counting student debt. I'm so jealous of everyone who replied. But one day. One day, I will be free.
How have your standards for guys changed since high school or college?	Please feel free to respond based on the genders of people you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who are attracted to men.	Please feel free to respond based on the genders of people you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who are attracted to men.
What is the most romantic date you've been on?	I'm a buzzkill, but what's romance? Can't seem to find a decent guy close by that wants anything to do with a "fat" girl. Had a guy take me to a baseball game once, which was great. Been a really looong tome since I've had a bona fide date though.	He suggested we ride bikes to the cemetery at dusk. When we got there, a bat flew in front of the full yellow moon. I brought a blanket and we sat on it and talked for hours in the dark. We were both too shy to kiss each other. Then, out of nowhere, fireworks started. Seriously. Real fireworks, for no reason we could discern, started up out of nowhere and lasted for about 5-10 minutes. After that we biked to a bar and had dinner and I kissed him. That was in August, and we're still together. (The yellow moon was from forest fires nearby. The fireworks were in celebration of a new light rail line.)
When was a time you thought “this person definitely likes me”, only to find out you were completely wrong?	Like almost every time I liked a guy in highschool. RIP. But i guess especially Chris. RIP. swore he was flirting and even our group shipped us, but then he started dating this one other girl	I was interested in a friend at university. He would accompany me on little errands and seemed to reciprocate my flirting. I asked him on a date, he said he wasn't interested in dating me. I told him I found him attractive and would be very interested in a FWB arrangement. He rejected that too. Said he wasn't interested in sexual activities outside the context of a serious relationship. We actually did wind up dating for several years, though he didn't ask me out until many months later when I was starting to meet others to try to get over him. I think he was shy and concerned I wasn't serious about him.
What's the worst first date you ever had?	I was set up on a date by one of my coworkers. I'd seen most of the people who work at the store we worked at, so I wasn't too nervous. It's important to note that I was hardly 18, and had expressed to her (whined, really) that I had never had a boyfriend or been on a date. So, I start texting with this guy she thinks will be just perfect. We decide to meet up a week later, at some restaurant. He was 27, had a kid and is currently on a break with said kid's mom. We talked about dogs and work. We parted ways amicably, and I never answered his follow up text. A month or so later I heard through the grapevine he got back together with the kid's mom.	I went on a Tinder date in January that went poorly. At the end he tried to kiss me so I dodged, tripped over a curb, and broke my fibula while falling into traffic. The guy got down in the road with me, moved my hair behind me ear and said "we could tell people that we fell in love".
Bisexuals of /r/askwomen, what are the biggest differences between how men and women eat pussy?	Women are better. At least with enough frequency that it made me stop sleeping with guys (I'm a lesbian-identified bisexual, i.e. am sexually attracted to guys but don't hook up with them anymore). Although it's possible I may just have been with some really amazing women. Edit: And I know it's not just that I've been with crappy guys, cus my straight friends have had similar experiences!	I've had more women than men down there, and I can't really tell which would have been better. I don't think gender makes a difference over experience and enthusiasm. Women who know their body well may intuitively be better at giving oral, but with communication either gender can be great.
How was your weekend?	I left the house twice... once to go see Fate of the Furious (this one I showered and got dressed for) and the second time was to literally drive once around my block to hit a Pokéstop and to catch a Pokémon so that I didn't lose my daily streak. Otherwise it was a couch-heavy weekend full of snacks, clearing out the DVR, playing Disney Emoji Blitz and a little bit of wedding planning.	My husband and I moved into our new house! And I celebrated my 30th birthday with my friends. I'm exhausted but very happy :)
Ladies! What's a neat trick you do with your make-up?	Clear mascara to keep my brows in place and a bit of light concealer in a shade one step lighter than my foundation beneath my eyes to cover up dark bags and lighten my eyes. I have warm based olive skin and I wear a bold lip just about erryday. I played around until I found a fuchsia, a red, a wine, and a hot pink that look great with my skin and now I'm bold and bright all the time. Best compliment I've ever gotten was from my bf's cousin at *her* wedding. "I love that bold lip!" Even though she looked absolutely gorgeous as well!!	Apply lipstick, blot with tissue, apply small amount of translucent powder to lips, apply lipstick again and it will stay on your lips forever (or at least for an evening!).
Men, I just found out I can no longer drive alcohol due to health reasons. What can I order at the bar other than water and soda?	Get new hobbies dude. "Oh, but muh friends". Drinking buddies are not friends. They're alcoholics who don't go to meetings.	Virgin anything. Bloody Mary (or Caesars for my Canadian homies) aren’t gonna really lack without the vodka. Other cocktails can be made virgin as well. But as far as bang for your buck goes, you might as well stick to water, because virgin cocktails are gonna cost more than they’re worth.
Men who've dated women that let themselves go during the relationship; how'd your relationship go, in that regard?	"Obviously it's her body and she can do whatever she wants with it" And it's your dick and you don't have to stick it in a hippo	I'm pretty sure that you are me, somehow posting from 10 years ago. SPOILER ALERT: It doesn't go well. You will eventually stop having sex with her and she will respond by sleeping with a guy with terrible tattoos who wears a wallet chain. After you break up, she will appear at your door one morning at like 7 am to cry about her dead rabbit. Try to act surprised.
How did you win the genetic lottery? How did you lose it?	Win: I got the highest SAT score in my graduating class (~550) with no preparation. Lose: My brother outscored me by nearly 150 points with similar prep.	Win: I can make my foot do a crackle sound that is yucky. Loss: That crackle sound that is yucky doesn't attract women.
Have you watched Hulu's adaptation of "The Handmaid's Tale"? What did you think of the first 3 episodes?	i watched the first one out of curiosity, but i think that's all i'm going to watch. it's just not my type of media.	My husband and I got into a big argument after watching the first episode because it shook me to my core and I wanted to watch the next one right away. I asked him what he thought and he said, "Ehh, it was really boring." So now I guess I'll be watching it on my own.
Dudes, when you are kissing a girl, do you go for top or bottom lip?	Top. It's already hard enough trying to kiss girls at 6'5, I'm not about to make myself have to crouch down even further. Top just makes sense, you know?	I aim for a Gaussian distribution in the X and Y planes and chart her reaction. After about 32 kisses I begin to have enough data to construct a chart which allows me to establish her preferences and focus on those. I'll send you my spreadsheet if you need a little help getting going.
For those of you who visit those community NSFW self posting subreddits such a GW why isn't there a positive representation of men on those pages?	"The female body is....a work of art. The male body is utilitarian. It's for gettin' around. It's like a Jeep!" - Elaine Benes ITT: women who hate Elaine's quote. Reminder, this isn't /u/breachofcontract's quote. It's a simple take on a simple question. Isn't the downvote button for those that don't contribute to the conversation and not a disagree button? My actual answer is posted above; it's supply and demand. Women don't demand male posters on GW as much as men demand female posters on GW.	there's /r/ladybonersgonewild also I imagine that guys who post on gw would get downvoted by straight men who are outraged at having to see a naked man.
What is your policy on paying for first dates?	I'm from Sweden. That is not custom here. We both pay because we are both there on equal terms, finding out if we like the other person. If we are at the dinner there's a chance we are already serious by now. But let's say we're not. If you expect me to pay for you. I will expect you to put out for me. Simple as that. If you're there for a paid meal I'm there for some quick pussy. We won't be seeing each other after that.	I usually go for a casual drink for a first date, although most of my dates are from online so perhaps a different situation. I always get the first drink for us. If she is game for a 2nd drink i like to see if she offers to pay, its a good quality if she does. Im always happy paying for the first drink though
What regrettable/cringeworthy thing have you done to be the "cool" girlfriend/wife?	Not sure what that means? I think I'm going to need some examples because right now, I am interpreting this as pretending to be "cool" with things I'm definitely not okay with just to be perceived as acceptable by others? ...and I just don't roll that way.	My ex had a female writing partner, which I was genuinely cool with. However, I then continued to be "cool" as I slowly realized that a) most of what they "wrote" together was essentially roleplay sex scenes and b) she was crazy jealous of me. I never questioned him about essentially having cybersex with this woman regularly - as well as a few other women - because I felt like since this was something he wanted and I didn't want to do it, I should let him get it elsewhere. But it did wind up effecting our sex life in a negative way, and my sexuality and self image as a whole.
What is the pettiest thing you've done to get back at/mildly inconvenience someone?	(Male, but sex isn't really relevant for this question, I think) I rarely get angry. I mean, the last time before this one was two years ago. Last week, a coworker said mean things to me (not about me, just *really* bad words). I didn't know how to react, since I just don't get angry. So instead, I 'punished' her for making me have to find a way to punish her. Didn't talk t her for a week. After that, I bought candies for her and shared with other employees.	I have two boxes of paper clips in my cube, the shiney newer ones and some grungy tetanus-y ones that came with my cube. When the CFO annoys or inconveniences me he gets his Monday morning reports with a tetanus clip.

If a date is late, when is it socially acceptable to leave?	If they don't show after 15-20 minutes I'm on my way to the other date I booked in that timeslot.	As a rule, I do half-hour no call, no show. If it's half an hour since we agreed to meet, and you have made no attempts to contact me, this is a horrendous waste of my time for something that you honestly weren't that interested in.
To all the lazy people of AskWomen, what's your favorite easy recipe?	I take a shovel (or spade) and dig several 2'x2' holes in my backyard near the junk pile. Gently sift through the holes with you hands and pick out worms, grubs, and insects. Put them in your pocket, and give them a good whack so they stop their squirming. Then fill the holes with some junk (this isn't necessary but you might as well do something productive) and bury it. Now you have plenty of food in your pocket to munch on throughout the day and your yards got less junk in it.	i do a lot of egg-in-a-hole-s. take a small glass (juice glasses are perfect, but who has juice glasses anymore? shot glasses are just barely too small. champagne flutes often work nicely), "cut" (press) a hole through the bread. spray a pan, heat it up, put the bread in, crack an egg in the middle, add pepper, cook one side. spray what is currently the top, and flip it over. let it cook, add a dash of salt, eat.
Why did I buy an electric razor?	Buy a good pair of clippers. Use a razor if you're looking to be clean shaven. Just don't put yourself through an electric razor. I have no idea why you bought one either; they're shit.	The thing with electric is that it will never be as close as a blade and trying to get it to be will ruin your face. I use mine dry with light pressure, just let the motor do its thing.
Women of Reddit who waited until marriage to have sex.... how do you feel about your decision looking back on it?	Perception is reality.. if you think you have a satisfying sex life, then you do. But respectfully speaking, without experiencing sex with more than one partner you really have no concept that sex with different people can be entirely different! It’s not the difference between say.. New York style pizza vs Chicago style pizza it’s more like the difference between sitting on a luxurious beach enjoying the ocean vs getting a root canal.	I don't regret waiting because I'm a bit on the asexual side and it didn't feel like a sacrifice, but I do regret the relationship.
Have you ever given oral/fingered your SO without expecting sex in return?	Stupid question. Answer is yes of course. In what kind of horrible relationship would people be unwilling to give pleasure without something in return?	Sure have. Usually I enjoy more back-and-forth, but from time to time I'll just get her off and then we can cuddle.
Those Who Have Been Gaslit, How Did You Learn To Trust Your Emotions Again?	My ex tried to gaslight me by telling me I knew she was her other lovers slave (my one, only and last poly relation). Yeah, they were in a dom/sub relationship when roommates while I lived 2 hours away. I later found out he was dropping her into subspace 2, 3 times a day and reprogramming her in his image. I don't know if i will trust again but I do know the experience changed me... and not for the better.	I became Sherlock. Started carrying a little pad of paper and pen. Wrote down specifics that he said and when. Then, when he invariably changed his answer, I could prove to myself that he was full of shit. He was full of shit. Actions speak louder than words, big time. But, words count too, when speaking of gaslighting.
How would you feel if a woman (or anyone for that matter) came up to you in public and asked if they could stick with you for a bit, because they're being harressed/feeling unsafe?	What? Honestly, men aren't around to protect you. That's not men's jobs. That's absolutely ridiculous. I would absolutely not be okay with a request like that.	It happens more than you might think, especially in places like bars and clubs. Over the years, I’ve been used that way by female friends and strangers alike, though obviously strangers a lot less. Try to pick someone who looks they they can handle themselves though. You can be bringing them a problem. Groups are good too.
Does age matter?	Hmm, I'm 29 and my SO right now is 20. There are some problems, with life experience and stuff, but he's good for me at this point in my life. Whether that will continue to be the case remains to be seen, I guess. It's the biggest age gap I've ever had in a relationship. To be honest, one of the main things that bug me about it are my asshole friends. Most of my friends will gently tease me about it, just here and there and it's just them being cute. I do have a few friends, though, where I think they WANT it to come off as cute gentle teasing, but it doesn't come off that way at all - it comes off as just...Straight up making fun of me. But they're shitty friends, I guess, and I should drop 'em. =P	It definitely can matter. I believe its more about your stage in life than your numerical age, but that rarely changes things. Occasionally yes, you can meet a 25 yr old who is VERY mature, maybe was already married young, who already has a house and job who is further in their life development than average 25 year olds and they could easily get along with someone in their 40's. But generally, if there is a big gap between age stages (i.e. college grad, just moved out of home for the first time, hooking up with 45 yr old who has two teenage children, an ex wife, is at the top of their career etc...its a HUGE gap to bridge, and I don't think if often works out well in the long term).
Do you have a 3DS? What are you playing at the moment?	I have the limited edition Zelda 3DS XL. Not the Majora's Mask one, although my boyfriend has that one and ours look so super cool next to each other. But I often joke that I have 3 children, my 2 dogs and my 3DS because I treasure it so. Lately I've also been playing New Leaf and Majora. But I also love Smash for the DS, it allows me to be introverted and still enjoy smash bros. Lately I'm into playing old games on my DS though, awhile ago I downloaded all the classic Zelda games from the Eshop for cheap and I'm finally getting to play through them now, so much classic gaming awesomeness.	I just got back into Animal Crossing. My 6 year old totally fucked up my town, so I've been spending time weeding and digging up all the shit she buried lol.
To the single ladies 30's and up, do you wish you settled in your 20's?	I got married last year, right after I turned 21. Ask me in ten years how I'm feeling about it.	Nope. All my friends who 'settled' in their 20s are divorced or unhappy. I'm 46, never been married, had two long term live in relationships, and I love my life. I answer to no one but me!
What's a dating advice that sounds good on paper but falls flat IRL?	"try actually approaching men first instead of waiting for them to approach you" i mean if they're not approaching you they probably dont want you, but ok.	Any time someone says that looks don't matter, I roll my eyes. While I don't think they should be the *only* thing that matters, physical attraction is pretty important.
What do a lot of women misunderstand about the dating experience of the "average man"?	Most of these responses are about sex.....aaaaand make the dudes saying them look like huge ass holes. Or 17 years old. I would say most chicks don't appreciate the effort guys put in. Women take for granted that they are the desired one in the situation, men are putting in effort for you to like them. So I think chicks are too quick to say "I wasn't impressed" or something like that and move on, instead of saying "he was a really nice guy, maybe a little awkward, but thats not bad maybe he was nervous".	That I actually want intimacy and not just somebody to stick my dick in. How incredibly frustrating it can be when you have to initiate everything and you're not good at it. How invisible you can feel to women who are just as average as you are or even below average. Developing feelings for a female friend can happen very easily and it doesn't mean I was just spending time with you to try and get in your pants.
How much does a girl's friends affect your decision to date her?	female friends I could care less about. Its when a chick has too many dude friends I get turned off.	I don't particularly mind unless they have a friend who really sticks their nose in. I was on track to date this girl but her mate was all "this is my girl" and always checking up on us and shit. Dipped out of that one pretty quick.
What is the worst birthday gift you've ever received?	One Christmas my mom got me an SAT study book. In her defense, I was going to be taking the SATs within the next year and I did end up getting accepted to my first choice university (besides Yale, which I mostly applied to because you never know).	My grandmother gave me a pair of used underwear for my 16th birthday. She'd had someone my size staying at her house and the girl had just left, so they got passed on to me wrapped in a nice little gift bag.
Can you french braid your own hair?	Yes when my hair was longer. It took a bit to learn and yeah your arms will hurt but you can do it. I guess the trick is take it slow and use small chunks of hair slowly gathering more the more you braid. Practice makes perfect. Oh also, I learned to do it by feel and checking my work in a mirror after.	Weirdly, I find I do better if I don't use a mirror. The mirror just confuses things. It does take a lot of practice either way, or at least it did for me.
Did you grow up with honorary "aunts" or "uncles" who you are not actually related to legally or by blood? Who are they and how did they come to be a part of your (chosen) family?	I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but when I was a kid I was best friends with this one girl, so I went to her house a lot and I always called her parents auntie/uncle. I don't talk to her anymore, but her dad is my dentist so I guess they're still a part of my life today (saving me from cavities lol)	Uncle Chuck! He was a regular when my dad ran a gunsmith and sporting goods store. After it went under, they started hanging out at home a lot. Dude was always awesome to me and my sister, treated us like nieces. We are adults now, and he still gets us Christmas and birthday presents.
What is something in men's fashion you absolutely hate and refuse to wear?	any kind of sandals/flip flops beards dress pants and dress shoes with no socks tucked in shirt with a belt cinched too tight, you look like sausage and it makes you look fatter than you are anything that doesn't fit right (baggy pants, skinny jeans, XX shirts when you should be wearing a medium etc)	Most things with a logo. If it's unavoidable (like with athletic wear), it's going to be minimal. Anything that's supposed to be funny. Every time you wear that 'hilarious' t-shirt, I feel like you're just repeating the same joke.
Dog pulled and gf fell and hit her face out on a walk. Probably gonna bruise up. How do I not look like a wife beater when we go out?	You're overthinking this. People who are too quick to meddle or make this kind of assumption have no life and deserve no attention.	People are gonna look and judge, such is life mate. Some women will probably come up and slip her a help line number, that's about it.
Apparently, the co-founder of Tinder is creating a "women-first" dating app where women must make the first move. What are your first impressions of this idea?	It will fail. Women are incredibly lazy when it comes to relationships as they carry the power. Its a game to them.	Seems like it will be self-selecting, and rather than encouraging more women to take the initiative it will just appeal to those who already do. Women who don't want to initiate contact will continue to have the option of every single other dating site/app where they don't have to.
What's the dumbest thing you've ever done while intoxicated that could have ended very badly, but thankfully didn't?	While not a woman, about the dumbest thing I've witnessed. I was working as a line cook at a well known college bar and closed at 1am but left closer to 1:30. It was snowing heavily (being February in Colorado) and I took my mom's SUV to work since my parents were out of town. These two petite women approach me while I'm cleaning snow off the windshield asking me for a ride home miles away. They were very clearly drunk. It blew my mind! I was an athletic 6'2" and I'm the one you all for a ride? Of course I drove them home. Found out later they were roommates with a busser at my restaurant. She thanked me later and said they're kind of stupid that way. :/	I got so drunk that I fully passed out on the toilet in the bar bathroom. I am absolutely horrified by the memory, and thank the freaking lord one of the girls in my group absolutely insisted on finding me before she was willing to go home. There's no real excuse, people were buying me drinks that night, and I didn't really think about how much I was consuming. It's been about 4 years, and I have never gotten even close to that drunk since
Do you keep people around as friends that you have slept with in the past? If so, how does that affect your current relationship?	Of course. Otherwise, I'd have, like, no friends. It doesn't affect my current relationships, as far as I can tell. I mean, my partners are friends with them, too.	Nope. They're in the past and all live far away. Except for that one guy who now lives with my sister. That was kinda awkward for a while.
Men, can just a person's smell turn you on?	Every time my boy told me I smell great, I wondered if my smell was really special or if he just dated crappy women who smelled terrible.	I can walk down a street, see someone, think meh, then walk past and smell them and think, omg she is delicous. Usually perfume related, but yes a smell is a turn on... or off
What's the hardest thing you and a significant other have endured together?	We lost someone very close to us a little while back. He didn't mean for anyone to get hurt, he just wanted to play. We miss you everyday, Harambe.	Cancer. My wife is currently recovering from vaginal cancer. It's fucking terrible but we are hoping to hear "cancer free" in a couple of months. What most people don't know is that the side effects of chemo and radiation are terrible but the worst part is that some side effects can become permanent so we will be dealing with this for the rest of our lives. She is 31 and has already had surgery on her cervix that was supposed to lower her risk but actual cancer in the vagina is pretty rare (as opposed to her ovaries or cervix) and women who do get it are typically over 50. As the radiation has made it pretty much impossible for her to get pregnant I am thankful we have already had kids and I'm hoping to get "back to normal" by Christmas.
What's the weirdest thing you dealt with when moving in with your SO?	I’ve liked with my wife since I was 16 (34 now) and can honestly say that there was never a thing that bothered me.	I was not prepared for how much hair I would find all over the house. On the floor, in the sink, on furniture, in the fridge, etc.
Do you find a person more physical attractive the more you socially interact with that them?	Physically attractive? Nope. That is decided in the first 10 seconds or so of me seeing their face. It can be changed with diet, exercise, or different attire/makeup, however. That said, it is nice to see a girl or boy having a quick whit about them. A sense of humor or a well placed pun will make me respect them more.	Yes. I tend to see the positives of their body more and ignore the negatives. It helps when I can confirm that she doesn't mind talking to me vs. before when I had no idea if she'd be annoyed at my mere existence. This has happened to me with numerous girls at work.
Students and young professionals: do you ever feel overwhelmed, distracted, worried about spending your time doing the "right" things?	This happens to me constantly. I am 26 and I would say I am pretty successful in my career. I am worried about how productive I am all the time. This is not so much of a burden because my job actually make a me very happy and gives me a feeling of satisfaction. As I've grown, I have the feeling that I should prioritize relationships and health much more than what I have in the past. Particularly in the relationships aspect...I have friends and my family but I have never been in a relationship so it is something that I now feel must change. Not because I am incomplete or because I need a man to look after me.... just because I think a romanticrelationship is an important part of the development of a person and I have missed out all my life	Constantly. I always feel guilty when I'm not studying, applying for jobs, networking, researching, etc. I do feel really great when I get home at the end of the day, tired from doing school work but it can be overwhelming if I don't take breaks. I learned to realize that I do better when I take some time to myself every day/week. It could be an hour a day or one day out of the weekend.
Fathers of askmen. You come home from work and see your 8 year old son has taken a golf club to your 40 year old project car. What do you do?	Beat his ass. Take all his toys. Beat his ass. Ground him. Beat his ass. Explain to him just how much he fucked up and try to understand his stunted and retarded 8 year old brain (he should be old enough to know better). Beat his ass and send him to bed with no dinner. Wait for him to fall asleep then wake him up with some more whoopings	I'm not a father but I'd assume you'd want to murder that little bastard and just start over? 8 years doesn't seem very long to do it all again.
Would you want to know if your SO made a one night mistake and made out with someone else on a night out? Why or why not?	Lol you got dumped because you whored it up one night, didn't you? My answer: You better take it to your grave because I'm leaving you if you tell me.	I'd want to know, purely because secrets usually come out eventually and it's better finding out now than in 2 years time
What's the most dangerous/stupidest situation you've put yourself in?	It was exam week and I had a half day from school. My ex texted me and told me to meet him at the pool where we were both on swim team because he had been dropped off there early and was bored. I told him no because I didn't trust him but he kept texting me and bothering me and he said we could just sit around and play cards and talk. I started feeling really bad for him so I went over there. It was a terrible position because we were in the booth where the people do the sound at swim meets and nobody was there and nobody could see us. Terrible day.	I once rode with a drunk driver. I didn't realize how drunk he was until he swerved into oncoming traffic.
How do I break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend?	Wow @ all the commenters who say "record the conversation" or "call the cops". I can understand where it's coming from, but what a cynical way to approach things. That said, you seem to be on top of things, actually. You know this situation is bad for you and you want out, and you seem determined to do it. The only advice I can give is that if she has any support anywhere-- other friends or maybe another family member-- give them a heads up just after you break up with her, so they can look out for her a bit. Good luck.	First rule of any relationship/friendship/whatever: never let yourself be pulled into the water while trying to save them from drowning. You come first. **Period.** If being with her is negatively affecting you, then you need to end it. As for how to actually do so, I don't know. Soon and definite (don't give her any wiggle room to deny its over) is just about the only advice I can give.
What is your biggest "flaw" to your SO?	That I refuse to eat tuna fish. He tries to get me to have a bite of his sandwich each time he makes a tuna melt. I keep saying *more for you* but no. It's a personal challenge to try to get me to not just try tuna, but to enjoy it also. Ewww.	He says I'm a messy cleaner. For instance, I will vacuum the whole house, then leave the vacuum in the middle of the room I finished last. Or I'll clean the bathroom but leave all the bottles of cleaner on the counter. He says he can't *really* complain because I do most of the cleaning in our house but I know it drives him nuts. He usually just follows behind an hour later and tidies up after me.
What are your home maintenance and cleaning hacks?	I just don't. No, I should take the time to do my dishes every night and wipe off the counters, I know it. But I don't. I'd rather spend a Sunday morning, music loud, and clean the crap out of my house.	Here is the best tip I've EVER learned: Set aside 10 minutes every night to do some cleaning. I mean it. 10 minutes only. Set a timer and clean until the dinger goes off. You'll be surprised how much you can get done in that time-- picking things up, cleaning the toilet or wiping off the sink really quick, throwing dirty clothes in the hamper, emptying the dishwasher, whatever. Don't start anything you can't get done in 10 minutes. 10 minutes is the STRICT LIMIT. Things like loads of laundry or floor-mopping can be done on weekends. But every weeknight just do 10 minutes of quick cleaning and you'll be shocked at how clean your house is most of the time.
How do you stop yourself from crying in tense situations?	Tbh I try to thing about smth else but I've had times where I just keep crying ,calm down, then start crying again. I've skipped school days because of it.	Honestly? I do math. Look away from whatever is making you feel this way(esp if it’s a person- god knows looking at them doesn’t help) and pick any number at random. I usually use 400 and up, then find the square root. What’s the smallest factor you can find? Make it a fraction, how can you simplify it? Simplified it? Add them together, multiple by 13 and start over. It sounds dumb, but as someone who had to learn from a young age that crying is “a sign of weakness” this has been my saving grace. I hope it helps you. Edit: words r hard Edit 2: Silver!! I’m rich! But also, thank you stranger!
How would you feel about your long-term SO being constantly nude around the house?	1. Don't bring other subreddit in here. We don't want to deal with that kind of shit. 2. Some people like being nude, some people don't. The couple should discuss these things among themselves and come to a mutual agreement. Everybody else can tie their opinion to a rock and throw it into the sea.	You can't fart when you're sitting on the couch if you're naked. Those are the rules and they are strictly imposed.
at what age did you realize you were "older"?	i am. also realized i can no longer go for girls who are under 22. &#x200B; Shame on you, you most certainly can go for younger women, my wife is 5 years younger than me and it's no big deal and I know lots of guys married to women 5-10 years younger than themselves. As far as age, maybe 15-20 years makes a difference but 5-10 years has never been a nonstarter, women tend to be a little more mature than us guys so being a few years older allows us to "even-up" so to speak.	I think when I hit 27 and I randomly decided to stay home one Friday night because it had been a long, stressful week.
Poor &amp; Working Class Women, what are some things your middle class &amp; upper, etc friends or family just do not understand?	They all think being a solo mother who has an above minimum wage job is fine and I should be able to rent on my own, in the city. Loving with my parents and commuting 4 hours a day is financially cheaper. It's not emotionally cheaper, I missed out on my kids first f word (it's a dark, inside joke. Welcome to the inside.) My drive to search for a partner in the past was just general loneliness... Now and for many women like me, it's a desperate drive to survive. Even if we do pay our own way.	Ordering additional things at a restaurant and then just saying "oh, we'll split the bill". What I ordered is what I can afford. I can't afford to split the bill when you've added three more sides and another round of drinks.
Men who basically swim in pussy - what's it like?	Better than being in a relationship, honestly. I don't really care for those... women seem to crave attention and emotional closeness, so even if you're just fucking them, they'll still act like you're girlfriend, but you don't have to act like their boyfriend. It's nice. They'll buy you food and other stuff, fuck you, play with your hair, then ask why you don't call them back. Honestly I'm happiest when I'm screwing two or three different women on rotation. Also makes it easier to deal with their childish behavior.	I want a girlfriend but can't seem to get one. During work today I was texting some girl. We made a plan for her to come to my place after I finished at the gym. She brought a bottle of wine. We drank it and chatted. Then we had sex, she got dressed, and left. I have a couple of other women who'd do something similar for me. A few years ago I'd have thought that such an arrangement was living the dream. But I'm here alone and I just feel hollow. The instant gratification of a hookup is nowhere close to the feeling of sleeping with someone you really care about.
Do you feel like modern dating problems are due to men being taught to respect women, but not how to court them?	Man, I read your post, and you have a lot of responses, but I feel the need to point out some things about your language that might be worth thinking about. You talk about wanting a mate and wanting to "woo" women. You sound like some kind of national geographic special where the male shows his plumes to attract a mate. Seriously, just be yourself, whether I'm a guy that wants to be your friend or a girl that wants to get to know you, be yourself.	Decreased social interaction = less time developing social skills. Higher exposure to perfect TV social interaction = association with their actions being correct = incorrect application of social skills to real life situations.
What is the craziest conspiracy theory you ever heard that a friend/family member genuinely believed?	If you don't say the line "Jesus Christ is my personal Lord and Savior," this ostensibly all-loving creature will burn you in a fiery pit not just once, but ... brace yourself ... for *eternity.* And torture you and stuff. Like, forever. Legitimately.	My Grandmother was convinced that the Space Shuttles were causing the hole in the ozone layer. Like, they were physically tearing a hole in the ozone when they went to space.
What’s romanticized in modern culture but really shouldn’t be?	I wouldn’t say romanticized but I DESPISE how being late is becoming normalized. People who are consistently late to everything in their lives baffle me. I don’t know how you expect to hold a job or even hold onto your friends if you keep disrespecting them by completely disregarding time management because it’s “cute”.	Having a bigger house. My 3 bedroom ranch house is enough for my family. If I had more kids than I would need another bedroom but think we're done with two. It also doesn't break my bank. I can afford my mortgage and extra stuff BECAUSE I haven't 'moved up'. People at work are always whining about how broke they are, but I'm sure their mortgages are 1.5x what mine is. Sure we could afford a bigger house, but why? So that our bank account can't grow? So that I can say my house has 4-5 bedrooms and is 3500+ sq. feet? Doesn't seem important to me.
Women gamers, what kind of situations have you been in that made you wish you had kept your gender a secret?	Too often. I'm trans and my voice is not entirely masculine or feminine, and often when I speak on voice comms it gets mentioned. "Are you a chick or a dude?" etc. And I either tell them I'm a woman, and then the trans comments start, or I go silent and lose out on voice comms or people keep making a thing of it if I just ignore the question.	So I don’t really play online games like MOBAs anymore after some bad experiences. Basically if people found out I was a girl, one of three things often happened: - one or more of my team would spend the whole game around me ‘protecting’ me like I was some high value target - some guys would just hang round me in the game like a weird form of flirting. Like I’d want to either date them or sleep with them. - If the other team found out I was a girl, some of them would stalk me for easy kills. Plus, if we lost it tended to be my fault! There were occasions where people would be like “she’s a girl.....cool” and play on. But what I described above happened enough to be annoying and off-putting.
Mentally Ill ladies, how do you cope?	Very interesting question... but IMHO, I think we're all mentally ill to some degree. I'm one of the most genuinely happy people you'll ever cross in life, but have been seeing different therapists since i was 7 years old because of OCD related to a relentless phobia. If i'm being honest, therapy didn't help me much. *Connecting with other people, talking and listening to others share their vulnerabilities, that's what truly has helped me.* OCD, GAD, 15 years	Generalised Anxiety Disorder - Originally therapy to get a better handle on things, but (probably not what you want to hear) ignorance these days. I pay attention to my own signs, but I'm so petrified of anyone else seeing me as broken I have perfected the art of the "mask". I am the duck. Everyone sees the serene tranquil duck floating on the water. I don't let anyone one see how frantically I'm scrabbling underneath to maintain that facade.
What dating advice did your father/mother give you that was very usefull or very useless?	ITT: My parents never gave me advice. So I don't have anything to add to this conversation except writing a completely useless fucking comment, sorry bye I mean really people....?	My best friends mom was a model most of her life and this is what she told me in highschool. "That absolutely gorgeous girl that you have no shot with because she is way out of you league? Go for her. Because everyone else things that same thing or is too intimidated by her looks to approach her so she is probably single. If she shoots you down because of her looks then you're lucky​ you found out her personality sooner." She also brought me to photo shoots to force me to spend a lot of time around attractive woman. Learned how to be comfortable and myself around them.
Have you ever had a dream which makes you sad after you wake up?	Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?	Had a dream where I ran into someone who had stopped talking to me that I missed very much. We caught up and it felt so good, I woke up feeling so much joy because it had been so vivid. After a few seconds I realized I was still in my room and I had just woken up, and wave of intense sadness washed over me.
What NON GENDER double standard annoys you the most?	When a religious person talks about his religion, puts up posters about it outside, ring all the church bells, azan and alike to whole neighborhood it's "belief liberty", but when atheists say religions suck, they do harm, are not real, we get accused by being disrespectful to other beliefs and with hate.	People who say that hard work is admirable and wonderful but treat poor people badly and say that they're lazy. Poor people work super hard to make ends meet. What they're really saying is "only some types of work are worthy", which is really disgusting.
Women over 35, what's some advice you received when younger that you ignored that you wish you hadn't?	"Don't shave your legs." My mother told me this when I was younger (I didn't listen). She never shaved her legs and has always had super-fine light colored hair that makes it look like she doesn't even have any. Me? If I don't shave now, I look like Chewbacca (except with darker hair). Should have listened to Mom. :/ Edit: I just wanted to clear something up. My response here is a valid (though anectdotal) situation that actually did happen. Yes, I realize the myths that many people believe about hair getting darker, etc. Yes, I realize that me following along with what my mother did might not have yielded the same result. Still, it was always an interesting concept - and it worked wonders for Mom. I just answered the question that was asked, as it pertains to me. Downvoting doesn't even make sense.	Brush your teeth. Seriously. The second set have a limited warranty and you really don't want to have to get expensive dental work when you're 40. (Edit - Also, floss. You only floss the teeth you want to keep. Thanks /u/yogurtmeh) Wear sunscreen. Even when it is cloudy. Skin cancer is no joke. Make sure you get the backs of your hands and the tops of your feet. He is not worth ruining your life for. Either is she. The only one who puts you first is you unless you get really, really stupidly lucky. Call your parents.
Just broke up with SO of a year, and he didn't even react. Has anyone else has a similar experience?	Why would him feeling bad make you feel better? You ended the relationship. If you had unfinished business you should have taken care of that before you decided to break up with him. Sorry for being blunt, but I have little patience for people who use breakups as a way to manipulate their relationships, which is what it sounds like you tried to do.	Not everyone processes emotional trauma in the same way. A friend of mine is a trauma surgeon. Sometimes he has to be the one to deliver the bad news to husbands, wives, parents, family members and loved ones. He’s told people their child has just died and received nothing back but a blank stare. Or seen people react to the bad news with seeming indifference. And he’s seen people become hysterical to the point they had to be medicated. In each case, I doubt it was that they didn’t care their child, wife, husband, etc., had just died. People just process trauma in different ways, and the same may well apply to your situation.
I see a lot of posts about bad/creepy interactions with guys. What are your positive/good interactions with them?	One time I was carrying a package into the post office and there were two sets of doors. 4 different guys held the door open for me coming in and out!!! I never even had to touch the door! I felt like such a woman.	Most of my interactions with men are positive and respectful. I have several lovely male coworkers, a lot of my close friends are guys, my neighbors are wonderful, most of my contact with men I do not already know - polite and pleasant. At least 95% of my interactions with men are nice, or at the minimum neutral. For me, it is just that the smaller number of unpleasant encounters stand out more for both their relative rarity and negative impact.
Which animal's mating ritual are you most glad is NOT the way WE seduce each other?	Female hyenas have a penis-like structure they can rape the males with. Though I think it would be cool to have a prehensile penis-like appendage, I don’t think raping my mate would put him in the mood.	Male moose pee in the dirt and then roll around in the urine mud puddle they made. The female moose find this very arousing and are drawn to the delightful scent. They soon mate. I am glad men do not roll around in their urine in the mud and expect us to find that attractive.
Your SO doesn’t initiate intimacy. How big of a deal is this to you and what goes through your head when this happens ?	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who date men.	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who date men.
How many drinks/beers do you have a day?	OP you know damn well it's not healthy and that you should cut back... otherwise you wouldn't even have bothered to ask	Most people don't drink every day. 15% of people over 18 have never had a drink. about 30% of the population won't typically drink during the year. about 44% won't drink every month. at 2-3 beers a day you are into the top 10% of American Alcohol consumers (assuming you are American) the cutoff for which is 15 a week.
What would you add to the list of these 'Women are in Charge of Their Bodies' posters?	I would want to see a dose of reality. Yes, it is your body and your decision, but decisions have consequences. Defying social convention will make you an outsider, and these posters don't recognize that. Each poster takes a piece of femininity and says "you are special and this doesn't apply to you if you don't want it to". But that is a lie. But maybe that is a feature, not a "bug", of the posters? I personally would be progressively unattracted to a woman as more of the poster content were to be cumulatively applied to one person. Maybe a disclaimer is needed at the bottom of the posters?	Women who don't have kids!! I'm not a selfish sociopath kid-hater who's going to die alone and have my cat eat my face.

Users are not here to give or receive advice, drug prescription or diagnostics of any kind. Please report any rule-breaking comments.	Please note that **we do not allow medical advice of any kind**.

Would you be upset if your SO still wore jewelry from a previous relationship?	Heart ring? Yeah, don't do that. Actually, i would personally prefer that anyone i was involved in got rid of stuff from previous SOs entirely, but i guess that might be a bit extreme. Mementos are big fucking no though. If it has special meaning, it would upset me.	I don't really care. I still wear the clothes that my exgirlfriend bought me. I'm not going to throw away gifts from an old lover, and I certainly don't expect her to either. I'm not going to freak out about jewelry unless it's like a pendant with his face in it.
How much hair do you naturally have on your buttocks?	Incredibly light vellus hair, but when I was a teenager I thought I literally had more than any other girl and I must have too much testosterone or something.	On the cheeks, not much. Between the cheeks it's a jungle, man. Lots of super dark, thick hair all the way to the top of the crack.
What are some common "millennial problems" that you can't understand or relate to?	I dont understand or believe the people that say they cant get a job that pays more than minimum wage. My gf got a minimum wage job and got a $1.5 raise within the year, and she has applied for insurance jobs and has already gotten 3/4 interviews. They pay $12-15. You can get a job that pays more than minimum wage, it just may not be at the place youre at now. You'll have to man up and leave familiarity.	I'm a millennial, and I can't relate to most of the problems non-millennials think we have, or the reasons they think we have them.
What's you favorite part of being an Aunt?	I love that I get to do all the fun stuff and then hand my nephew back to mom when he starts to get cranky. Absolute favorite part of being an aunt is never having to be "the bad guy."	I’m an aunt to 12 nieces and nephews. I first became an aunt when I was 15 and I’m 40 now. To be honest, I prefer it now they’re mostly older. I’ve never been a fan of babies and toddlers, so once they were over 10 years old, I got on better with them and enjoyed talking to them. Christmas is a financial nightmare though!
What class have you taken (high school or college) that you thought you would hate but ended up loving?	I was briefly salty about having to take a year of Latin when I was 13 (no, this was not a religious school). I **friggin** loved it. Continued all through High School. Took AP Latin. Went to college, studied Latin all through college. First job was a Latin tutor in college. It was my minor. Still love it!	I took calculus my senior year of high school and expected to hate it, but it was one of the most fun classes I've ever taken. Our teacher was brilliant but batshit insane (in the best way) , the class was full of all my friends, and calculus was like solving puzzles. I loved it.
I'm a girl, curious to know what makes a girl 'complicated/hard to read'?	In general, males will give direct answers and work to fix problems directly instead of circlejerking about "my feelings" and "my emotions" as if your stupid illogical inferior emotions determine what is fact and what isn't fact. i.e. females who complain about something and then bitch when a male fixes the problem or gives advice to fix the problem. [here's an example of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4EDhdAHrOg)	One ex admitted to me that whenever she feels like she's not getting enough attention she will never directly ask for it. Instead she will start an argument about *something completely different* and the man is just supposed to guess that she actually just wants positive attention. I feel bad for the guy she ended up with.
When did confidence finally happen for you?	I am all that like you, but I found out that the mindset is important. I don't have a girlfriend but will having one change my life in anyway towards an absolute betterment? No. Nothing will do that. I've just accepted that I prefer being alone and I'm okay with it. Comparison is no good. The second you start doing that, you see the things that you don't have. After realizing that my confidence has gotten better. Also I'm seeing gainz so that's a plus seeing your hardwork paying off.	Lost a lot of weight and finally started properly looking after myself. I have a proper haircut now, wear fitting, nice clothing and such things. I can clearly notice that my environment now pays a lot more attention to me.
What do you ladies think about the allegations against Aziz Ansari?	She was brave to share her story with the entire world and will undoubtedly be shamed, harrassed, and victim blamed. He ignored her nonverbal cues and treated her basically like a peice of meat. When he realized she wanted to be treated with dignity and respect by her VERBALLY INDICATING HER BEING UNCOMFORTABLE, what did he do? Apologize and get her a cab? No, he poured more alcohol. Just because he pretends to be a "woke" celebrity doesn't give him a pass. He should be marked as a Sexual Predator along with the likes of Louis CK and Harvey Weinstein.	He's an asshole, not a rapist. I am interested in finding out if this is part of a pattern of disgusting behavior, or an isolated incident.
Attractive men of AskMen, what are your biggest challenges with women, while single or in a relationship?	Attractive men are probably not lurking on a sub full of socially awkward, out of touch young men. Part of attractiveness is having a rich and fulfilling life. That probably includes activities. Outside.	When you ask if a guy is attractive, keep in mind 90% of guys who call themselves attractive aren't really that attractive, they just have a decent face and aren't fat. Their experience will differ completely from a guy with a body like the statue of David. The major difference I've noticed from personal experience pre-fitness and post-fitness, as well as talking to other guys who are actually in shape, is that women send signals much more clearly when you're in shape. They will either smile at you a lot, make excuses to talk to you, or flat out hit on you. Whereas as a normal 'attractive' guy without an impressive physique, you can get girls but you have to do the work.
Let's not be serious for a second here: If you were in an RPG, what class would you be and why?	Y'all need to roll the dice and roleplay whatever dimwitted combination of improbable you happen to get. *Stop worrying; there are no winners, there are no losers. This ain't a game dear, this is a role play game. Woman up and roll the dice* -Me, a couple of hours ago	Reading through this thread is great and fun and fine and all until I realize, "Shit...this is why I can't find any tanks."
(M) I don't chase, I feel like I'll be alone forever because of it. How do I break out of this?	/r/MGTOW there is nothing at all wrong with not chasing. You can date if you want, but only on your terms. Avoid long term relationships. Never ever marry. At 28, you're starting to build up your wealth. Do NOT give half or more of it away to some skank.	As a guy, you can expect to kiss zero girls if you never go in for the kiss. Now before you debunk that as a false absolute, which it is, that is to mean that most girls are out there waiting to be plucked. They almost all feel like you. You won't meet the ones that don't in a meaningful way unless you get some experience and confidence, and for that, you gotta go steal some hearts. Don't buy into this hope will make good things happen bullshit Hollywood sells us. The world doesn't give a shit about any of us. If we want good things to happen, we need to *make* them happen. Waiting around for what you want to just appear is putting your happiness into the hands of a very improbable dice roll.
Do you ever have days where you just say to yourself "Omg Enough female sexuality! I can't take it anymore!"?	To be frank: no, I don't think that. In regards to reddit: I understand that a majority of the users are straight and male and adjust my opinions accordingly. I know that will skew how much female sexually gets posted here.	If I have to see another picture/video of Kate Upton strutting around in those Game of War or whatever it's called ads with her boobs hanging out I'm gonna throw up. It's not even because I find boobs gross; I identify strongly as bisexual. It's more the thought of "hey, let's sell young boys/teenagers on this game through boobs and objectification!" that disgusts me.
What double standards have you come across in your relationships, and how did you deal with them?	I'm pretty sure all the double standards in my relationship are to my benefit, so I don't want to think too hard about what they are or I might have to do something about them... I mean, my SO hasn't complained about any, so it's fine, right?	I hate it when if I'm out w/o my husband and kids people say something like, "your husband is babysitting the kids tonight." Nope, he's parenting. Just like I do when he's not around. Edit: patenting-->parenting
Any women here whose periods/hormonal cycles have zero sway over their emotions?	I am exactly like you. I've always wondered if some women play up the emotion thing, because I've bled for 35 years (not continually, obviously), and my emotions have never run amok because of my periods.	Yeah, I cannot say that it really impacts my emotional state in some way that I feel overly emotional or let them run out of control. If anything, the only change in my personality is that I'm pissed off because I feel gross or in pain from the cramps and it is keeping me from getting things done like normal.
My fiancée has entered the third trimester, how do I become the best father to my son?	Be there, don't baby him, and be a masculine role model. Nothing worse than a guy who runs off, doesn't give tough love when it's deserved, and doesn't teach his son that it's okay to be man. Don't take that last line as "toxic masculinity", it's a serious issue. Men are being raised in such a way that they end up withdrawn from the world, not feeling they fit. Teach him to be a man; a man's man.	Don't leave the education of your son entirely up to the education system. Find good books for your son to read. Teach him things that will benefit him in the real world. Provide learning experiences.
How much of a man's attractiveness do you think is under his control?	My opinions: A guy with a 4/10 face (ugly features, no chin, etc) can look kind of okay with a good haircut, good clothes, and if he's tall, but definitely not "wow, he's hot". Similarly, a short guy is never ever going to get a "wow he's hot" response from me. tl;dr not to me, no.	It's very possible. Most guys who are unattractive simply need to lose weight, lift weights, get a new hairstyle, improve their hygiene, or a combination of those and it would take them from a 3 to an easy 7+.
What does depression feel like to you, personally?	It feels like I'm struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. No matter how hard I tread, I keep getting sucked down. ... this is why I take meds.	Like all the colour has melted out of the world, and there is this glass wall around you that allows you to be in the world but not really engage with it. And everything is muted by the voices in your head telling you how worthless you are, how pointless everything is, how little anything matters. It also feels like being so tired your bones ache, all the time.
I seem to recall some of you have moissanite engagement rings - how are they holding up?	Have you thought about getting a sapphire? Why get something that people will look at and think is a diamond if you don't actually want a diamond?	I just wanted to pop in and comment as a geologist. On a 1-10 scale of hardness (10 being diamonds) Moissanite is a 9.5. So it should hold up very well. That is of course dependent on how pure the stone is and that no imperfections exist. Therefore, as long as you use a reputable dealer I think it's a great choice! You'll save a ton of money and it will look gorgeous for the rest of your life. Congrats!
What are some of the hypocrisy men/women display in bed ?	It seems the oral issue is very widespread. Women, I hope you know there are exceptions. I (male) do not enjoy receiving oral, and giving oral is actually my favorite part of sex.	A lot of men expect women to spend a lot of time on hair removal but don't do any of their own. Also, the kind who expect oral sex to be given to them by women but always have some excuse for why they can't reciprocate or act like it's such a difficult chore that they should be getting a medal for or.
Ladies who look healthy but are dealing with an “invisible illness” (mental or physical), what is your story?	I have multiple mental illnesses, insulin resistance, possible endometriosis, and a serious thyroid issue. I’ve struggled for years trying to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it to have the best life I could. I’ll always need to be on medication. And I’ll most likely always be effected by ptsd and anxiety/bipolar disorder. But my meds and therapy have helped dramatically.	Chronic fatigue, chronic gastritis, chronic nausea, chronic vomiting, chronic pain, chronic insomnia, chronic depression. I'm in the food service industry, probably twice as old as most of my co-workers, and I still show up to every shift with a grit-my-teeth determination to not let my problems show, and I run circles around some of them. Guess I'm kind of a master at hiding shit. For sure though, I'm very tired of always trying to appear strong, healthy and happy
What is your most problem part of your body when it comes to fitting into clothes?	I’m too small for western sized clothes. Sometimes XS is too big… Edit: I live in Sweden. Shoes and clothes my size are considered children-sized. My clothing style (modern goth) only have sizes for “somewhat obese” people in the stores here and it’s so frustrating!	Most skinny jeans are too tight for my calves. If I buy a bigger size then it’s too big for my waist and thighs. I’m pretty short so wearing flared jeans make me feel even shorter so prefer skinny jeans.
Why aren't trophy husbands more popular?	Because men are shallow idiots when it comes to dating. But there is a deepness to that shallow nature. We find our therapy in sex wayyyy more than women do. Women seek out money and stability. Men seek out sexual therapy- or, in other words, they treat sex as a way to feel better. Women see things like financial stability, wealth, etc. as a way to feel better. To feel protected, I guess. (Of course, that is a generalization and everyone is different. For me personally... No matter how rich or successful I got, I don't think I'd ever consider a trophy wife.)	A trophy husband is a rich and successful man. You earn this trophy by being a very hot and not necessarily bright woman.
Cat owners, what has your experience been?	I love one of my cats, I tolerate the other. I treat them the same, but I regret getting the second one. She's moody and weird, something we chalk up to her being taken from her mom at 3 weeks old. If I believed in putting cats outside for good she'd probably be a permanently outdoor cat. She's gone outside for a couple days during the day at a stretch when she tore the shit out of my arm for no apparent reason. If she ever does that to my kids, though, she's gone for good. I can understand defensive scratching, if my kids mess with her and she scratches and runs, fine. She's the kind of cat who has a note on file at the vet's office for how unnecessarily aggressive she can be.	Mostly frustration and caving to their needs, the little assholes. Seriously: They're the best. My cats got fleas recently and it's been a really trying ordeal because it's a longterm problem and I've never dealt with it. Sometimes they are sick, sometimes they are super affectionate, sometimes they couldn't give less of a fuck about me. But I love them unconditionally. They're my cats and I'm their human. **Edit:** Y'all are flea experts and I love you all.
When you stopped looking for love and focused on yourself, what happened?	I found love. Went the same way with all of my relationships so far. Love finds YOU, when you are not looking.	Uhhhh what they always say will happen happened. I was single, not looking to mingle, just working and doing the things i enjoyed. I said sure why not to a blind date as a favor to a friend and the guy and I could NOT have had less chemistry. We had a nice dinner and then both texted our mutual friend 'thanks but no thanks.' The guy then followed up with 'But I think she would really hit it off with my best friend...' and within 18 months I was married to the best friend.
Women who have been in relationships for 10+ years, what are some ways your partner shows you that they're still in love with you?	Not married. Or in a relationship. But I've been going through these comments and just thinking to myself "damn i guess all the good guys really have been taken from this world" Edit: I'm 16 if you were wondering	Me and my fella have been together 13 years today and we try and do the following: He calls me beautiful every day, even when I'm ill He'll make sure there's food in after a long shift if he's not going to be home He's my biggest cheerleader in everything I do. He still makes me laugh like we did when we were 16years old Cooks me breakfast in bed when we are off together. Makes time for us, despite our busy and often conflicting schedules He'll dress up for dates
Late-bloomers: Do you ever feel sad for missing out on "young love" and what it entails?	You missed out on what sex? That's all young love really boils down to. You're not gonna move into together, you're not taking trips together (most likely), you aren't going to clubs together, not old enough to drink somewhere, you can't do a lot of the things you can once you're dating in your twenties. I'll admit it was fun but I could've done without things like pregnancy scares, break ups, or those unbearable moments of seeing your ex somewhere and getting depressed because she's moved on. Trust me brother you didn't miss much.	I think you just have to accept that. There are probably a lot of other human experiences that you're missing out on too, and the people who got to have young love missed out on a lot of the great experiences you've had. Personally, I've never had sex, but I've been to over 30 countries and currently live in New York City (which I love, though maybe it isn't for you). Sure, it would be nice to have sex, and it probably would have been nice to have experienced awkward teen romance. I didn't. I can't undo that. But there's a lot more to my life than having missed that.
Women who are/were fans of "The Sims", which version and/or expansion was your favourite?	I liked the first one best. But I recently downloaded sim city on my phone and it's even better. :)	Sims 2. It wasn't perfect, but I really loved how weird it was, and Open for Business was great. I do still love Sims 3 - the customisation and open world were fantastic additions - but it ran like shit on my computer, I had to download tons of mods just to get it to work, and the sims themselves were ugly as hell. So Sims 2 it is.
My fellow fellas, how do you feel about the idea of adult play parks?	Well the first thing that came to my mind was an "adult play" park, that encouraged "adult play." If that's what you're talking about then I'm all for it. I'd love to be bent over on a jungle gym and let a hung stud have his way with me and fill me up.	Honestly... I think it's an AMAZING idea. I could see this really taking off: Like... a GIANT area with a massive network of monkey bars, slides, ramps, tunnels, ropes, beams, nets, stairs, towers, bridges, etc... I would be an awesome place to hangout, play with other adults, and encourage fitness. I'll meet you there after work!
What's the most unnecessary way you've been criticised for your femininity/exposed to sexism?	I don't think that wondering what posesses people to spend 100$ on their nails every few weeks is sexist. Or why on earth you would wear neon pink claws that just make daily life more difficult. I am a woman, and I often wonder the same thing. That put aside, I once had a guy yank my bottle of beer out of my hands and order me a cocktail, cause, and I quote, "pretending to like beer makes you look like a desperate slut". Apparently, women are biologically incapable of liking beer!	for YEARS, my mom was convinced that makeup was only for stupid girls. I’ve mostly trained it out of her, but I think it’s because people criticized her a lot for not being feminine enough when she was younger. for example, her coworkers used to snipe at her, a woman with a doctorate, about wearing makeup, a skirt suit and heels to work. she’s now actually interested in learning how to wear makeup (despite being absolutely TERRIFIED of mascara), but not after years of criticizing me for liking it.
I'd like to begin practicing martial arts. Which one would you suggest?	the styles that've been shown to be most effective are: * BJJ * wrestling * muay thai * boxing * kick boxing you're likely to be wasting your money and/or learning choreography doing anything else i do bjj and have done a little muay thai, a little kick boxing, and did kali/eskrima in my teen years. but don't take my word for it. take a trained killer's opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGpDVCkhtD4 edit: wording	Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I've tried a couple of martial arts and that's the one that stuck. I have been training for 7 years now.
Can you tell us about the most inappropriate time or place you were hit on (or the most inappropriate person to have hit on you)?	I was 14 he was my neighbors 24 year old best friend. I was walking down the street with a friend and he yelled from across the street "HEY, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THAT SKIRT". I awkwardly walked faster. I saw him on and off for the next 21 years and last October I married him. So guess it works sometimes. :P Edit: word	My first SO had just died. A week later, his best friend asked if I was over him and would go on a date. What the hell, dude?
What purchase for $100 or less has impacted your life the most in the past year?	Waist Cincher, Wig, and Bra for crossdressing, tbh. I know that's not the most manliest thing to write on r/AskMen, but it's been real destressifying to turn into a girl for an hour or two every few weeks or months.	Tongue scraper. This thing is cool as hell and makes my mouth feel much fresher. You can literally see the gunk cascading off of your tongue and you get a little confidence boost knowing your breath will be better. I couldn't believe I hadn't bought one sooner.
What is the stupidest thing you've done in 2017?	Lost my virginity to my friend’s girlfriend (who is also kind of a hoe). I did it drunk and without protection and my crotch has been itchy for the past month. I didn’t even really find her attractive. Also, I got into a really stupid fender bender. Entirely my fault.	The stupidest thing I did in 2017 was getting back together with my ex. I'm not sure what I was thinking, she was really hot but certifiably insane. It ended very poorly and my heart in tatters again. And then I ended up messing up a great friendship because I was too needy and inadvertently made my friend choose between us. My friend said she didnt want to take any sides but it was clear that she sorta chose my ex over me. It was a double blow really. Thankfully I learned from all of this and I managed to not make any more major mistakes this year.
What's your worst experience after becoming emotionally invested in someone you thought felt the same way for you?	ITT: The pussyfication of men in the 21st century. Not a jab at the men here, but these stories (as I have plenty of my own) are a real bad consequence of what we have been spoonfed by Disney, feminism and cultural marxists. If you can't see it, then you are fooling yourself. Men are weak because we lack strong examples, masculinity has been demonized and termed " toxic ". These stories are all natural consequences of men trying to tame their masculinity and turning into little girls in the process. We are turning into penis having little girls and it's fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.	I told a girlfriend what I'd been through and opened up to her after a month of her pestering me to "open up." This was c. 2016 when it was 'trendy' to have guys suddenly spill open all their feelings of sunshine and rainbows. I finally let her know I'd been struggling with anxiety at my new job and how worried I was about the huge gamble we'd taken moving so far from where we'd graduated. "I think less of you for that" were the first words out of her mouth. I dumped her on the spot, and that has been difficult to get over.
Attractive men who used to be considered ugly: What were your thoughts when women started checking you out rather than look at you in disgust?	Greying hair. Actually, no, I've always been considered *somewhat* attractive - it's just that being older has become something of a magnet.	I had low self esteem, and I magnified my flaws to such an extreme that I thought myself ugly. When a girl looked at me, I thought they were looking at me in disgust. Sometimes, when they saw that they noticed them looking at me, they would giggle. I thought they were mocking at me, and they probably were many times because I was not smooth at all. The word, "dork", comes to mind. During my late teens, girls really started paying attention to me. There was one girl in particular who really made me aware how "not" ugly I was. That girl, who wasn't the mocking type, that's the person who made me realize, "hey, maybe I'm not ugly at all."
What is your opinion about beautiful women complaining about being, well, beautiful?	I know I'm getting downvoted but I seriously think beautiful women who complain about being beautiful are really annoying and should shut up. Because, I don't know, there's something wrong with the phrase "I'd like to be ugly so that men will love my personality". What, do you seriously think ugly girls or even average girls get love more easily? Even ugly/average girls can be treated merely as sex objects. And also a caring man can have problems loving someone who's not beautiful because he doesn't feel attracted at all. So, well, to answer your question... a beautiful girl who's complaining about being beautiful, either doesn't know what she's talking about or wants to stress the fact she's beautiful.	Imagine you had red hair and that's all that anyone cares about you. Your red hair is complimented all the time. People say you cannot be that smart because of your red hair. People say you only got a job because of your red hair. People hate you or like you soley because of your red hair. People view bedding you as trophy material because of your red hair. Then people talk incessantly about how your life will be ruined, be over when you inevitably lose your red hair. People fetishise you and foist unwanted sexual attention on you every time you leave your house because of your red hair. You cannot wear a hat or dye your hair and you deal with this twenty-four hours a day.
Your S.O. likes muscular men but doesn't want you to be muscular. What are your thoughts on this?	Some women find big dicks aesthetically pleasing but date guys with average or even below average dicks and it's simply that they find pleasing to look at and nothing more. She could also have zero self confidence and you were way lower on the dating totem than she liked and doesn't want you to get out of her league if you bulk up. If she starts making you feel guilty about getting fit you'll figure out pretty quick which one it is.	How would she react if it was the other way around? "No honey I like your belly-blubber, don't change. Wauw look at her, man she's fit, I just love fit women. What? No don't change honey, you don't need to be fit.." Seriously if you want to get in shape then do it, she's probably just trying not to hurt your feeling by saying you don't *need* to change. I'm pretty sure that if you get fit, she won't complain. Edit: typo
What was your most "wow that's so not like in the movies" sex moment?	Just any sexual interaction with men. Like anything that might lead into sex. Guys are terrible at flirting and always makes me feel uncomfortable instead of hot and bothered. I'm not 100000% sure on being a lesbian, which is what I think I am as of now, but sure as hell I'm a very picky bisexual when it comes to men.	Trying to have sex under the covers is not nearly as smooth as movies make it out to be. Every time I've tried, we just ended up tangled in the sheets and uncomfortable.
How do you guys feel after breaking up with someone who you knew wasn't good for you?	I honestly enjoy breakups. The being with someone part is obviously very fun and enjoyable, but it kind of hypnotizes me and turns off my thinking. I'm not really myself when I'm with someone. The part where you break up is where you get to experience the emotional turmoil of intimacy with another person without the foggy glasses and sheepish content of reciprocated infatuation. It's the part where I feel alive.	Feels like being relieved of a huge burden, that they were weighing me down physically and mentally. That's the only way I can describe it.

Men who have lived or live with a female SO, what were some unexpected things you learned about women from living with one?	Tears and promises are not something to take seriously. Egotistical bias is a thing: when she wants to go out and he doesn't, 'he's being boring'. Etc.	I have no idea how to fold the majority of my girlfriend's clothes. They're not like normal t shirts that are easily put away. They are like sequin strips of cloth with weird arms holes that are impossible to fold. Panties refuse to be folded properly and can only be scrunched and thrown in a drawer. Hair ties everywhere. She's always cold.
What's the shittiest and most unthoughtful gift you ever received from an SO?	Today for Christmas my husband gave me spice jars and silicone rings that go under your electric stove burners to prevent gunk build up.... His explanation, "they were on your Amazon wish list." Apparently I needed to explain to him that just because it is on my Amazon list doesn't mean I want it as a gift! I thought it was a little thoughtless. He tried to defend it by reminding me he bought me a fancy Kitchen Aid mixer 4 years ago for our first Christmas together. It's a good thing I love the man.	I had a boyfriend in 9th grade tell me he had a gift for me and kept talking it up. He got me a box of condoms. I hadn't had anything close to sex with him or anyone at that point
What is the dumbest item you've heard a man say they don't like women wearing?	>extremely ridiculous Cosmo article* about how wearing a black hair tie around the wrist is RUINING OUR OUTFITS, I read that article, and it wasn't that ridiculous. It was about appearing more polished, and they're right, you'll look more polished and put together if you're not wearing a hair tie around your wrist.	I read a thread on a different sub once where the complaint was about maxi dresses/skirts and how they hide half the body (i.e the legs). Ugh.
First day of nicotine patch. Smoked for four 4 years, and finally decided to quit. How did you guys handle your first few weeks?	Well youre still getting nicotine so it shouldnt be THAT hard. The real difficult part is cutting out the nicotine. I quit cigs for vaping and eventually quit vaping cold turkey. Dont get me wrong its wonderful youre quitting but really, the 'hard part' is the literal physical addiction. You will rationalize with yourself why you should get to smoke again over ane over. DONT do it. A relapse doesnt mean to you failed overall, just this one time. I quit nicotine cold turkey about 3 or 4 times before it stuck. Each time was for 2-4 months. Now Ive been 100% nicotine free for almost a year and a half with no fear of ever going back. Ps. Not being sick all the fucking time is nice too	Try and stay away from other smokers. Chewing gum helps. I also found that pretending to smoke a straw helped. Remember, the longer you hold out, the easier it gets.
Those of you with pets you let sleep in the bed, what happens with them when you have sex?	... What is sex? Oh, is that the thing I am suppose to do with the other adult that sleeps in my bed? I thought we were bedmates due to lack of empty rooms.	The dog is puritanical when it comes to sex. If we start when she's on the bed, she looks at us with great disgust and leaves of her own accord. Otherwise we'd just ignore her. She's small and easy to ignore.
My girlfriend cheated on me. What the fuck do I do now?	You know there's a redeeming quality in this. She actually called you the morning after it happened and let you know. She was crying, so there was some semblance of guilt there. We all make mistakes and I don't think she set out to cheat on her bf of 1.5 years when she woke up. If she didn't want to be with you at all, she had a year and a half to end it. All this to say, we're all shitty sometimes and people make mistakes. At least she had the decency to tell you upfront.	Settle into a new single guy routine until you're ready for another relationship. Take this relationship and its demise as a life lesson, but don't carry trust issues into a new relationship and make a new woman pay for your exes mistake.
What tv/movie relationships did you once adore, but now look back and it's totally toxic?	How about Totoro and those two children? He only interacts with them when no adults are present. In secret. He also takes them for rides without their parent's consent or knowledge. What a creep.	My Best Friend's Wedding didn't age well for most 2019 sensibilities. Cameron Diaz is a college junior who is dropping out to marry a 28 year old? Are we supposed to want a "cat fight" over this mediocre man?
What are the signs you look for in your own life to indicate that you're ready for a new relationship?	I'd say a big sign would be an general non-interest in getting in another relationship. That is to say, you're not actively looking for one, don't necessarily want to, and are happy being on your own.	* when you can enter a new relationship without prior experience poisoning you (I.e.: you're not ready if you go into it being paranoid about cheating because your ex cheated). * When you are sufficiently confident in yourself that you're ready to ask yourself if you like her as opposed to only worrying about her liking you. * When you aren't hoping a relationship is going to fix all your problems and resolve unhappiness you really should be working on.
Do you ever have moments when you look at your SO and think….DAMN I love this person?	Regularly. One time I was super high, and kept going on and on about how cute her teeth and knee caps are...? I don't even know.	ugh. yes. all the time. Even just sitting here at work, i'll start thinking about him and be blown away. It usually happens too when he hasn't noticed I'm in the room or if he's just standing there telling me a story. I love to see his face light up. It's my favorite.
A guy kissed me last night. Should I tell my SO? Would you like to know?	This shit drives me nuts. How could you NOT have gotten away from the guy? If OP was unable to leave the situation that constitutes sexual assault. If you were sexually assaulted there should be consequences for the prepatrator. More likely OP willingly cheated on her SO and is now trying to bypass the guilt by skewing the recollection of events Downvote me to hell but this victimization scenario you've built sounds like a crock of shit.	Just tell him immediately, especially if honesty is important to you guys. If it happened to my SO I'd much rather hear it from her and have her explain than from someone else that saw it.
Guys here who're average in dick size: Have you ever been complimented on your penis?	Not about my cock but about my technique. Friend of a FWB told me "She says you really know what you're doing."	I usually get told it's a good size. Which is a nice way of say it's small. Doesn't bother me though because I have a decent sized hand for fisting.
Ladies, what is one thing about your partner you don't like, but deal with because you love them despite that?	He cannot plan to save his life, it drives me absolutely insane because I plan everything out: literally. I schedule meals, down to the minute that I should start cooking or prepping the food. So when he decides to do something spontaneous, it always catches me off guard and can mess up my entire day depending on when he tells me. I love that he can go with the flow and be so relaxed about everything, but boy can he throw me off sometimes.	He's not a morning person, and I definitely am. It is really annoying sometimes to not be able to plan stuff with him on the weekends till (what I consider) lunchtime. It's heightened because I'm not just an early bird, I'm one of those happy, bouncy morning people that wakes up early at 100% energy. It is usually okay, but things like finding flights or going to movies (I cannot start a film at 9PM, I'll fall asleep halfway through!) can be a bit disjointed

We're encouraged to marry "before all the good ones are gone". In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going?	Lmao at 30+ women who doesn't want to realize their prime is already gone, and most good men are taken.	>In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going? Interestingly, "the good ones" didn't even show up until my mid-late twenties.
Growing up my parents raised me to believe that just because a guy will have sex with me, doesn't mean he likes or respects me. Do you think that's outdated, or still a good thing for women to bear in mind when dating?	Yes, it's pretty outdated. But more than that: What I don't like about statements made like this is that it places a large emphasis on the guy's view of a woman, instead of her view of herself. Tell her that if she has sex with a guy and that's all he wants, she might feel used afterward. Let her know what the result is for her, not for him.	> Growing up my parents raised me to believe that just because a guy will have sex with me, doesn't mean he likes or respects me. This is sometimes true. I've met a bunch of men who will sleep with women and not respect them in the least. As in, banging them bitches yo! Hoes. However, I've also known a bunch of men who will only sleep with women whom they both like and respect. This is one of those things where you have to go on a case-by-case basis, but what you're concerned with does definitely happen.
What's a compliment that you rarely receive but, when you do, it means a lot to you?	I don't like compliments. I know what I do well, I don't need anyone else's opinion. Constructive criticism or shut up.	It's such a bro thing but if someone mentions that they can tell I've been working out or a friend will say "You're looking big, dude" or something. That feels nice. Also when people compliment things that I've done or built. Like I redid my landscaping in front of my house shortly after moving in. My dad comments on it every time he comes over with "you've made this all look so much better" Feels good.
What’s one reason you personally might go soft during sex/not have interest in the moment?	Condoms. Go soft every time I put them on. Edit: you guys are weird. Why are you downvoting my comment. It’s just my experience.	Leg cramp. It's hard to to stay hard when you are freaking out trying to get off the bed all while trying to stretch it out. It's happened before and I guarantee that it'll happen again.
How much watermelon is an appropriate amount to eat in 36 hours?	You should eat something else. Too much of anything isn't good. Although watermelon is "healthy" and contains a lot of water it still has a lot of sugar. It's all about balancing your diet. I'd go with another snack.	As much as you physically can. When it starts to make you gag, have one more bite and wait an hour. Then repeat.
(Serious) Women of Reddit with very few/no friends, How are things? How do you cope with loneliness (if you experience it) And, if you don't mind answering, Is there any reason you find yourself in such a position?	I generally prefer being alone so it doesn't really bother me. I go to the gym 4x per week so I see people there and one of the days is a group class that I interact there. On weekends I see my boyfriend and we chat during the week too. I'll usually see one or my friends once a week or so. I also go to AA meetings and I have acquaintances there. All that plus being around people at work is enough for me. I just want to be alone after a day of work + gym. Haha.	I live with my homebody best friend and two cats. I'm never lonely. I don't have many friends for a few reasons, I guess. I'm an introvert and don't particularly like socializing with strangers, which translate to not meeting a lot of people. And I prefer close friendships which not everyone is open to and which takes a certain level of "chemistry" to build, so my options are limited as is my time (since I'm spending it being close to the friends I do have). Group hangouts can be fun on occasion, but I find them exhausting by the end of it, so I wouldn't wanna do it often, so I'm not exactly in need of a lot of friends.
I 19[f] want to wait until marriage. Will any guy ever want to date me?	> being a virgin until marriage is a horrible idea that just sets everyone up for failure because the couple does not understand their sexual compatibility (I can understand this but I don't know if its always true). It *is* always true. How can you understand your sexual compatibility if (a) you have never had sex, and therefore don't know what you like, and (b) you have never had sex with your partner, so you don't know if he meets your needs? Plus for a relationship as serious as marriage, he should not only meet your needs but should be the perfect fit for them. Personally I would never date someone with your beliefs, but I'm sure you can find some guys who would.	You've made a choice that will limit your dating pool. Look for guys with a similar value set. They're out there. But don't waste your time with guys who want premarital sex, mmmkay?
Married men of AskMen, what do you do to be a good husband?	I stopped being the doormat earning all the income, doing the majority of the housework, and catering to her every need. I stood up to her, and manipulated her into seeing a therapist which she desperately needed.	I keep my shit together when things go wrong. I handle the hard stuff. I be the unwavering rock in the face of adversity that she wants. I take care of the house. I'm a good father to our son. I keep "dating" her, despite being married for 11 years. I work hard to make things better for our family. I fuck her right, fuck her often, and I make sure to throw in some spontaneity. I hit the gym, keep in shape, and maintain my appearance to make sure I *stay* fuckable. I let her know as often as possible that she's one of the best things that ever happened to me.
What's the weirdest way you've heard yourself described?	My friend: You're a good person and always willing to help but can you not be a troll everyday? Sounds about right...	My friend told her other friend that I was "The Leslie Knope of Gift-Giving" which was pretty awesome to hear.
What do you find to be the most visible sign of casual misogyny?	Everyone. Please stop invalidating commenters responses in this thread. People are sharing their experiences with casual misogyny and trying to start pedantic arguments over the definition of misogyny is derailing and invalidating.	Everyone.

What is the most offensive thing you've ever said?	I would call your remark "black humor" or "gallows humor". The disturbing thing is quite a number of people in Asia actually believe this about animals, and do in fact torture them before consuming them.	The one I feel the worst about was probably because it wasn't intended unlike most of the offensive comments I make. I was in the middle of a high school class, and one of the dorkier girls (you know the ones big coke bottle glasses, always reminding the teacher about homework, but not actually that smart) was wearing a t-shirt supporting ice hockey. Trying to be nice since everyone else gave her a hard time, I tapped her on the shoulder and said "do you play or just watch?" I realized I fucked up when I saw the look on her face and my buddies started laughing. She storms off in a huff and I dumbfoundedly try to figure out where I fucked up when I see it was a shirt supporting special olympics hockey. 15 years later I still feel bad about it.
What are you tired of hearing about, as a man, about men?	Rampant Feminazism and her thoughts on men and how MOST if not ALL just want sex. NOPE I might ask the counter question? What if we jus wanted food, water and company of a friendly ladyperson to chat with? I am also the part of the menkind that likes old music of many varieties and expects nothing major in return apart from a peck on the cheek and kind smile if going on a date of sorts?	My favorite and im sure women hear it too. When you stop looking for the right girl, is when you'll find her. Shut up Grandma, I don't want to date my second cousin...
How is your start to the week?	My SO is sick. These past couple weeks had been crazy and expensive, and we're also moving next week. I started feeling a tingle in my throat and gargled salt water and it's not feeling too bad today? Hopefully it goes away.	My life is pointless and the start of my week has been no different. This morning I woke up a half hour before my alarm went off and my dog noticed. I guess he was cold because he crawled on me and fell asleep on my stomach/chest and then we slept like that the last half hour. So I guess something good happened.
Have you ever slept with a man who you knew was taken?	No, and I would never. Knowingly helping someone cheat is despicable, and they're as much to blame as the cheater themselves.	I have. It was a drunken hookup, and he was in an LDR with no end date. Neither of those things makes it okay, but those were the reasons I used to rationalize it at the time. I feel bad, but they're still together, so I guess they worked it out. On a broader level, I believe that both parties should claim responsibility for their actions, but the person with the SO has broken the trust in their relationship, whereas the other man/woman doesn't have that kind of obligation beyond the implications for their own moral compass.
Does it occur to you that many men seem to be terrified of living ordinary, average but comfortable lives? If so, why do you think that is?	I am not terrified of an ordinary, average life.... I am terrified of how quickly it can be taken away from me. &#x200B; Wife Divorces me Co-worker makes an accusation falsely accused &#x200B; Being male in today's world of "you are guilty until proven innocent" if you are male. &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B;	For me, at least, I think it’s kinda comforting having a normal life. This is also coming from someone who truly loves the people around him. I think that’s what makes it worth it? Like yeah, I wake up and sit at a desk like everybody else, but I have a normal functioning body, a good place to live, a great family and girlfriend. Shit man I like this. Now if I had an overly stressful job, or depression, or a bad family then yeah. I can see how that would suck. But I never found something in my life that made me want to throw it all away and chase that one thing. I’m comfortable and love the people around me, and idk I think that’s a life worth living
Redditors who just ended a long term relationship, and redditors who just got into one after a long period of singleness, what was the most striking change for you?	My boyfriend of 6 months (not long term at all, but it was still significant) and I broke up almost 3 months ago. I think the hardest part was not hearing his voice anymore. Like clockwork, everyday when he'd get out of work he'd call me. We'd talk about our day while he was walking home from work, and those 20 minutes became the highlight of my day. Even if we didn't talk about anything in particular, it was nice having that little routine. I also recently got into the genre of music he loved, and it's hard not being about to text him about a cool song I heard.	Ended a 8 year relationship half a year ago. The thing that hit me the hardest is the lack of that someone you'd talk to and just hang around with when you get home after work. Coming home to an empty home after so much time together is really... odd. Still not used to it.
What are some great bachelor party ideas that do not include strip clubs or gambling?	All the bachelor parties that I've been to that didn't involve strippers, drugs, gambling or all the above were hella lame.	The vast majority of the bachelor parties I've enjoyed that weren't the two you mentioned were the boys all just getting a cabin somewhere, being in nature chopping wood and making a bonfire and grilling meat and enjoying the seclusion from the outside world
Men, what things do you do to "treat" yourself?	My version of treating myself is the time that I get to spend at the hunt camp each fall/winter. No wife, no kids, no world. Just me, usually a couple buddies, and the outdoors... and a LOT to drink.	Treated myself yesterday. One hundred percent me day. Slept in, watched Netflix in bed for a bit while playing Starbound. Got up, played some Killing Floor 2 with friends. Went out to the bar that serves some great food for dinner, enjoyed it. Left the bar, went to a movie. Came home, showered, crashed into bed with the doggos.
Have you ever had a friend you liked but hate who she is in social media?	I had a friend that I enjoyed working with, and we eventually became Facebook friends. Completely different. Super poor grammar, in the form of "ebonics" and textspeak. And her attitude was a little worse online as well. The kind of ghetto/ratchet personalities I tend to avoid. I put up with it, but I'm not all too happy seeing her posts.	>She even felt I was distancing myself (cause I didn't like her insta picture, and she noticed) and even sent me flowers. If not liking someone's instagram pictures occasionally is distancing yourself from them...I've distanced myself from my mom and like all of my friends. What on earth? Why is she keeping track? Also, sending flowers because you didn't like her picture is a *super* guilt-trip-y way for her to react.
Why do so many men answer questions on AskWomen?	most of the questions have to do with dating advice, and when it comes to questions about becoming more confident and attractive as a man, men generally have the best answers. it makes perfect sense if you think about it. women haven't been on the journey of becoming an attractive man, but other men sure have made that journey. also, reddit is chock full of dudes with nothing better to do at work.	It doesn't bother me if it's actually the best advice that was given in the thread and it was given without any condescension towards the women that have posted. Sometimes that happens and that's fine, because though the official purpose of this sub is to be a window into the female mind, it's really become an advice-giving thing and the priority should be good advice. It bothers me when you get the feeling that people are upvoting a male comment because it contradicts the majority of advice given by female commenters. Sort of like sending the message, "we didn't like your opinions on this matter, ladies, so we're gonna stick with *this guy*." That happens sometimes but I think it's a bit less frequent than the first scenario.
Would you go to a Viking themed steakhouse, why or why not?	Not really. Everyone I've ever met off the internet who was really into viking culture was at best a white nationalist or at worst a white supremacist. I bet it would end up being a hang out for them at the very least.	The longhouse is the better name. Maybe add a few typical nordic dishes, check if open fires are allowed in restaurants before designing the inside, theres businesses that offer axe throwing, think in that direction instead of ruining your steak axes. Good luck.
Men who served in a military, what did you do for a living after leaving the army?	Got out 06, applied and was selected as a mercenary for a famous company, got paid $150,000 plus $100,000 for hazard pay. Mainly guard duty along with some assassinations. Free lanced for the local warlord, made about an extra $500,000, but a massacre at a village left a bitter taste in my mouth, warlord not happy, went back to merc, killed a bunch more people, made about $10 million, now retired, living the life.	Air Force sent me to cooking school. 17 year old me wasn't to happy about it at the time thought I was going to be an air traffic controller or computer specialist...(lol) After I got out I went to work as a chef in a large hospital and increased my skills. Stuck with it because hospitals have great pay and benefits but soon realized I had a passion for cooking. That was 20 years ago. Today I am the director of that kitchen I oversee 150 employees and we have an excellent reputation for the food we serve.
What is a LPT/Lifehack that is something small that has made a big difference you that you would like to share?	If you're too sick to take care of yourself on your period please use a pad. I'd rather change your pad than tampon. Also please have pads, it feels really wrong for me to insert something in my wife's vag while she isn't awake.	I do 10 of some sort of exercise every time I stand up at home. Usually squats or burpees, without really even trying I can do a few hundred a day and I've definitely noticed a difference in my body.
What was a girl's worst reaction to you trying to kiss her?	Well she screamed "who the fuck are you? How did you get to my gouse" and started trying to untie ber arms.	I leant in to kiss a girl and she poked me in the eye. It was devastating. I had to go to the eye hospital.
What crazy things have your mother said to you?	Wrong gender, but in 2012 my father told me that I "ruined my mothers birthday" for having multiple panic attacks because of guilt (I did something bad but was hiding it) that evening and locking myself in the laundry room for a while while my Mom freaked out about me. He has since then fully apologized, but its still something I'm never going to let go. Its not even that bad, what he told me. But it still, well, stays.	* Lock your bedroom door at night. Men can't control themselves. * Having sex changes a woman because something goes inside her. It's not the same for a man because nothing goes inside them. * On their wedding night, if the man finds out his bride isn't a virgin, he won't want her anymore. They'll get divorced and she'll never find anyone else to marry her. * Don't marry a Japanese man * or a Mexican man or a black man or a Korean man. * The man shows his love by buying her presents and paying for dates. The woman shows her love by accepting his marriage proposal.
What is the most cringe worthy trend right now?	Hipsters blatantly stealing from back culture, capitalizing off of it, and then getting mad and writing think pieces about "creative expression" When they get called out.	This might not be a thing in every country, but it became a trend among Turkish online stores as well as some bloggers to conduct a drawing for a prize on Instagram. They post the picture of whatever the prize is, you need to follow their account, repost the picture on your own profile with a hashtag to enter. My Instagram home page is becoming a product catalog in between animal pictures.
What is something you wish men did more of during sex?	This thread has been locked due to very clear brigading from an unknown source. Enough answers have been given to answer OPs question.

Is anyone else sick-to-death of getting relationship zoned?	This happens all the time! One time I started climbing with this guy a lot and one day after climbing, he tried to kiss me by my car. When I told him I wasn't interested and just wanted to be friends, he told me that he "had enough friends". It was just so rude. Like, if you like me for more than just the possibility of my vagina, why wouldn't you wanna be friends?	This is how college went for me, basically. I got so tired of it. I would straight up start telling dudes I wasn't interested in a relationship at all and it _still happened_. I get it, they want relationships/casual sex/what have you. That's fine, but I didn't want that and I tried to be clear! [Also I find this to be a funny take on the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I66aySW4le8)
You buy a woman a drink at the bar, she's not interested in you. How can she politely express this?	When he buys the first one, say something along the lines of "I'll get the next one." or "Thanks, but let me get the next one." If he ignores this and buys the next round anyway, it's not on you.	Don't take it. Generally I don't like this practice. Half the girls I know do it intentionally in the hopes of getting free drinks, and guys are petulant about the practice when it goes the way you describe. Just don't be a part of it unless you want to maybe make a new friend.
Adults of r/askwomen: how did you decide which town/city to settle in?	This question seems adorably naive. It's like no one her is below upper middle class or something. Most people decided where to live based on where they already lived and where they could get a job. Or where they married someone that already lives somewhere. Most people don't decide to live much of anywhere, where they were born dictates it.	I'm opting for a house in the country rather than the city. I require peace, quiet, hiking, and gardening. 💮
Fucked up and told my kinda bf & co. that his dick is "perfectly average." What do I do?	Is it average? If so, you didn't fuck up, it was the truth. He knows his dick is average and shouldn't be sensitive about it.	Own up to it. Call him, say something like, "I'm a doofus. I totally did not mean to say that, it sounded better in my head. What can I do to make it up to you?"
What male stereotype do you hate or not understand?	Thanks. The easiest way to educate oneself about a matter is to piss off someone passionate and well informed. I don't know enough about Milo as it seems. Some of the scandals you referred to are new to me. I haven't yet formed a solid opinion of the guy. The history you brought up was quite interesting. However, I do think there are examples in present day of radical groups attacking and objectifying others all around us. The was a university, for example, that changed their women's studies major to womyn's studies because they found something wrong with "men" being in the title. That is extreme and unnecessary and dozens of such examples exists. I'd name a few more but I don't have the time to do hours of research to refresh my mind. Thank you for your input. May a civilized discussion continue.	I caaaaaaaaan't stand the stereotype that men are incapable adults, especially when it comes to parenting. Ads selling cleaning or baby items are the worst for it & it makes me irrationally angry.
What's the biggest bachelor/bachelorette party or wedding night fuck up you have seen?	Bachelor parties are honestly retarded and I hope the toxic tradition dies out. It's either awkward or it's like the scenario you described which is worse. Edit: My bad, to clarify, I meant strip club bachelor parties.	My old boss cheated on his bachelor party night, swore all his friends to secrecy, went through with the wedding then told her on the first night of their honeymoon out of guilt. Married and split up within 1 week!
How can I stop feeling like a loser because I'm a virgin even though I'm happy in all other areas of my life?	most comments here are actually bullshit. You do not feel like a loser for not having sex because society tells you. SEX IS A NORMAL NEED AND NOT HAVING IT IS BAD FOR YOU. It is good to try to have sex.Unfortunately if you did not have sex until now it usually is because you are not good looking. In recent years women only go for very good looking men especially when they are young and they do not give a change to men who are average. there has been a big change in the behavior of women in the last 30-40 years and it is in the detriment of the average and bottom looking men.	I'm going to disagree with everyone here who says "don't worry about it" or "it's not a big deal". If you want to have sex but aren't having it, you have to actively work toward making it happen (without letting your grades drop, of course - grades and sex are mutually compatible, and I shouldn't have to say it, but there are people who will argue against this). When you made out with those girls, did you want to and try to have sex with them?
Did anyone else go see Guardians of the Galaxy? Thoughts?	So wasn't into it. There was a manchild-womaniser-emotionally-arrested-at-7 quality to our hero that I don't find annoying when Chris Pratt is playing Andy Dwyer (minus the womanising) but really don't need more of in heroes.	I absolutely loved it. Seen it twice already and will probably go back a few more times. The soundtrack fits so well. Chris Pratt makes an amazing Starlord. I didn't expect to be that emotional over a tree. It's a roller coaster of emotions - hilarious one second and sob fest the next.

Your SO gets a full printout of your porn viewing history. Do you have any chance of not being single by the end of the day? Why or why not?	The better question is does she have any chance of not being single by the end of the day. Why she care about my porn history. I can’t stand women that get caught up on the past or women that act like porn is a form of cheating.	A printout? I suspect for many guys (in the perfect age window of having hit puberty while internet porn was so available and having lived that way for years and years into adulthood), they'd be single if only because their significant other is now fatally buried under all the paper it took to print out their entire history of porn consumpton.
How do you get over a breakup that hasn't happened yet?	I tried feverishly to fix every problem before things hit critical mass all while in absolute denial of what was coming around the corner. On some level I knew it was coming though, and while I'm not proud of it started planting the seeds for something potential in the future with a couple girls in my classes/greater social circle (especially this one girl who was in one of my film classes... we started sitting next to each other during screenings and getting dinner together after). Truth is, though, I didn't get over it, until my ex finally did what had to be done, didn't let me plead and beg, and ended it like she was removing a band-aid. It took actually having an defined end for me to be able to start moving on.	Sorry man, this stuff hurts whether you're 17 or 37. But unfortunately a lot of people use "breaks" because they're too chicken to have the talk and give a reason and be compassionate. I hate to say it but things are already over. She was fucking ice cold and heartless to handle things the way she did but I guess the truth is she's 17 too. So I guess to get around your question... It *is* over. Accept it and move on. If she comes crawling back, you can think about it then. But she won't have an honest conversation with you about it and she's tweeting about how happy she is? Fuck that noise.
Women who always/most of the time go braless, how did it affect your boobs? Positives/negatives?	My boobs are very perky and their shape is pretty great. Bras aren’t good for the ligaments, so I’ve read. (I’m a trans dude, but yeah.)	I've been braless for several years now except with some outfits/situations. I have tiny tits so the only difference it makes for me is comfort.
People who moved to a different country, what's something that still gives you a bit of culture shock?	I moved to the U.S. 20 years ago (from Puerto Rico) and I still find it odd that there is no set culture here. It's definitely a melting pot, and a fairly new nation. (This is only odd because PR has such a defined culture, and it's ingrained in every day life.) (Edit: Not saying it has *no* culture, saying it has *many* cultures, which PR doesn't have in the grand scale that the U.S. does. That's what gave me the "cultural shock", because it was so different.)	France: I've been here for over 10 years and I still get surprised when I see people walking home from the bakery munching on their (dry!) baguette. Not quite as bizarre, but semi-strangers (as in, you've seen them around but neither of you know the others name) doing the whole cheek-kissing thing. However, I'd now find it really weird to move back to the UK and not say hello/good morning when walking into a shop.
What about you makes you a catch to date?	I'm one of the few people who are actually pretty unique in my life experiences. I have lived extensively in Africa, Europe, America - and not studying abroad or anything, that obviously does not count. Grew up during a civil war. I speak three languages. I played soccer semi professionally and was a touring musician for a couple years. I'm good looking, full head of hair, am told I look very very similar to Zayn Malik (my friends disabled younger sister is still convinced im him haha). Work in the medical field. Am 25 years old and as long as shes hot I am very down to eat ass	Late 30's, no children, professional career who lives alone and is in decent shape. I feel like the white stag.
What's the worst way that a workplace fucked you over?	Boss verbally gave me a raise. She said it would appear starting on my next paycheck. I didn't have it in writing and she didn't give it to me until my next one after that. I did the math, and saw she shorted me approximately $80. Now I make sure everything is in writing.	My boss was gone for the first month of my new job. She made up a 12 page list of protocols for me to learn and follow on my own. The 12 pages still wasn't enough detail for all of her rules. She was passive aggressive, she talked poorly about me to other employees, she made a habit of switching my day off so that she could have weekends off, actually I wouldn't know when my day off was until the day before when she told me. I worked there for 7 miserable months. The day I quit she started throwing insults at me and why I was a terrible employee. She is on the top of my shit list.
Ladies of Reddit, how did you know that your SO was it for you?	My daughter from a previous realtionship was at a sleep over and we had a kid free night. We had some friends over for dinner and drinks. I drank too much wine and got sick and sloppy drunk. I ended up throwing up in the shower. It was bad. He cleaned everything up and took care of my stupid ass. Husband material right there.	I'm an introvert. I need time alone to recharge or I break down. He doesn't drain me, I find him completely restful to be around, I could spend all day every day with him and not need a break, we just click.
What changes have you intentionally made to your personality, and why?	My mother and I don't get along. In my teen years I started to notice how her and some people in general seem to gravitate towards drama and negativity. It just seemed like a lot of useless information to keep track of, who hates who because she/he said this.. I always thought how nice it'd be if the only thing I've had to worry about was whether or not I have enough TP or something. As a young adult I realized I simply didn't care about who hates who. I don't care what happened on tv. I just want peace. I chose peace. Mother eventually gave up trying to include me in family drama because I kept neutral about everything. This was also around the time I began studying Buddhism and that was more fulfilling than watching Rikki Lake.	I realized that my coworkers were ignoring me intentionally, and a long talk with my boss made me realize how stubborn and hard-headed I am. I started being more open to other people's opinions, being more complacent and complaining less, and now I feel much more like a part of the group.
Women 40+: What is the best thing about getting older?	Well, I'm 52 now, so I'd say boning younger men, especially twenty somethings (their skin is so soft and their muscles just sooooo hard) lolz. Realizing that the old chestnut "if they ain't feeding you, fucking you or financing you, don't you pay them any mind" is TRUE.	I'm in my mid-40's and the best thing about getting older is that I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I ever have been. I wish I'd felt the same way when I was younger, but I was very insecure and had low self esteem. Now I recognize my qualities and realize my self-worth. Also, I have a heck of a lot more money than I had previously and that's definitely a plus.
Men who married women with "promiscuous" past, how is/was your marriage?	It's going to vary wildly, for obvious reasons, but the statement that "women who were promiscuous aren't fit for marriage/LTR" is patently untrue.	I've had two relationships (was married to one) with promiscuous women who had much higher partner counts. They both cheated on me eventually but the attitudes they shared afterwards is what kind of honestly steered me away from dating promiscuous partners again. The its just sex it isn't a big deal and the what about me attitudes of them both (and experiences I've seen friends deal with also) kind of messed with me. I've been with women who had high libidos and partner counts higher then mine with no troubles, just the women I've been with who had far more casual approaches to sex haven't been compatible with me. For reference I've had 11 partners my ex wife had something around 60 the other higher.
Any men put on a lot of muscle and realize a huge difference in how people treat you?	Yes, women are very shallow. Same experience here. A guy will talk to nearly any woman who decides to speak to him. A woman cries creep and tries to GTFO out of a conversation if she's not instantly attracted to the guy.	I'm not big by any means (yet), but I used to look like I escaped from Auschwitz. Look in my post history if you're curious. I've noticed more looks from girls since they don't outweigh me. Also get a lot less shit from friends since they don't all out-muscle me anymore.
For you married guys out there, did you, and when did you, stop fantasizing about your wife? Has sex changed for you?	I've always had fantasies about other women, even in the early dating years. Been married 10 years, 2 kids and wife still looks really good, have sex probably twice a week (would be more if work schedules permitted) ... I still want to fuck my wife, but I'd also like to mess around with some of the hot neighbor wives, the cute nurses at work, the hot moms at my kids events. Maybe I just lack the morals like some of you, but my dick is hard to satisfy.	So I have been with the same woman since 1972, I was in emotional love and physical lust when we got together and we basically stayed there till we got pregnant. Our sex life came back as having the baby became routine, same for baby two and three. As we got older we had dry spells sexually. We would switch to emotional love making, a lot of talking and cuddling and taking time for diner just us. Sex would come back and we would go back that direction for a while. My wife eventually had a medical issue and went through the change, things went back and forth again. I had my hips replaced and things swung again. If you just learn early to love unconditionally minor bumps like this mean nothing.
What's a little thing that your woman does that sends you over the edge during sex?	Usually when she cums she will start bucking her hips and wagging her tail. That with her vaginal contraction milking me for all its worth.	Her mouth, lips, and tongue- wanders around playfully when she's using them on me. It slays me. Her enthusiasm is terrible for my stamina but it makes my brain absolutely melt. Lastly, when she talks filthy and doesn't feel embarrassed or uncomfortable- super hot. When she wants me harder, deeper, or faster and vocalizes it- I'm usually a goner.
Hey reddit, I'm going through something called a "quarter-life crisis". I don't want to waste anymore time crying or feeling horrible, and I want to change. For those who've reinvented themselves in their mid 20's, what advice would you give to someone feeling overwhelmed?	Eat well sleep well exercise. Focus on that first. The rest will follow if you can get those basics right.	I'll tell you what worked for me - * More of: hobbies, exercise, experiences with people and places outside my comfort zone, dates with women who didn't check all of my boxes but were a little fun for a night or two, liking myself for myself. * and less of: material possessions (and the bills that come with them), hanging people who contribute nothing to my life out of habit, trying to be someone I'm not, comparing my progress in life to that of other people, watching television.
I'm afraid I'll never own a home and never have money for retirement. Any other ladies in the same boat?	I'd like to highly recommend the book *I Will Teach You To Be Rich.* It's full of practical advice with specific steps to take. It's easy to get overwhelmed with finances. But you can do it, OP! Do it for your future self.	I feel the exact same way. I feel like I'm a good 5 years behind everyone else my age. I know that not all people in their mid 20's are doing well, but I never meet anyone who is doing worse than me :(. I've never even had a full-time job (I've applied to thousands of jobs and still only manage to get the low paying part-time jobs) so I'm not able to save up. I'm currently working part-time and I'm barely making any money. I really don't think my life is going to improve. Why is it so difficult for me to get a decent paying job with benefits?
Today is International Women’s Day, we’ve got a long way to go, but in your lifetime what are the changes you’ve seen that have made life better for women?	In my lifetime, I think things have only gotten worse. Before I was born, some strides were made. I think feminism made improvements in the 1970s, but things have gone back downhill since then.	It sounds fickle, but I really appreciate having more women creators influencing pop culture. Especially for things like comedy. I LOVE that there are female comics out there making jokes that I can relate to now. It seems like such a small thing - but characters like Liz Lemon? Absolutely priceless. I’ve also really noticed it in music. When I was a teenager I liked rock, and it felt like the only “credible” rock stars were men. It’s just so amazing seeing female artists (eg. Camp cope, Courtney Barnett) with guitars being badasses and singing songs I can relate to.
Employed Women of Reddit: On an average day how much time do you think/complain/talk about work outside of work?	I do like a 20 minute recap with my spouse. Other than that, I try hard not to bring it home.	When I started my job, a lot. Then I realized that complaining about it didn’t make me feel any better. So now on average I’d say less than 5 minutes a day. (Although if my coworkers and I go out socially that will be the bulk of our conversations.)
Ladies, what is the creepiest way someone has tried to get your attention?	I'm a 30 year old construction worker that's 6'1" and 220lbs. Every story I read on here of some poor girl makes me wish I was there to beat the shit out of the creep harassing them. Girls, on behalf of all men, I'm so sorry	I was like 14 at the time and out with a friend. It was a snow day and we were making snow men. This guy rolled up in his car, he was like at least 30+ years old and asked if we'd like to 'see his carrot'. :/ We didn't say anything and he wouldn't leave, and then he got out of the car. My friend and I ran down the road and around the corner to hide in her house. We saw him get in his car, drive around the corner and shouted for us something like "Hey pretty girls, where are you?" We stayed hidden and saw him get frustrated, at which point he kicked over all the snowmen all our neighbours had made.
At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission?	>At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission? Never. >When is it, or is it ever, acceptable to simply assume sexual permission in a relationship? Never.	I feel that there is never all-encompassing implicit sexual permission, but at some point you should know what your partner likes and dislikes and should have a general idea on their limits. Since it is impossible to go over every scenario ever, you should be able to make generally accurate judgement calls on these things from the likes/dislikes/limits you have explicitly discussed. Personally, I don't think it's odd for a partner to maybe touch a butt or play with breasts while the other is asleep and so if I had an issue with it I would likely bring that up before it happens. If I didn't have the foresight for that, I would not be upset if I had to swat a hand away groggily, especially since I know my partner would listen and he would never intentionally do something I am uncomfortable with.
Older women: what is something that a lot of younger women on r/askwomen don't seem to understand?	This thread, and some of the responses, are ageist. Different people have different experiences, which defines who we are. And the perspective of a young person is no less valid than the experience of an older person. So to say that young people are immature, "don't have life figured out", or "will look back and cringe" is disrespectful and invalidating. I like the idea of this thread, but if think a better thread would be giving all women a chance to give the other women on here some general advice, regardless of age. But to ask "what don't younger women understand?" seems very ageist.	Patience really is a virtue. 22 year old me was never able to sit and wait for the outcome. I had to confront it! Deal with it! Fix it! Right Now! It's amazing how many things fix themselves. It's even more amazing simply acknowledging that maybe it simply isn't any of my business.
Women of r/AskMen: Why do you like hanging out here and what is you favorite thing about this forum?	It's the substantially but still only relatively less uptight version of askwomen. You get a few who think abd act like cavemen here but still beats mods putting words in your mouth.	> Why do you like hanging out here? I value learning about male perspectives on things. >What is your favorite thing about this forum? Men.
I need a new hobby. Why is yours awesome?	Swing dance. It's lots of fun and a great creative outlet, plus it's inherently social, and the community is great, very diverse and welcoming. Great way to meet people and learn something that you can spend years and years improving and refining and experimenting with.	Weightlifting - I look and feel awesome, and it's taught me wonderful things about myself, my limits, and how to discipline my mind. Overwatch - Have you *played* this shit? It's amazing.
Women who have had plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons, what did you get done and why? How did it impact your life after? Do you regret anything?	When I was about 10, I had my ears surgically pinned back. It was my mother's decision, I didn't really have a say, but she hated how they stuck out (she later had my youngest sister have the procedure as well). It hasn't really impacted my life at all, and I think it's because I was so young, and too young to even have a complex about my ears. But I often wonder if I had never had the procedure when I did if I would have grown to be insecure about my ears later.	I got 8 moles removed about 2 months ago (I am a super moley person). I chose ones that either stuck out loads or were weird looking or a combo of both. Even though one turned into a keloid scar I'm happy I got it done, the one on my forehead was nicknamed 'mount Everest' by an imaginative boy at school. And I love to run my fingers over where they used to be and just feel flat skin, except the keloid scar but I'm using bio oil and it's still smaller than it was.
Do you believe feminism has a place in modern society? Are you a feminist? Why or why not?	Jesus fuck. How often do we have to have this topic? I don't identify as feminist, and I'm relatively critical of the modern movement, and even I'm sick of seeing this come up all the damn time. Yes, it has a place in modern society. I have some disagreements about how they're going about things lately, but over all there's still a lot to be done.	Yes, feminism is much needed in today's society, especially in my culture. The majority of men in my country have only just learnt about the concept of feminism, and a distressing number of them are immediately associating it with man-bashing. They do not bother to actually educate themselves on the history and significance of feminism, yet they are quick to blurt out insults and threats on feminist women, safely hidden behind the anonymity of the internet. And yes, I am a feminist, because I believe people of all sexes and genders must have equal rights. I am also pro-LGBTQ for similar reasons.
Guys that have had a relationship off of Tinder what helped your bio according to her?	My bio was a Dostoyevsky quote and "be interesting". I'm not nor was desperate to get laid, I was going for quality over quantity. I am in a college town, filled with shallow flakey Jersey girls with a million orbiters, no bio, filter pics and only an Instagram link. I was not at all interested in that, been there done that kind thing. Your pic game needs to show you doing interesting stuff. A dog helps. And more than everything else, it has to be genuinely *you*. That's what attracts people. Bold, open, you being you.	Tinder is pics or nothing. Unless you are a comedic genius, then you'll be all "Wow what a great bio I made" then you post it to reddit and now everyone steals your bio.
What are your thoughts on seeing your engagement ring before the proposal? Would it ruin the moment when it actually happened in any way?	I’m picky, especially about jewelry, so I’d probably mention styles I like vs. styles I don’t like, and then want to be surprised. And maybe suggest people to help him 😂	My husband and I picked out the ring together. When he proposed two months later, I didn’t even see the ring; I was just so excited that he was asking! I don’t think I really looked at it until someone else asked to see it.
Ladies who like to hang out in AskMen, what is the one quality that can take a man from a "maybe" to a "yes" in your eyes?	Everyone's classified as a maybe (including the hot ones) until I know they see me as a person as opposed to an object. Also sentences like "rape is wrong" seem to be a decent indicator, you would not believe how common it is that guys think rape is okay! Oh, and of course, those lovely words: "I never want kids".	There was a guy I was somewhat interested in, then I saw him dance. I was like, I'm gonna get me some of that. Thought it would be my first summer fling, but we've now been together eight years.
What are some of your petty turn offs?	If I became single now... I shudder to think of the emojis I'd be subjected to. I fucking hate emojis. A "😂" and he would never see me again.	If you smack your lips when you eat or slurp everything you drink I'm never taking you out in public.
Men who have cheated, why did you?	My GF was a FUCKING BITCH to me, and along came a woman who made me feel good and happy. "Oh, you should have broken up with her first, you monster! There's no excuse for cheating!" Fuck that. If you want to have a good partner, you need to be a good partner. The way she'd been treating me, I didn't feel I owed her shit. I saw my shot at and I took it. It reminded me that female companionship can be fun and can make you feel good. No regrets.	She cheated on me repeatedly. I had no confidence at the time and kept finding ways to forgive her. When someone else finally *did* show an interest in me, it was easy to justify jumping on it. Really the basis for a very toxic relationship.
I'm getting a Brazilian wax next week. What are your tips for a first-timer?	definitely have a drink or two before. Trust me. Also, don't get waxed around when your period is. It makes us more sensitive to pain which I always thought was bullshit until I got a brazilian on my period. It ruined me for brazilians forever.	Wear cotton undies and wear a dress, skirt, or baggy pants. You might be a little sore after and friction won't feel nice.
Does anyone else feel like they can't vent to their girlfriends about crap their SO does because they don't want their friends to hate him?	Never had this problem before. I think maybe you need to find new friends you can be more personal with and not judgemental.	I'm not personally much of a venter in general, but I am frequently vented to. My experience, in general, has been that people who vent about their SOs usually only do that. So I'm never listening to a cute story about some minor romantic gesture or about a hobby they've started up together or whatever. It's just all negative all the time. So if I'm not also friends with their SO, this is literally all the information I have about them. As a result, my impression is obviously going to be negative. I can't speak for all women, but I actually like cute stories and seeing my friends happy. Really I'd rather listen to that than venting about some dumb argument. If the venting has to happen, I'd like to hear both the good and the bad (unless the good actually doesn't exist and my negative opinion is warranted).
Ladies, what do you really think when a dude brings you to his place for the first time? What impresses you and what is a total turn off?	Impressing: The bed sheets matching. Turn-off: Empty (or almost) beer cans. Cans are for the road, you use glass at home. Buy bottles. Don't buy cheap beer so you can drink a lot, buy good beer and enjoy it while it lasts. I don't mind you drinking it straight from the bottle, I hate doing the dishes too! But please, cans are for the road (Obligatory Don't Drink and Drive!) I'm 31 but thinking about it I haven't had any real relationship with someone who had their own place.. First one we both still lived with our (separate..) parents, 2nd he lived with his parents but we moved in together when I lost my own place, and the 3rd was living with his parents while the apartment he bought was being built with a massive delay, we broke up before it ever finished.	Biggest turn off: Filthy bathroom. Its not uncommon for me to go use the bathroom at a guy's place and find mold in the shower, streaks on the toilet, and pubes littering the floor. I always tell my guy friends, if you want women to stay over you HAVE to clean your bathroom. No one is going to want to spend the night here if they feel like they'll come out of your shower dirtier than when they went in.
How many of you got shafted on father's day?	Sounds like the mother in the house made her expectations clear. Did you also make your expectations clear? Did you state that you expected breakfast in bed? Or did you just kinda shrug and go "I don't care" and then get pissy when people treated it as something you didn't care about?	At my work, on mother's day weekend they sent out a nice email, bought us pizza both days and gave a flower to each mother on shift for mothers day. This weekend there was no email, no pizza, nothing at all. I thought that was pretty fucked up.
I'm a lesbian, what's the best way to politely "turn down" a man hitting on me?	You literally only get shitty responses? That's hard to believe - although I've become aware that different places have wildly different norms (catcalling for instance), so I'm not calling you full of shit here...just saying, based on my experiences it is hard to believe that most, let alone all, men would be shitty about it. But that aside, you're doing it right. If these are the responses you typically get, then I don't know how you can do it better. Nobody owes anybody even an explanation for why they are disinterested - I think we owe each other politeness if we are approached politely, that's it.	Don't offer an excuse. Just politely decline. A good dude will accept that, and a shitty one will act out in a way his own behavior will serve as a reason to tell him to fuck off.
I hear that girls in male-dominated classes like engineering and computer science get a lot of attention from the guys and get hit on a lot. Men in female-dominated classes (eg nursing, education), do you get the same treatment? If so, how often?	Heard second hand: the female drama majors are super horny and bored because the males are all gay. The few straight guys are exhausted all day like the single male lion servicing the pride.	Nurse here. It all depends on who you are working with actually. Ive worked places where nobody on my unit hooked up or was even single for that matter. Other places..... they can be coming left and right. But you learn not to shit where you eat. Plus they talk about everything from shitting, to their periods, to their boyfriends dick. So sometimes just hearing all that shuts it all down.
Do you think it's possible to be in a room full of food and through sheer force of will and self-control not eat anything until you die?	Absolutely not. Free will is only affects the rational part of your mind, and when push comes to shove thats actually a rather small and weak part.	I think some people may be able to pull it off, probably through intense meditation or some other method, but I don't think I or the average person could resist once actual starvation kicks in.
What has been your worst fuckboy experience?	I have straight up stories about fuck boys, I could go on for days. I experienced this one fuck boy who had this crazy girlfriend. Like she was insane. She found out about me and started stalking me on multiple phone numbers and accounts. I was in Europe studying abroad and shed blow up my phone. She sent her brothers to come to my house and beat me up. After much interrogation her brother admitted it to me and started crying about how the both of them bully him to do things he doesn’t want to do. The fuck boy became obsessed with me and wouldn’t stop calling me long after we banged. Even when he was in jail he called me. I blocked him cuz I saw on the snap chat map at 4 am that he was driving to my house	We sat down at a restaurant on our first date and he told the waitress “She’ll have a double vodka tonic, and I’ll have a water.”
What’s your pre-bed ritual like? How do you “switch off” before bed?	Step 1. Marry a spouse that is actually a child disguised as an adult male. (I suspect many men may be this.) Step 2. Get a full time job. Step 3. Have a child By the time my child’s bedtime comes around it is all I can do to get in her bed and put her to sleep. I fell asleep with her so often that I have learned to put PJ’s on before I put her down.	I fall in bed exhausted still wearing clothes and fall asleep telling myself I am just laying down for a second. I wake up at three am needing to pee, bush my teeth, and take off my pants. Then go back to sleep. My routine could be better.
is it OK to cuddle platonic friends ?	Is youre both straight women, yes. If you arent then of course not. Why give someone else the wrong idea? Why go outside of your relationship? Why put strain on someone else's.	Depends on the individuals involved. I have a very low threshold for physical contact from anyone I'm not related to or in a relationship with, so for me it would be a hard no.
Men of Reddit, for those of you who are introverted & considered good looking how has this combination been both a blessing & curse ?	That’s me. I’m glad I’m good looking because i would never have gotten laid if I just relied on my personality. The problem has been that I kinda just went along with women who were into me and made the first moves and who had more of a forward personality. I wasn’t as selective as I should have been and I ended up resentful a lot of times. Now I’m unhappily married and feel stuck because we have kids. Advice: be selective. There will always be another one around the corner. Force yourself to go outside your comfort zone. Watch Charisma on Command on you tube and work on yourself. Good luck!	It's hard for me to read signs and signals if someone is interested in me. Like I can tell blatant flirting. But subtle hints or clues I sometimes miss. Sometimes it's a blessing that I do but I regret the ones that I'm interested in so I just learned to go For it if I'm feeling it.
Do any of you have no/little sense of smell? How does it affect your life?	I love spices and can smell strong scents and a few smaller things like raim, but general stuff I can't smell. I generally will ask my boyfriend to smell check things that aren't obviously molding. Esstienally if I really want to smell, I need to shove in my nose It sucks but I can't smell most shitty things either, like New York City or Boston.	I have almost no sense of smell and my roommate and I got into a huge fight last week because apparently my cat was peeing everywhere and I had no idea. My roommate is very quiet and didn't say anything until it got bad enough for her to move out. I rarely have guests and no one has ever said anything. I'm not sure how to clean this up without just hiring someone because I still cannot locate the source of the smell. I've never been more embarrassed. :(
What's something you're good at that no one knows?	I'm pretty decent at singing. I used to be part of the choir at school, and got leads etc. I just don't like to do it in front of people much.	My handwriting got made into a paid professional font a few years ago. Also, some doodles I drew. I get paid monthly and it's on cards, invitations, journaling stuff and all sorts of things. A fontographer saw my writing when I was servicing the car and she asked me to work with her in making a paid font. Only my mom knows.
Men who hate your ex girlfriend(s), what did they do to warrant such hate?	Not hate because it would imply on some level that I care but if you’re to list some things it would be she charged too much on my credit, ordered my housekeeper of 20 years around like she was her personal assistant, destroyed a car I was letting her use and got a breast reduction. If I’m going to just nail it down to one thing though I’d definitely say the breast reduction was the deal breaker.	She cheated and lied to me multiple times. Took my money and my car and that was all I was good for. Made me feel worthless like I was less of a man and wouldn’t ever be good enough for her. I have a lot of trust issues now. Also trying to gain my confidence back. Long road ahead but I do wish her the absolute worst.
What was the worse advice you were given regarding women/girls?	“Nice guys finish last”, as a positive advice. Meaning, “you should always let a woman walk before you.” Really, the phrase is literal. The nice guys are the last ones to pair off. Don’t be nice.	“Bro, if she (insert meaningless every day activity or basic friendly human interaction), it means she wants you.” Sure, Brent. I’m pretty sure she smiled, asked how my day was going, and asked me my name was because I just ordered a coffee...but sure, she totally wants my junk. Why not.
Those who still live with parents/relatives or with roommates: what are some things you have decided you'll do differently when you're on your own with your own space?	DECORATING. Everything will be cuter and spookier at my future all-to-myself home. And organizing. While it saves money, I have the family who saves all the old containers (butter, plastic ice cream ones with lids, etc.) which only confuses me AND makes the fridge space usability inefficient. I'm particular to Sistema and snapware containers. My house will have many of these. edit: also, NO DEEP CHEST FREEZER THINGS. idk what possessed my parents that this was a good idea. I'm 23 and digging through that mess to find my frozen veg baggie pains me. :(	Oh god, both of what you already said. Also, not hanging onto food and condiments that we never use/that went off in 2010/etc. Basically downsizing everything, my family are hoarders. I'll also keep the bathroom really clean, without products freakin' everywhere. We also need a TV stand/case thing. At the moment it's perched on top of a big trunk and wires are EVERYWHERE.
What interior design trend needs to die?	Grey walls. You can pitch it as sophisticated all you like, but it is going to be the equivalent of beige or white in a short decade or so.	Words on walls. I don't need to be told to EAT in the kitchen, or that the HAPPY family is built on LOVE. Of course that is personal taste and I don't really care what people do in their own homes!
What is your experience with altering your “standards” for a potential SO?	I’m dating someone who may not have I️t all together financially but they never make me feel like I️ need to help them out or do anything for them. He’s fun to be around, accepting and very considerate of my feelings. But I️ worry that because he’s not some rich millionaire that people will judge me but honestly this is the healthiest relationship I️ think I’ve ever been in. What are your standards that you’re willing to overlook and which ones are your deal breakers?	I always said I wouldn't date a guy that doesn't enjoy reading. Dated a guy who read 1984 and Brave New World because I spoke about them a little bit. Found out two months into the relationship he only read them to impress me and by that time I liked the rest of him. I get my book love from other people instead
You have to eat 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of one food. You cannot eat anything else until you finish that food, but you have no time constraints. What food would you be totally fine with having to eat? Which food would make you hate everything about this situation?	Pasta with my moms gravy. I have been told that mine is better but for some reason I like my moms more and I somehow never get sick of it.	Good: Pizza. I could have it for every meal. Bad: Shellfish because damn I am allergic so I think I would either die of starvation or through anaphylaxis
Men, we've heard of the 'red flags' that make you nope out. What are your 'yellow flags'?	Filthy mouth. I cannot stand women that think it is attractive to talk like a bunch of dudes at the pub	black & white thinking. Not being able to see the "grey", the parts where you can agree on something in between. Makes fights pretty hard. Also seems stupid. You probably can live with it, but it can be hard in longer relationships. Edit: TIL some of you would not be able to be with my current GF
Guys who "ghost" girls after seemingly hitting it off, why do you do it?	Seriously???!!!! A girl is asking this question about how 'guys ghost?!' SERIOUSLY???? Being flaky and ghosting is every girl's middle-name, and I bet all of your friends would (probably) be masters of that game too. Ask them the reason(s) why they ghost/flake, and those would be similar to the ones many guys have to do the same.	We didn't hit it off as well as she thinks. If I'm with a girl and concluded that I'm not into her I'll often prod her and ask her lots of questions and followups about herself and she'll enjoy talking about herself. Most people do. I do it to get through the awkwardness and keep the conversation going, but usually I've checked out and its a low effort way to make it through the night. People love talking about themselves though, so after getting her to talk about herself all night they tend to walk way thinking it went well. I'll generally end it with a "I'm not that into you" before I head home, but a lot of people find it easier to say nothing than deliver the bad news in person.
Fellow Men what feminine traits or interests do you have that you tend not to share to fellow blokes?	I'm a fucking huge hip hop head, but Avril Lavigne is bae. Also, I enjoy shopping for clothes, spend a lot of time trying things on and take quite a bit of time in the morning to look good. I suppose I only really hide the 1st one.	I almost always sit down to pee. I live alone, so who's gonna know? Plus it gives me a chance to check my phone without worrying about dropping it in the toilet.
Have you had any "Holy shit, what am I doing with my life!?" moments recently, and what are they?	I dated so many assholes in my life lately and now I decided to stick to stop lowering my standards. Sure I may be young but dating ain't easy this time around.	Yep. I graduated college in 2009 with a degree in sociology with the aim of doing something in criminal justice or law enforcement. I couldn't get hired in those fields, so I just took a well-paying job in IT. I'm still in IT, and a year or two ago I got super frustrated I'm still not even in the field I wanted. I applied to the FBI--got to an interview, then rejected. Was all set to join the Navy Reserve as an intelligence specialist--got discharged for a minor surgery I had to have done while waiting to ship out. Now it's mostly, "what am I doing with my life?"
Why do I fall for girls so damn quickly?	Because instead of actually trying to fuck them or actually fucking them, you spend time imagining your non-existent 'love boat stories' with them. It's not exactly fucked-up, but it's a bit messed-up and a bit off.	You have no options so when a girl pops in you have +1 option. Then when you dont get her you cry about it until a new option comes along. Infatuation pushes you to try since you dont try in your daily life Solution: realise every girl you dont talk to is an option for a girlfriend.
What prejudices do you have about people based on their hobbies or interests?	If I see a young guy with a man bag, I assume he spends a healthy portion of his life on reddit, and parrots the frequently mentioned social issues around here verbatim despite having not looked into them himself. He's probably also unironically used the word "Drumpf" 10-20 times irl, doesn't like mainstream music, and makes sure everyone knows	Anime people are socially awkward. Horse people are crazy and spoiled. I love anime and nerdy stuff like that. Just not a fan of a lot of the people that become obsessed with it. Not a horse person.
What’s the smoothest way you’ve asked someone out/been asked out?	dinner after a bad exam I had a bus at late hours so asked if we could dinner to make time for my bus also that after math exam gone wrong sadness makes anyone want to eat out	I worked in my school library part time in high school. New kid came to the front desk and we were chatting. He slid me his number on an index card and said he was hoping to check me out. EDIT: Those of you PMing me are very sweet! No we didn’t date. My long time partner was cute in how he asked me out too. We were making out for the first time and all of a sudden he pulls away breathing heavy (asthma). Between bursts of air he frantically says “can I ask you out?!” I said yes. Big pause. Then a very breathy “will you go to dinner with me?!” I said yes. Lots more enthusiastic asthma-inducing kissing after that.
Have you been with someone older (7+) while in your teenages years? Did you regret it after growing up?	Since some people want a bit more information on my situation : I am 15, he's 24. I'm not that worried about it, except of course for my parents reaction. He's more worried about it being wrong than I am. I also seem to see a lot of posts here agreeing with the fact I shouldn't be with him. I just have trouble understanding why. He really makes me feel happy. I just don't feel attracted by people my age, I find them too immature.	When you're 15 and dating an older guy, you feel like the coolest girl in the world. When you hit your 20s, you will realize just how creepy and weird that guy must have been.
How to talk to my male friend about women not approaching him (feeling ugly)?	I may be late in saying this, but tell him to get off his ass and do something about his mindset. Specifically, to stop caring about other people's perception of him. That's not gonna do him any good in the long run. Is he a real nerd? Then get him to own that nerdiness. Try to convince him that it may be a good idea to get a new wardrobe that reflects *him* especially at work. Also, haircut, again have him find one he likes.	Nothing you tell him is really going to change anything, he’s locked him self into that mindset. Ideally, he’ll need to change a few things about his appearance, contacts or lasik to ditch the glasses, change his clothing style, hair style too perhaps, get out more, and work on his confidence. I swear to god, women pick up on confidence likes sharks do blood.
If your local foodery named a special after you, what would the dish be, and what would it be called?	The Bleeding Asshole: Two large and fresh, steamed turds. Delicately wrapped in fried bologna and prosciutto. Featuring a light and fragrant crushed tomato sauce drizzled generously.	Mine would be called thunderjugs and it would be two chicken breasts stuffed with cheese, spinach, and bacon then battered, deep fried, and smothered in special sauce.
How would 13-year-old you feel about your current SO?	13yo me would be jealous of current me. Hes everything 13yo me would have wanted. Cute, into emo music (even though we are both past dressing that way haha) into computers, caring, tall. If i told past me, either past me would be jealous or wonder how i tricked him hahah	I think 13 year old me would be completely smitten over my boyfriend. I’m pretty sure as far as looks go my taste has always been the same, looking back at kids I had crushes on when I was in school they all look the same: dark hair, dark eyes and tanned skin. However 13 year old me would’ve wanted to be married with kids by now (I’m 24) but I don’t want marriage or kids now.
What aspects of being in a relationship do you suck at?	Showing and being honest with my emotions--whether that's showing that something he did hurt me or that I feel strongly about him. My husband is the only man who's ever really known how I felt, and known that he can hurt me and that he's extremely, ridiculously loved by me. I tend to pretend that people can't hurt me because I'm just not that invested, but I'm actually quite sensitive--I just hide my feelings from the rest of the world. It feels both scary and amazing to trust this one person with my vulnerabilities.	I focus on making my partner happy and forget about making sure I'm happy too. I am also far too forgiving and apologize even when I'm not wrong just to resolve conflict.
What are things that ladies should know about attracting a guy?	This is a disingenuous question. Ladies know how to get a guy. It's easy. What you're really asking is "what should ladies know about attracting a top tier guy?"	If you want to attract a guy's attention in a group setting: * Make it less of a group setting by pretending he is the only one there. That being said, don't attach yourself to him like a leech. * Initiate and continue the conversation. There is no reason the guy needs to be the one who will carry the conversation If the two of you are alone: * Eyes, eyes, eyes. Make eye contact. Don't stare into them all the time, that's creepy, but like 75/25 ratio. * Make some kind of contact: arms, hands, back, hair. If you want to send a really clear message, hold his hand.
Men of Reddit, what was the biggest "reality-check" you've gotten?	I never had any luck dating. I had a good job. I had friends. I was working out 6 days a week lifting and running marathons. I went to speed dating 3 nights. I didnt get one date. I realized I can like myself self. Genuinely be proud of who I was. Be the person I want to be by my definition, and none of that matters. Its not enough to get a date. Self improvement as a way to get the life you want as far as dating and SO's was all BS.	How I couldn't even get a call back for an entry level job after I graduated. Even when I had 3 summers of relevant internship experience and graduated with a bachelor's degree in a STEM field. I'm going to be finishing my Master's degree in December and I'm still worried about finding a job.
What's something gross/unappealing about you, that any future/current SO HAVE to accept about you?	I pick my nose and hate doing dishes. Also my bedroom is constantly full of clothes, it's not gross or moldy food or used tissues or anything just, clothes everywhere. Oh, and I don't brush my teeth. Everyone in my family does and theirs are FALLING OUT and awful. Mine are a bit yellowed but otherwise perfectly healthy with 0 cavities in over a decade.	I have ingrown hairs all over my legs, so they're always filled with small red spots. I've had them since I was like ten and no amount of exfoliating will get rid of them :( But oh well, I'll still wear shorts because life's too short!
Men. By around 30 do you think all the best women are off the market?	This sounds like a really shitty perspective to have. Implying that youth is the most valuable quality of a women? I mean, is like someone in their mid twenties an old hag? Because what the hell... single digit age gap is normal, usually not 9 years say but 6? I don't get this question.	Some people would say that if a person isn't married by age 30, there must be a reason behind it. I would say: there is probably a story behind it. Many things in the world are like this. No real reason why it's that way, but there is a story of how it came to be.
What are your awesome lady-oriented life hacks that you feel everyone else should know about?	Nooo! Don't put bras on backwards! ): It kills the life of the bra. It stretches it out so much faster.	For the bra, to ensure your breasts are filling the cup properly, you should bend over after putting it on, and gently adjust how they're seated. They should fill the cups completely without being pressed down against your ribs, or spilling over the sides or top. If any of that is happening, you have the wrong size bra.
Singles Ladies of long periods of time (5+ years): How do you cope with the hard days?	I do not understand the need people feel to be in relationships. I know I am mostly unique in my feelings. I have been in serious relationships, the longest lasting 6 years, followed by 3 years. I’ve been single for about 7 years now. I have absolutely no interest in dating. I love being single. To me, a relationship is more work than it is worth. I do not like my thoughts and feelings to be “hijacked” by someone else. It gives the impression of happiness, sure. But I much prefer to rely on myself. Maybe I am selfish, though not a day goes by where I am upset that I am alone.	I've been single for all 24 years of my life. The only time it sucks is when I don't have close meaningful friendships.
What are signs on a date that a woman is using you for free food?	Who is seriously that pressed for a free meal that they'd spend several hours talking with someone they have zero interest in? This really doesn't sound like a common problem that you should be worried about. Most women with normal jobs can pay for their own meal, unless they're hard up or homeless and haven't had steak in years.	If you suggest coffee or a date and she counters with dinner. If you suggest a reasonably priced pizza place and she counters with something expensive. If you ask how she likes to handle to the bill on first dates after she suggests dinner and she wants you to pay.
Any other Canadian women excited by our new Cabinet having 50% women for the first time in our history?	What people SHOULD be excited for is having the best people for the job. Picking 50/50 just to say you have equal half men and half women is irresponsible. I want the best people on the job. Whether thats 100% men, 100% women or any split in between I don't care I just want this country fixed and prospering again	I'm very excited about the women and First Nations in the Cabinet. One of the MPs from my province (B.C) is a FN woman (Jody Wilson-Raybould) with an amazing background, who I'm very hopeful about specifically.
Dads of Reddit, what's it like to have a daughter?	I was not prepared for how much I was looked at/treated like a pedofile for being in public with just my daughter and myself.	9 months in. It's awesome. She's a cool person, despite not being able to do too much. Her personality is just starting to develop. I think she got my mischief streak. She looks like her mom. Smiles like me. It's cool to see parts of you and your personality in another person - especially one you made with someone you love.
What's the fastest time you've hooked up with someone you just met?	From meeting to sex in under 5 minutes. There was one that was like 30 seconds. I was in a bar she comes up unzips my pants and starts stroking me basically led me to the parking lot.	I had a decent looking girl come up to me at a party and asked me if I wanted to have sex with her because she just caught her boyfriend cheating. I obliged, and took her back to my place and fucked her. Woke up in the morning, fucked her again, cooked her breakfast and she left and I haven’t seen her since and still to this day only remember her first name and that she was sorta hot :P
How does being an overweight woman affect your everyday life?	I'm no longer overweight, but I spent a few years in that category in my early to mid 20's before making a conscious effort to get healthier. I had been a normal weight, then put on some pounds in grad school. Physically, I was constantly tired, always needing to take a nap and never feeling fully rested. Running, an activity I had done for years, became a painful chore. My back would ache after sitting in my office chair for a few hours. Socially, I avoided photos and shopping for clothes. I was dating and looking back I did find people were attracted to me, there were a few instances of some friends I wanted something more with but they did not feel the same way. Hard to tell if it was due to my weight or other factors although the weight probably didn't help.	I don't think it affects me too much based on what other people think/do, because I don't notice anything. But the way I feel about myself royally sucks. It is a constant cycle of trying to eat better and exercise, followed by not seeing results, followed by "fuck it I'll eat what I want," followed by the shame and guilt of eating absolute shit, and then starting over with trying to eat better. Repeat cycle indefinitely.
Men with significant others: what's the weirdest/craziest/most blatant way somebody has tried to get with or flirt with your SO?	Most blatant from the other side: I met a hottie, clearly with her boyfriend. We were talking for a bit. I'm getting flirty, he's about 6ft away. She had this awesome fur collar on, and I asked if I could touch it. She said yes, and then I petted it and said "Oooooo that's soft." She just looked at me like "wow." Didn't speak to me after that, but heh what a thrill, I do what I want. Probably wouldn't have taken it further, I just like to play :)	One of my SO's "friends" has the hots for her. It is actually really funny, I've been introduced to him once and he didn't even make eye contact. There was one great story about it, once at a bar whenever I'd leave he'd come over to talk to my SO and when I'd return he'd vanish. I told my SO about the phenomena and she didn't believe me. So I would walk away and come back, I did it like six times and everytime he'd run away as soon as I walked back. Hahaha, once it was even in the middle of his sentence. My only thought is that the dude thought I would fight him over my SO if I saw him talking to her, which I wouldn't, but it would explain the behavior.
What's your favorite no-meat recipe?	Dumplins are always a great go-to when cooking veg. Ya can fill ya dumplins with anything, literally ANYTHING! Carrot shavins, cheese, quinoa, some soy protein, beans, lentils, spices, ya name it, ya can put it in a dumplin. And then ya gotta make some sweet, sweet dippin sauces to go along! Mmm boy! So what ya do is, ya make two or three kinds o' dumplin n two or three kinds o' dippin sauce n then serve em up! Baby, ya got yaself a lil' dumplin fest goin' on! Three dumplins n three dippin sauces is nine flava combos! Get ya bad self some dumplins!!	a little less than 2.5 dl of red lentils replaces 400 g of mince meat. i use cooked and drained lentils instead of meat for pretty much every sauce-based dish that requires crumbled meat - spaghetti sauce, taco meat, chili con carne, shepard pie, etc. if you just add a bit extra salt, i can pretty much promise you won't miss the meat!
Whats an unfortunate truth every man has to accept at some point?	If you don't have money your chances with pretty women decrease exponentially. You'll have to settle for other people's rejects	No one is coming to help you and you need to do this yourself. The sooner you realise this, the more control you take and the prouder you can be when it's done.
Men of Reddit: You’ve had a long and stressful day and you need to unwind. Which activity, beverage and snack/meal will help you with this?	Three 20 mg hydrocodone or 2 xanax bars 5 nips of jack Daniels Tennessee fire, a six pack of Heineken and watching a funny or uplifting movie I never seen before from a hot tub	I usually destress with a nice game of Cities: Skylines, until I have to deal with solving traffic at least
What was the worst time when "only for boys/men" was used against you?	My sister and i as kids (both in early 20's now) weren't allowed to play game boys and video games bc they were "for boys." So now I nothing about gaming... And my bf is an avid gamer 🙄	I asked my dad once to teach me how to change a tire just in case I get stuck in the middle of nowhere and need to do it, he told me "that's not something taught, is something boys just know/are showed, girls don't do that" and then questioned me later as to why I didn't change my tire when I had to walk a ways to get help for a flat tire while stuck one time
How the fuck do I buy an engagement ring without knowing my girlfriend's ring size?	Think twice about signing your life away dude. Note the divorce rate. Note that prenups aren't valid in many countries. No reason you can't just live together until "one of you" changes their minds. And she will.	Stick her finger in your mouth while asleep and hold your lips in that position till you find the time to visit a jeweller...
If you asked a girl out and she said yes but said "I'll let you know when" regarding the day, what would you do?	She doesn't really want to. There is often a huge difference between the words people say and what they really mean. She's not the girl for you. Find others.	She said she'd let you know. If she is interested, she will. If she's not interested, she won't. Taking things like this at face value in an early stage of dating is a very effective and low-cost way of weeding out people who you shouldn't waste your time on because they're not ready to invest the energy required.
What’s the difference between cute and sexy?	cute from a girl means “do you even lift?” you get treated like a friend and a brother because her arms are bigger than yours. read between the lines.	Both cute and sexy are physically attractive. However IMO, cute is endearing in a way the evokes emotions of care, affection and fondness. Sexy/hot is sexually provocative and evokes lust and desire. A woman who can be either (and I'd add "elegant/classy" as a third category) depending on what situation she's in will be quite powerful in getting the responses she wants from people. EDIT: Good to see people enjoying this. I've been classifying outfits and makeup looks between three poles with this system for a while. Cute: adore me Elegant: admire me. Sexy: desire me. EDIT 2: /u/Cassian_And_Or_Solo [did a great version for men!](https://ps.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/c0c807/whats_the_difference_between_cute_and_sexy/er4oest/)
Men of Reddit who travel, what is the best, underrated place to go? Why?	The NJ beaches are pretty nice. From Avalon to Ocean City and even Wild Wood. Those are some nice places to go for a few days.	Malta is really cool. It has loads of history, having had a knightly order there and has many of Caravaggio's best works. As a former british colony, it's really easy for an english speaker to live there. That also makes it a really odd place, as it feels very much like a mediterranean country, but they also drive on the left and have british plugs. There's also some cool nature stuff - the famous Azure Window is no more, but there are lots of cliffs and other places like it. Also the migrant crisis seems to have more or less passed it by.
How would you feel about a woman wanting to masturbate before sex?	I don’t think that I would want to sleep with someone who couldn’t orgasm with their partner(s). I’d probably pass.	Sounds like a reasonable request. Throw it at the bedroom wall, and see if it sticks. If it was me, I'd enjoy watching her get herself off. Alternatively, take the time to teach him how to get you off via masturbation. When the woman cums first, it takes a lot of performance pressure off the guy to not cum too early. A lot more time enjoying the sensations and alot less time thinking of baseball stats.
What’s one gender stereotype that grinds your gears?	That real men don’t cry/get sad/talk about their feelings etc etc. This mindset has ruined, and taken, so many lives.	That women are naturally inclined to be caregivers. That women just "do housework better" than men do. That women are less logical than men. That men are better with strategic decisions than women. That women will feel horrible or guilty if they work full-time when they have children. That men are incapable parents. ...I don't think I can pick one.
How would you positively teach resilience and strength to young men, without falling into the trap of the "never show weakness, suck it up" mentality?	i grew up with that "be strong, don't be weak" approach that OP mentions. It is a bad mindset to have. But I managed to turn it into an embrace of stoicism. It's not bad to process your feelings yourself or to take time to think through things and solve your own problems as best you can. It means you are available to help others. I guess I'd try to pass on the stoic approach	Resilience and strength are not necessarily taught, rather formed in the face of adverse circumstances. The only reason I'm resilient and strong is because I had to be to make it on my own, and those qualities were byproducts of working hard to move forward in life. The best way to teach these qualities is through example.
What's one of your preferences/dealbreakers that would make Reddit angry?	If he asks me out, he must pay on the first date. If he doesn't, we won't have a second date. Also, he must be at least tall-ish, not overweight and not a gamer. But I don't think those are as controversial.	I won't date someone with a mental illness who isn't willing to get help and take medicine. I don't care, i'm not there to be an emotional pillar for them, it's just not something I want to do.
Women who are independent, how? What helps you keep pushing to thrive to be independent, fo fly solo?	I was raised that way! My mom taught me that you can't trust everyone by their words and that people leave. So I always need to have a Plan B and C in place. Also, I'll be damned if someone ever gave me an allowance. F*** that 😁	I was just born wired this way. My brain gets a chemical rush from forging my own way, having power over myself and my life, making my own decisions, and taking my own risks. I enjoy achievement. I also don’t feel lonely. It’s just not something I experience. I have more fun when I have friends and a partner, sure. But I moved across the country by myself just before the pandemic and spent a year of quarantine living totally alone in a foreign place, not leaving my house at all. Didn’t ever feel lonely tbh. I just kept myself occupied. So I think it’s just my brain. I’m naturally happiest when I don’t have to depend on anyone, and I don’t experience the same downsides to independence that others might.
Why do you think it is that I see so many guys say that they wish women would approach more and ask guys out YET so many women say that when they do so the men react poorly to it?	Can we get a tally here? Female, I've approached two men, wasn't rejected by either. Women have you approached men? Were you rejected? Men, have you been approached by women? Did you reject them? I'm just curious because I've never heard of what you are speaking of until today.	A man who has no problem being asked out isn't necessarily going to want to go on a date with any woman who asks him out. He has to actually be interested in her. I've heard women who decided that asking men out "didn't work" after getting rejected a handful of times. They need to separate "he didn't want to go on a date with me" from "he doesn't want to go on a date with any woman who asks him out". If a man got rejected once or twice and decided that "women don't like being asked out" then you could see the nonsense in that, right? With that said, there do exist men who have a problem being asked out by women. I don't think they're a majority, but they do exist.
Who else feels like he should work out more when seeing beautiful women?	Meh? Most of the kinds of women who'd set me to drooling don't notice anything that isn't on their cellphone screen. I could be buffed out like Schwarzenegger and they'd still be oblivious. I work out because I want to be healthy and have a better quality of life. Getting women isn't hindered by my looks so it's a non issue for the time being.	I actually get the feeling more often when I see fit men. Beautiful women actually make me self conscious to work out on account of boner through gym attire.
Hypothetical question: Would you leave your significant other for someone who was a better fit for you?	No because the genie would be lying. Even if it was true, I made a commitment and I love my husband. No way a hypothetical 'better' person would make me happier	i don't believe in "trading up" people. part of relationships are the legacies you build, the times you spend together. sure, there might be someone out there who loves YA novels as much as i do, loves turkey sausage as much as i do, and wants nothing more than to live in a cabin in the woods. but that doesn't mean i would want to be with that person instead of the person i'm with. so, no. and i am 27.
Men of Reddit, what is your best move in bed?	Depends on the gal and what she likes. Fisting is fun. Varying between long strokes and short strokes is typically another good one. Getting them to squirt. The Hitachi. Dom/sub play. The possibilities are endless.	I have a good fingering technique down. Slowly massage the vag, then rub the clitoris ever so gently. Proceed to stick a single finger in the vagina. continue adding your fingers until your whole fist is in. slide your arm slowly into her, once you reach your shoulder limbo in with your head, and forcibly insert your other arm, torso, and legs. You are now free to control her. When you feel the job is done, finish by giving birth to yourself. Found this on yahoo answers years ago
Women with autism: what are social issues you deal with that you're not sure men with autism have to deal with?	1. people telling me to smile all the damn time. i don't hear anybody telling stony-faced men to smile. 2. expecting me to be naturally comfortable with and desirous of holding babies thrust into my arms with no warning and to know what i'm supposed to do with them until i can give them back. again, i never see this with male relatives, nobody expects them to be interested in babies. 3. being helpfully told how i could be prettier when i didn't ask and did not previously feel self conscious! thanks >:/	I'm not treated harshly at all since most people can't tell that I have it. Most just think I'm slightly strange. Since the pressure to be social is ingrained from birth for women, in general, women with autism (at least higher functioning ones) get really good at mimicking proper social behavior by the time we are adults.
What is your problem?	I have no idea what I'm doing with my life - I procrastinated too long to apply to some of the schools I was going to, and most of the jobs I am interested in require a PhD. Or a security clearance I can't get due to my citizenship. Or both. So basically I've made a number of *very bad decisions* in the past 4 years because I didn't have a plan, and now it's too late to fix them. Woo! Oh, and my therapist brought up antidepressants this morning. Mostly to tell me it would probably be a good idea, but since I have no idea what I'm doing with my life she doesn't feel comfortable starting me on them because it's quite likely we'd have to discontinue and stuff. *What a time to be alive!*	i am very prone to bad (excessive) habit forming, in terms of food, weed, anything that I get enjoyment out of. "this feels good... why not do it all the fucking time?" is usually how my brain operates.
Men, which subreddits have you been banned from and why?	Ask Reddit because i made a Jew joke even though it wasn’t a serious post and everyone else was joking around. I am not racist i just make dark humor jokes since i find them funny as hell	i got banned from r/nyjets because they asked for suggestions for the sidebar image and nobody posted anything for days so I posted a gif of the buttfumble
What are some signs that you might overlook when you should leave a relationship?	The way your partner treats their parents and siblings. This is how you can expect to be treated once you’re comfortable together.	When you are mocked more than you are supported. That you are mocked at all. When you are called derogatory names during an argument.
Men, how do you usually refuse a girl?	I'm not the kind of guy that girls approach when they're attracted to me. One of my old high school friends who had a crush on me (but was in a relationship) told me that I came across as mysterious. I don't really buy it, but then again I don't really see myself the way others see me. I think women just give me signals and wait for me to come talk to them, which I wouldn't do even if I was attracted to them because I have better things to do than worry about dating. Which is kind of funny, because girls are more attractive to me when they make the effort to actually be my friends first.	I'll try to distance myself from physical contact and conversations will never be more than small talk. Pretty much all girls I've come across seem to take the hint.
Cold &amp; flu season is upon us! Ladies who never get sick, what are your secrets?	I attribute my low carb diet and increased water intake to a lot of health benefits - losing weight, reduced anxiety, next to no migraines, better sleep and a tougher immune system. Whether it's true or not, I have no idea. But whenever I'm eating this way, I don't get sick. I used to constantly.	Flu shot works wonders for me, vitamins don't hurt either but I usually forget to take them. Lots of hand washing too!
What's the creepiest or most unsettling person you have ever met? What made them so disturbing?	There's a woman who walks around the town I live in, she has a walking cane and is always dressed in long black dresses and skirts. She looks like a witch and gives off this terrible vibe! Her eyes look dead... She hasn't done anything particularly creepy that I know about, but the few times I've seen her she's irked me. The closest I've been to her is walking up a ramp at a shopping center and she was behind me. I had chills and I don't know why. She could be a lovely lady, but something about her is just so off.	A co-worker's cousin at a cook out. He had dead eyes and a weird vibe. He looked at everyone kind of weird, but the way he looked at women felt predatory. Any time I broke from conversations with others, he appeared. He kept bringing up how people are touch-starved these days, especially men. I just kept saying, "that's deep" and would dart off to find someone to talk to. The fourth time he brought up men being touch-starved, he asked what guys should do and got way too close. I told him he should get out my face and go get a fucking 10-minute chair massage.
What's the most impressive dad-reflex moment you've witnessed?	Once my kids were wrestling outside the house. One of them was slamming the other up against it. Quick as I could, I ran out there to put an end to it, and gave them a scolding. Luckily, the siding was OK.	I was at a hockey game with my dad, and a puck escaped the rink. I didn't see it coming for me. But my dad did. Snapped his hand out, and caught the puck as soon as it was near my face. Then he casually handed the puck to me.
Stoic men of reddit, what is something we ladies should know about dating the strong silent type?	It's an appearance. Strong silent types may or may not stay strong and silent if you actually like talk to them.	Nothin irritates me more than when I go somewhere to sit and have a drink and be with my own thoughts and someone starts with the "you need to smile more! Why are you so quiet!?"
What’s the worst thing a girl has called your little curly fry?	My ex had an 8 inch, and I had grown used to that length. Next boyfriend came along with only 6 inches, and I accidentally let "oh wow so-and-so's was 8." That relationship ended quickly	I'm Asian and rock a solid 4.5er. An old partner once said "oh my God it's so big!" and I just looked at her strange, like come on. I know I'm not big at all so why do you gotta say that... Totally killed the mood. My current girlfriend looked at me seriously once, she may have even put her hand on my chest, and said, "You know, when it's soft it is so small but it grows so much! It's surprisingly big!" That one actually made me feel good - but she also said I was the smallest guy she slept with a few days after saying this so..
Men who prefer posting here to Askmen, why do you?	If I wanted a male perspective on something I'd just think about it. This sub let's me get a perspective on issues from the opposite sex. Though I will say that AM's shitposts and mod rants are far superior to the AW ones. You ladies need to step up your shitposting game.	Every question in /r/AskMen is about one of four things: 1. Sex 2. Fitness 3. Sex fitness 4. Fit sexness This sub is far more varied in it's questions. Also, piggybacking off /u/Ramblonius, I am not learning anything new from AskMen.
If dating supposedly becomes easier for certain men in their 30s, then why can't social life and making friends be the same way?	Because women in their 30s who are single have realised they're not the cream of the crop and have lowered their standards. They've finally realised they're not going to marry the captain of the football team no live happily ever after. Either that or they're divorced/single moms who are very desperate.	Because idiot teens and college kids aren't lining up to hang out with an older guy because he's interesting. Dating is easier for them because younger women find them more appealing. Totally different dynamic from making friends. Making friends is harder because everyone is married, has kids, or their career, and not much reason to meet new strangers.
What stereotype about men has the most negative effects on women?	That women are less rational/are crazy. It invalidates us, and it's a convenient go-to for whenever some douche doesn't understand and/or likes what he's hearing.	That men are hapless at housework and childcare. Women are automatically expected to be maternal and the primary caregivers because our society acts like if you leave a guy alone with a kid long enough it'll end up sticky, starved, and tied to a car roof rack going "wheeeee!" as Daddy speeds along the motorway.
What things does your SO do to keep you feeling giddy and excited?	He calls me "babalooski" when he's really happy. It's such a silly thing that started out as "babe." And he says it in a silly voice. It always makes me feel so incredibly special and I couldn't tell you why. Also when he calls just to chat. He haaates talking on the phone, so I know when he does that it's just for me. It's nice that he goes out of his way to do something that makes me happy. (:	Some days it's just the way he looks at me, or gives me a forehead kiss, or anything tender really. It's just a fleeting moment that it feels like an electric shock running through me. It's beautiful. On a smaller scale it's every time he tells me he misses me.
What random/non-sexual/innocent things does your SO do that you find super adorable?	My boyfriend often kisses my belly as in me being pregnant (but im not and i have a flat abs). But he always says he wants to kiss our future baby long before he/she will be concieved just to make he/she feel even more welcomed into this world. I find it adorable!	She likes to pick me up and carry me around. There's little difference between us in size (I'm only 1.5 inches taller and 12 lbs heavier) and she can carry me with ease just as I can to her. At weekends we have a day were one of us carries the other down stairs in the morning and upstairs to bed at night. Saturdays I carry her, Sundays she carries me.
At what point did you notice that traditionally 'nerdy' things become mainstream?	When I see bimbos on instagram dressed as Misa Amane from Deathnote for Halloween. Gag. Like cool, what did you see the shitty Netflix rendition and then watch a couple episodes of the series and now you’re super anime chicc xmx	Well in the case of Marvel / DC i'd say its obviously due to the popularity of the movies. I don't think the comics side is seen as mainstream yet though, at least not in my country. I'm in the forces in the UK, and most the guys here love Marvel/DC. We even use the Avengers theme in a lot of our parades. I always find that weird.
Those of you who found out you were the "other woman," did you contact the SO with proof of the cheating? What was the outcome?	No. I didn't contact the SO and still would not. I have never known the women and didn't feel it was my place. I just ended it, told the dude what a scumbag he was, and moved on.	I did. My now ex fiancé turned out to have never dumped his high school girlfriend. She didn't care. He'd done this for so long, she was immune to it. Eventually, I do believe she ended things for good, as the last time we spoke, she had cut things off after what he did to the both of us.
What are your favorite things about other women?	Considering I more or less worship women (mental Illness yay) this thread is like an odd bible to me. At the same time, I don't really have anything to contribute, because as someone who regrettably can't claim the title of "women" I don't really know if a trait or behaviour is something that I have evidence for or if I've just made up.	They are always willing to give you a tampon/pad when you in need. I find men and women have more in common that people give them credit for but that is one thing they can't understand nor are they ever prepared for.
What are the actual steps that happen between meeting someone and having casual sex?	Don't talk to her like a friend from the beggining be charming Funny confident tease tease her If you want sex you have to portray that in yourself Think how girls make themselves look sexy You have to do the male version of that You attract what you put out always If you want sex make it obvious you don't want anything else If you want it to be casual then you can't let emotions feelings life troubles get into your head you have to be confident trustworthy etc Make yourself into a guy girls want to bang	> what's the "one-thing-led-to-another" part? Both parties send signals, one of them escalates things with physical contact like touching a hand or leg and then, if the other party doesn't reject that offer, moves on to kissing and eventually foreplay. Sometimes things can be kind of blurry even after all that in which case I'll ask how far she wants to take things. I'd assume that movies and pop culture tend to skip these steps because showing an hour of flirting, making out and touching would be boring.
Men, how do you feel about women approaching you at the gym?	When I'm at the gym I'm there to work out and blow off steam. Leave me alone, at least until I'm done.	More than happy for a girl to approach me, however, I do feel creepy approaching a girl in the gym
How does your life at your current age compare to your mother's life at that age?	22- she had just married her high school sweetheart, was a homeowner and working part time in a medical office. 22- living with bf/future hubby and our Australian shepherd. Just graduated college with a double BS and working as a nanny. We are still a couple years away from marriage :)	At 33, my mother had four boys who were approximately ages 10-15. She was a stay-at-home mom (I think) and fairly happily married to my father. She had no education after high school and would go on to have two more children (my other brother and me). She was very religious (still is) and close to her family. I'm 33, divorced, and live alone with my dog. I work writing tank manuals and am working on a master's degree. I have a boyfriend and am not religious at all.
What is your "I probably shouldn't be here" story?	Russ (the singer from my old band) and I are hanging out with some friends, and some ladies, and the ladies say they'd like to go to this one club. I'd been there before, was a gay club. I'm a straight guy, but I love gay clubs. Real talk, if you're cool with your sexuality, gay clubs are fucking fun as hell. Girls eat that shit up by the way, if you're cool enough with yourself to go with them to a gay club and actually have a good time, they'll dig you forever. Anyway, so we get to the club, right? Well, the club isn't a gay club anymore. The club is....well....it's decidedly darker than it used to be.... It was a club for hoods and hoodrats. We were white hardcore/punk dudes. Peaced it without even telling the girls, but they definitely didn't give a shit anyway.	Was 17. Went to go buy weed and my friend and I went to this dudes house. Come to find out my friend owed this guy a lot of money because my friend had a bit of a coke habit. Said dude pulled out a pistol and began beating my friend with it and pointed at him. Quickly said ima be in the car ran out and started the car and waited a minute. Friend came out totally bloody and with no weed. My friend died of a drug overdose within the next year. Hard drugs are dumb and can often put you in bad situations but prohibition which causes a lot of this violence & greed is dumber.
What's the most awesome thing anyone has said to you?	My husband and I walked out of a gated condo complex to a surface street in Vegas near the strip and this group of drunk people are walking by, one of them, a big shirtless guy turns to us and yells "TITTIES IN YO FACE! TITTIES IN YO FACE!" It was alarming and so unexpected at the time but we often laugh about it and say it at random inappropriate times.	When I first started dating the boyfriend, I asked him if he was sure he wanted to keep seeing me considering the distance. There was something about how casually he said, "Yeah, you're worth the effort" that made me a ball of happiness.
What exactly is progressive about letting your son wear a dress?	Does he identify as a female? I do think we are going full retard on the rejection of "gender roles".	Clothing is just fabric with the one logical purpose: protecting you from the elements. Every other purpose - fashion, in-group identification, etc. is subjective and remarkably arbitrary. In many cases, it's totally pointless. So a guy wearing a dress is fundamentally inconsequential whereas enforcing a "no men wear dresses" attitude perpetuates random social feelings. If you think about it, Greek togas and Japanese kimonos, typically worn by men and women both, are basically dresses. But nobody thinks twice (at least in ancient Greece or Japan) about a man in such attire because it conforms to their respective cultural contexts. tl;dr it's progressive because it fucks with cultural contexts
Have you ever passed up sex with a woman because it was the smart thing to do, and then you fantasized about it for the rest of your life?	A teacher I had in college.. I was 16yrs she must've been early 20s .. 24 I think.. Anyway she was petite with large perky firm looking breasts.. She would stare at Me and have long chats with Me... I just had zero fucking game.. My mind was bit of a mess.. Early stages of depression.. Then i played truant.. And when I finally returned.. She was gone .. I didn't even get to say goodbye. Every now and then when I'm 'tugging the bishop' I think about all the things I should've done.. God bless your tits Ms.Abbott.	Well. There was a crazy girl I messed with a bit long ago. She went down on me once. A few weeks later we had a really drunken hookup where neither of us "finished." I knew she was bad news so I wanted to cut things off. She sent me a text or message basically asking to try again, and the thought briefly crossed my mind that I could make her fulfill my fetishes. My brain prevailed, but for years I wondered what she would have been willing to do...
Have you ever realized that your best friend actually sucks as a friend?	3 of my bridesmaids all of a sudden decided they "couldn't" be at the wedding... And with only two months it'd be hard to find replacements. And then j realized I really don't have anyone to replace them with... My life is depressing...	We had been best friends for about 14 years. I realized it when I was sitting there one day about to send her a text message. I saw the last one had been a couple weeks earlier, and then thought about how I was always the first to reach out to her and if I didn't, I wouldn't hear from her at all. The days we would actually go out and get drinks or see a movie were great! It was like nothing had ever changed with us, but at some point she just stopped trying to maintain my friendship and I felt taken for granted. It makes me feel so sad that I am going through a hard time in my life (a separation with my husband of five years) and she doesn't even know about it.
What has been the most awkward date you have been on? How did it end?	My first and only Tinder date when I was about 23. We jumped right into a movie date which was a bad idea since we never spoke on the phone (hardly knew the girl). She had NO reaction to the movie besides maybe a smile or two? We jumped into a dinner date right after. Figured she might open up more... Small talk at first then... I got lectured for 45 minutes about feminism and perverts. The most awkward date I've been on. To top it off, I even tried kissing her.	I was 14, he was 19. I thought we were going to hang out with a mutual friend. We did eventually meet up with that friend for what I later realized was a double-date lunch. It was mostly just hours of uncomfortable walking around town and sitting at the park (where he tried to feel up my leg). He asked me twice why I was "so tense". When he finally drove me home, I was so relieved. My mom answered the door and promptly invited him to join us for dinner. She even had dessert. We never fucking had dessert. I wanted to cry.
Why are some girls only seen as a means to a good time and nothing worth investing in?	Few things here: * I personally think waiting 1 month is useless. Assholes will stick around anyways, you will just get hurt more. Either wait a considerable ammount of time (6 months+) and risk losing the good guys, or go for something more reasonable like 2-3 dates and you won't mind as much the rejection if it was an asshole. * The majority of girls on Tinder mostly go for the same guys. Those guys get so many matches and girls into them that they usually like to just fuck around. Maybe try to go for someone a bit less popular but more genuine. I know this is easier said than done thought. * Lastly, no idea what you look like, but looking your best helps keep all guys around. Easiest thing to be improved is usually losing weight.	You’re looking for commitment while being on tinder & dating apps, where that’s the exception not the rule/norm. You need to change where you’re looking for guys.
Men of Reddit: Who was the biggest douche bag you ever came across and why did they suck so bad?	I see them on a weekly basis at the gym flexing in front of mirrors, dropping weights and grunting/yelling regardless of how inappropriate it is. I don’t understand how some guys can be such enormous douchebags, the roids bring out the worst in them	Use to have an obese, divorced, pathetic unhappy sad sack of a manager at my job in HS who use to try to always tell me things starting off with "to be a man means you need to....". Meanwhile he was easily the laziest most arrogant douche I ever had the misfortune of working with.
What's an example of time when your instincts were bang on?	My instinct to wanna suck on abigail shaprios BIG BOOBA BAZONKA ROCKERS certainly helped me cause damn I want that milkey goodness	A month ago my girlfriend or ex was lovey dovey and all that. And she eventually started getting bitter and distancing figured we’d break up but I held a sit down asked how she felt about the relationship and if I needed to change anything. She stated all was fine. New Year’s Day comes and I lower my guard down and she breaks up with me yadda yadda yadda “I just need a break” etc. she already has a new guy lined up 😐 I wanna say I’m angry but I’ve learned from this experience the high road is the best way possible. Plus I met someone else who’s really cool and I just asked them out today
While having sex or making out with a guy, did he say or do anything that was an instant moodkiller?	Ahaha, I was JUST talking about this to some friends. My ex was really into chatting during sex, and I wasn't feeling tooo intimate. Essentially, I just wanted to get laid. Spooning position, he leaned over into my ear and asked, "yeah, do you like when I make love to you?" It was like he hit an instant "eject" button for my vag.	First time I had sex, my boyfriend at the time attempted dirty talk and said "Oh yeah... That's my DICK." I felt too awkward and it was too funny to continue. As I mentioned in another recent thread, the boyfriend before him called me mommy while making out. Ew, ew, ew.
men who got married because of a pregnancy/child birth, what's your story?	Got spermjacked at 21. Married. Spent my early twenties working two jobs, raising a child on my own, and horribly depressed. Dumped the dead-weight wife, did the single dad thing. Got remarried five years later, turns out that I can't pick them well, had a second child, dumped the second wife, now a single dad again. Never getting married again, there isn't a woman alive worth marriage anymore	My dad had a one night stand with my mom at Myrtle Beach at sixteen, that resulted in my older brother. They got married, finished high school, worked hard and made a life. Because of poor sex education at nineteen they had me. Over the course of the next ten years my dad put himself through night school at a local University and my mom started a business. when I hit teenaged they got empty nest syndrome and tried for a girl but got a pair of twins. I'd be lying if I said their marriage was perfect, but growing up I never knew how hard we sometimes had it. My parents are my heroes, and they love each other and their family very much.
Former AskMen smokers: How did you quit?	Third family member died of heart/lung disease. Didn't want to be the fourth. So I quit 'cold turkey'. I know this probably won't help you but that's just my experience.	Switched to vaping 2 years ago. The day the vape arrived in the mail, I quit, and it was pretty easy. I still crave the ceremony around cigarettes - beating down and opening a fresh pack, the fresh tobacco smell that always reminded me of raisins, the lighter, that first puff. I miss cigs. But I've tried then since and can't handle the taste anymore. I remember it being so much better than it really is.
Have you had an ex move on really quickly after your break up? How did it make you feel?	did not care. by the time i break up with them i'm long over them. also, him moving on didn't stop him from staying in my inbox with the drunk texts. poor that.	Sure. Made me feel like he never really gave a damn in the first place. Which I guess was kind of the case, since he'd been sleeping with her for the entirety of our relationship.
What are your favourite podcasts and why?	Not to be negative, but I hate pod casts. It's not just pod casts, it's talk radio too. And radio stations where the DJ's talk more than they play songs. I guess it's just me, but listening to other people talk bores the crap out of me. I would say it's because I'm old, but I've always been this way. Given how many folks enjoy this, I'm just weird.	My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's an advice show where they take the questions from Yahoo answers. The three brothers have hilarious banter and it's often brought me to laughing in tears. Also, The Adventure Zone. Same people as above, but their dad comes in as well and they play a game of D&D. Also hilarious.
When did you have to cut a person you cared for out of your life?	Around 5 years ago I decided to cut out all the people (I'm not gonna call them friends because you never know who is your enemy or friend) around me, because we moved to a new country and I was tired of their bullshit asking about new environment, deleted all my social media for the same reason.	I've never cut anyone out, but I've been cut out many times. I'm just posting here because I read all these stories and they made me sad and made me want to share. I'm a single 36-year-old single guy. My family isn't great so I've always loved my friends hard. The thing is most of them get married or move away and contact just sort of fades away until it's nothing more than the occasional happy birthday text and a promise to get together soon. It really sucks, but you can't fight it. It's just how things go here. It's just hard when you're always the one who values the relationship more.
Women who have been bridesmaids, what was your favorite bridesmaid gift you have received?	Bridesmaid GIFT?...I had to buy my own ugly dress, and was then forced to pay for a second night's stay in a hotel room for...REASONS? Oh yeah, and then there was the part about being kicked out of the rehearsal dinner for reasons I was not told directly, but having pretty much to do with Bridezilla's dysfunctional, drama-prone family. You get gifts if you're a bridesmaid? Hell, I was all of the bridesmaids and the maid of honor at the same time, and it was still an "honor" I wish I'd had nothing to do with. Cool for those of you who had a good experience with it, though! I just had no idea weddings could be anything more than a nightmare.	The last wedding I was in I was gifted a silky robe. I love it and still wear it around the house. Another bride gave me a wine glass with my initial painted on it. I don't use it because I don't want to mess the paint up, but I thought it was a pretty decoration for the house. Edited to add: At my wedding my husband made wine that we gave away to our bridal party. Everyone LOVED it and still talks about it almost 4 years later.
Women of reddit who are in their late twenties or thirties but don't yet feel grown up, what would have to change in your life (or how you live) in order for you to begin feeling like an "adult" in how you think of yourself?	30 here! I got married at 19 before I get to finish college in a different country . Moved to a new country then had my firstborn a year later and have been stay at home mom of 3 since then. Never been able to work an actual job except for cleaning and other side gigs. I don't even care about finishing college I have been always dependent on my husband so getting a job and being financially independent is all I want in my life!	I’m 30. I have a house, a husband, and 2 children. I have come to terms with the fact I will never feel like an “adult”
How do you like a woman to treat your dick after a blowjob?	Whatever you do, don't start giving me that "eww, icky, it's gross and sticky" kinda of face or hand gesture. Also, if you aren't swallowing, you should be on cleanup duty. Other than that, you can still stroke it slowly, who knows, I might be up for round 2 in just a bit. Not as much mess 2nd time around, if you catch my drift! ;)	Clean me off with your mouth if you can, then maybe kiss it some and we can cuddle after or something.
Have you ever bailed /been bailed on DURING a date?	When I was younger I would meet girls online and tell them to meet me outside their house at a specific time. If they were ugly I'd keep driving. Pulled this one about 10 times. 7 were keep driving, 1 I married.	My girlfriend was on a date when I walked into a bar on Christmas. She bailed. I got very very drunk.
Do you feel like you have ever been accurately represented in media, and if so, what show/movie got it right and how?	The new Ghostbusters is the first time I truly understood what representation feels like. I got to see a summer blockbuster with 4 complete women who were awesome, smart, funny, unsure, overcame adversity, worked together, ate, weren't sexualized, and didn't involve a man. They felt authentic in a way my friends do. It was a truly wonderful moment that I wasn't entirely prepared for. I spent most of the second half of the movie silently weeping. It was like not realizing how bad the pain was until it stopped. I've been able to identify with plenty of characters before (and I've spent my whole life learning how to identify with men) but this was a first for me. I honestly didn't know I could feel like that.	As a teenager I was really happy Daria existed. I was angsty and frumpy and so many teenage role models were pretty and fashionable and popular. Daria was a reminder that there isn't one mold in society.
Are you the kind of person to get the same thing every time you go to a restaurant because you've had it before and know it's good, or do you get something different so you aren't missing out on something better?	I have very limited tastes, so I tend to get the same few dishes at restaurants. Chicken fingers, spaghetti, Alfredo, quesadillas, etc. I'm not a very adventurous eater since in so picky. That being said, I can always find at least one thing on a menu that I can eat, so if I get taken somewhere that I don't like, such as perhaps a sushi restaurant, I'm sure they would have a dish of rice or something.	If I'm trying a new restaurant I'll order a "canary in the coal mine" type dish to see if the restaurant itself is any good - lasagna at an Italian restaurant, General Tso's at a Chinese restaurant, a burger at an American restaurant, that kind of thing. If it's good and I go back, I'll branch out.
Straight men who are questioned to be gay, how does it make you feel?	I was always flattered; as I likened it to being told I'm optimistic, fashionable, and fun to be around. Turns out it's just because I suck.	When I was growing up I was socially awkward as fuck and grew up in a really religious home so I was always super respectful of girls and boundaries so when I started overhearing some girls insinuating that I might be gay it didn't feel too good.
Women who don't fit the Eurocentric beauty standard, how is your self esteem regarding your appearance?	Im a guy and i have the typical male beauty standards. I look good but i mean i can go somewhere and see like 20 guys who look just like me. Some of the most beautiful women iv ever seen dont have that euro look. You dont have to in order to be even good looking.	It's great! Approximately zero percent of my self-worth is tied into my genetic appearance. My middle eastern family members are always talking about how to be lighter/skinnier/more white "passing" but I find that to be a concern more for the older generations who risked social isolation/oppression because of their appearance. I'm pretty priveleged to live in a place that generally celebrates differences instead of penalizes them.
What do wish you could tell your 20 year old self?	"Don't be a wuss, get a dealer and learn to roll." Granted I'm still 20. I might be glad for this later in life.	You WILL gain a shit ton of weight from all the beer and fast food you consume. You DO NOT have a "really good metabolism".
Why aren't adult stores more men-friendly?	Female sexuality is seen as a right, natural, and beautiful. Male sexuality is seen as perverted and vile. Thus the sex toy market that uses open shops (as opposed to internet) will be geared towards women, and it will be women working there.	If you're going to judge someone for being a pervert while you work at an adult store then you need to get your head checked.
Is society failing boys and young men?	Early 20's here, welll adjusted, in a stable and happy relationship, generating a good career. Society isn't failing young men. Young men and boys are failing themselves, but this isn't news. Young men have been failing since we were hunter gatherers. It's the whole point of men as a gender, we have to compete amongst ourselves because a fraction of us are going to get left behind in the genetic tide. The difference now is that the guys that would have just been pushed to the edges of society have a number of different forums to ask for help and improve themselves and their standing. You don't ever see posts saying: "Guys, I row crew, have a hot girlfriend and made it into Yale! Help?!" because they don't need to post. They made it already, you'll just never read about it online.	We didn't have the option to go online and ask all these questions. We had to nut up or shut up. If I'd had the resources that are available now, I would've used 'em. I'd be on reddit going 'What's the difference between head and a blow job?' and I'd probably get a better answer than the one I got in grade 5. Which was 'Head is like a blow job but better.' *nodding* 'Ok'
Why do so many men hate high waisted jeans on women?	*a wild feminist appears* What if I told you not everything women do has to be met with men's approval? I like high waisted styles and I'ma keep doing me. Edit: Waiting for all the downvotes, but I regret nothing.	It takes a very specific body type to look good in them, and that body type would look so much better in almost anything else.
Girlfriend has depression; should this be a red flag? Can we still live a happy and good life?	It's not a red flag if she's treating it herself. If I were giving her advice I would tell her to dump you based on this post. Not to be a dick, but you seem to lack in emotional intelligence and you won't be able to give her what she needs if you're still this dependent on your parents.	Female here, dating depressed male. I could give you oodles of examples on why it is worth trying, but my main advice is this: there is no "happy ever after" with anyone, in the sense of everything going smoothly, rosy skies, birds singing to wake you up. Every person you will meet, will have some kind of issue/bagage. You have found someone who is not only aware of her issue, but is working on it. In my opinion, if you want to make it work, it will work.
In the spirit of Halloween, what is the scariest experience you have ever had?	In the 30th trimester my mother after a particularly long arduous day at work came home to inform me that I was about to be aborted. I've gone swimming with a flotation device holding me under water before, I've been hiking and seen a baby bear about 50 meters away. These are probably a lot more dangerous, but even so.	The one night i was so tired that i slept with the door open and had my first encounter with sleep paralysis that night. 2 for 1 baby
For first-time dating, would you use an app where you just remove the pics of people that you don't want to meet, then out of the remaining you get a date within 45 minutes, at a bar close-by?	To me writing and texting hurt every inch of my body and I feel that the information gained by doing so is 0. I basically never date online because other girls want to write for weeks before meeting. I prefer that their profile answer the questions I have. I prefer to just meet as quick as possible. That is why I go out and meet people for real.	I would not meet up with someone purely based on pictures, and not within an hour of hearing about their existence. I also wouldn't meet at a bar I had no choice in, the ones closest to me are sketchy as fuck.
What's your favorite part of Disney's "Mulan"?	Dude fuck Mulan. I had nightmares for months after seeing that movie. They make the Huns way too scary man.	The juxtaposition between the ending of "A girl worth fighting for" and seeing the razed village with the doll. Chills.
TIFU by biting a girl in the vag. Any advice?	So why exactly CAN'T you apologize for hurting her and then let her know that this was it and you are not interested in her anymore? You make it all sound like she tortured you, but you chose to go down on her and then it went awkward. Just man up and deal with the results.	Abort mission. Register everyone as KIA. Change your name to Paco and head to Costa Rica to start a new life as a goat herd. It's really your only play.
Is it shallow to lose attraction to a girl after finding out what she looks like without makeup?	No. Women cake so much makeup on their face and look like a completely different person and then get mad when you're not attracted to their natural face, a face you've never seen before.	Yes, but all of these things from other comments: > you like what you like. You shouldn't be harassed over that. > You're attracted to what you're attracted to. Plus, the differences can be big enough that even if they're attractive without makeup, it could look odd compared to what you're used to and still turn you off which is completely understandable. > You can't control who you're attracted to, and many women use makeup to hide the fact that they are not attractive > Can't help what you like. > You're allowed to decide for yourself (or more accurately, let your instincts decide for you) what you do and do not find attractive.You don't have to justify it to anyone. are still true.
Is it just me, or is any other Lady out there annoyed with men doing the whole "demand" or "beck-and-call" style dating behavior?	Ok, maybe it's only me, but most of the girls I'm involved with know that I'm only joking when I say stuff like that. Like I will first ask "Are you busy? Wanna come over and hang/go out tonight?" and if she says "No, I'm busy with dinner with my family" or w/e I'll joke around and say the whole "nah, ditch dinner with your fam." I only use this if I know the person and she knows me, cause I say stuff like that all the time but never seriously. I can't imagine people actually saying rude shit like that seriously.	I think that there is a fine line with this. If you already have a built familiarity with the other person, I don't see a problem. It could seem more enthusiastic and fun to just say "get in loser, we're going shopping!" However, if someone I barely knew or had just met came up to me and said something along the lines of "We are going on a date Friday. Be there at 8." without really establishing that you're someone I'd want to spend time with.... Well, that's not very cool.
Ladies in an interracial relationship, are there certain realities of your life or perspectives you have that your partner will never be able to understand? Moreover, if there are, can you make it work with that barrier?	Boyfriend is black and I'm white. Pregnant with his baby right now. Had no issues in any sense regarding racism so far. Hoping it stays that way. No issues with culture either as we were raised in the same place with the same culture. Everyone loves him as do I. Best relationship I've been in. Dated an Indian and Chinese guy and had huge amounts of issues with both them being disgustingly racist, racism towards them and cultural differences. Chinese culture was the worst for me as women are viewed as submissive scum. Never again will I put myself in that fire.	Standards of beauty. I recently went natural/big chopped all my chemically straightened hair. My white husband wasn't the most supportive at first (I've had long, relaxed hair almost my whole life--so this was a big adjustment, even for me). It took him some time, but he now loves my hair.
How do you get attractive photos of yourself?	To get an attractive photo, follow these steps: 1: Be attractive 2: Don't be unattractive 3: Take a photo with you in it. You now have an attractive photo of yourself. If you're unattractive (which is essentially a antonym for photogenic) you're shit out of luck. But most people are, so its ok.	The only good pictures of me are when I'm laughing or extremely disheveled from a long day where I stayed awake way too long and not smiling. For me, just flat out smiling makes me look like I had an arrangement with the pavement.
How would you approach someone who is "too attractive"?	>Is it possible for someone to be too attractive/hot/beautiful to be hit on or talked to? Yes. >If so, how would you approach someone like that? I wouldn't.	I tell myself daily that I may not be getting hit on because possibly I'm too attractive that I'm intimidating.... That must be it. Right?!?

What's your opinion on bumble and the fact that women have to message men first?	Honestly, super appealing at first as a woman. Now, ugh, it’s terrible. What is the point of both of us matching, me reaching out with a witty opener, and then 24 hours goes by without a response from the guy so we get unmatched? I hate the 24 hour response time. Edit: love that I answer the question (I hate the 24 hour window) and get downvoted into oblivion. 🤷🏼‍♀️	I have a sentence in my bio saying to start by telling me their favorite conspiracy theory. The chick ignored that completely, said only hey, then changed her tinder bio (matched on both) to include "tell me your favorite conspiracy theory".
What is your opinion on people who use the terms, wifey, hubby, and fur-baby ?	Whatever floats their boat about the first two. Fur baby. .. as long as they don't legitimately think it's comparable to a real baby in difficulty and whatnot. It's not. So not. Omg not.	Don't like them in particular, but not offended by them. I do hate, however, stuff like DH, DS, DD. Stop.
What are some simple, relatively harmless actions or behaviors that fill you with rage?	Driving slow with a line behind you. Yeah, you might technically be doing the speed limit, but at the same time it's completely obvious that everyone behind you wants to go faster. They probably have places to be, shit to do. If you don't have any stuff to do, that's cool, but have some fucking courtesy - pull over, let people pass, and then continue on your slow-ass way. Stop holding up an entire group of people just because you don't personally feel like going faster. Also: driving in the left lane without passing. Knock that shit off.	* People who chew with their mouths open when they eat * People who blast music, phone calls or videos through their phone speakers in a public setting. Same with games. * People who get distracted on the phone (or distracted/space out in general) when you're talking to them, then go, "Huh?" and ask you to repeat yourself after you're finished talking. Pay attention, idiot! * People who don't let you through onto traffic/blocking traffic if you're trying to cut through or turning onto traffic. (If that makes sense.) Also, people who don't move over a lane on the highway when people are trying to merge.
Women who are or used to be the "I'm not like the other girls/girls are too much drama" types, what motivated that attitude and what made it change?	I think the most common answer would be that women who get hurt by women just want to write them off all together. I understand that. I find almost all females to be annoying, selfish, and ultimately boring. With guys, they are annoying, oblivious, and less boring to me. A female friend wouldn't hike with me, wouldn't do daring things with me and would be judging me and everyone around us. A male friend wouldn't give a shit about anything and more often than not judge me or others people less harshly than a woman. I guess I/we don't want to deal with being judged by other women.	I didn't know a ton of other women and I didn't get along that well with the ones that I did know. So I assumed it was a women problem, not a compatibility problem with a small number of people. I went to college and met a lot of ladies who are a lot like me.
What was your worst experience meeting your girlfriend's family?	One of my exes and were both bisexual and her parents were thrilled because there are some horror stories about some types of straight men. Well, she had a psychotic younger sister who wasn't pretty and it's obvious. Well, she was "going to expose his secret gay affair". She'd make a point to have one or more with these rude gay guys with her. One day, I just said, "those nonsense theories won't help you blame my existence for you being single. If your own men don't want you, don't be blaming us." BOOM. I would catch her scurry past a few times. She's brought up bi men in situations with friends. "The 'official story' is that women don't want them but it's a sham! You've gotta be a lesbo for them to think you are hot too."	Her family made Chinese food in an attempt to help me feel at home when I had dinner with them the first time. It was a really sweet gesture, but it was rather misguided. Apparently I was the first Asian guy their daughter had ever brought home, so they didn't know how to host me. I actually find the experience really amusing; my girlfriend at the time was mortified.
Do guys keep nudes of their exes?	I can't imagine why it would be difficult for a girl to understand why a guy might want to keep pictures of beautiful naked girls.	I don't keep them in a special nude box but I don't delete them when I'm backing up all my pictures on my external hard drive. This might seem weird but I kind of want to keep everything, even the very personal stuff, for when I'll be older. I like the idea of having this "folder/box of personal history" that I'll look someday remembering the days of when I was young.
What's the most unrealistic thing (advice, story, etc) you've read on AskMen?	There is a frightening number of people who seem to think placating or appeasing women into somehow being attracted to you is a valid dating strategy. The general advice that boils down to "be less masculine" that constantly gets thrown around here is incredibly misguided. Hell, there's already three comments in this thread alone that fit the criteria of bullshit I just listed. AskMen can get weirdly anti-male at times. And of course the whiteknight downvotes proving my point. Don't worry guys, if you prostrate yourself enough she can't help but get wet for you!	"Oh, your state has a stupid law/unreasonable politician/bad school? Move to a different state." Thanks genius. I'll say goodbye to all my friends and family, quit my job and list my house right away.
If you're happy with someone but you don't think that they're "the one", is it wrong to stay with them?	"The one" is a silly and stupid unrealistic concept. It's just unfair to evaluate whether your partner is the one or not, especially when you are happy with that person. Some would even go so far to say that one who has thoughts like this doesn't deserve the partner they are currently happy with.	I think it is wrong to mislead them and make them think that they are 'the one' for you if you don't think that is the case, but I don't see any problem with continuing the relationship if you are totally honest and upfront about that and they make their own choice about it. I, personally, wouldn't stay with someone if I knew that they didn't see a future with me or if I knew that I didn't see a future with them, but other people may handle things differently.
Those of you that stopped actively looking for a girlfriend and decided to just have fun and commit to self-improvement, how did that go?	You wanna know what happened? I got a girlfriend. The second you stop worrying about stuff like that and simply love yourself and become the best version of yourself that you can, good things will come your way.	I have lost 40 plus pounds, my running had improved greatly and I am making strides in overcoming PTSD and have relearned how to be the source of my own happiness and while I am often okay with solitude I also have no friends and sometimes feel so alone that it physically hurts
What is the most selfish and/or unrealistic thing you want in a relationship?	I think the most unrealistic thing I am looking for in a relationship is just to have someone who accepts me and my interests 100% for who I am and what they are. I'm a nerd who loves purple and sparkles but also has a fascination with dark morbid stuff. I play video games, listen to classical, k-pop and death punk and I want a man who can handle that. They don't have to enjoy all those things too but I don't want to have to give anything I like up just because my SO doesn't have an interest in it. I'm sure some people have that in their relationships but I've yet to find it.	I need a lot of "me" time. I love writing and watching shows alone. I need some of this every day or I get sullen.
What was your most recent frustration with a woman?	I know this is actually the opposite of what should be said in this thread. But I can't remember my last frustration with a woman. My girlfriend is pretty amazing :)	Ugh. She liked me enough to let me catch her if I chased hard enough, but not so much that she'd do any of the moving herself. Fuck that noise. It sucks, because she was cool as hell. Fun to hang out with. But I can't be the one doing everything all the time, you know?
What NSFW female lifestyle hack can you share?	Pussy soap is the best thing in the world for general body odor. I live in a hot and wet country, so it's easy to smell bad. Bad smell on your armpits? Put some pussy soap in your hand and scrub! (though waxing helps me with the smell). For feet it isn't that good, at least for me, so for feet instead use listerine with water and soak your feet for a while. Edit: forgot to mention to use the neutral yellow listerine. The ones with color will probably dye your feet.	When breastfeeding menstral pads are 10 times more effective to use as breast pads to avoid leaking, and 1/10th of the price! Just cut them in half to fit better in your bra
Those who grew up in poverty, what obstacles did you face and were you able to make a better life for yourself?	Budgeting. I am shit with money and spend it on shitty thing like bad food and booze/smokes. It's hard to break that habit.	A lot of things just take a longer time. I took 6 years to finish undergrad for example because i was working 40-60 hours a week in the beginning of it which really screwed my gpa the first few semesters. I also never made a lot of friends in those years because i would go to work right after class and i would have to turn down their offers to join them every time.
What drugs have you tried recreationally?	When I went to festivals I tried my fair share, though I was really careful where I got them and from who, also how much I did. I've tried: Mushrooms, Ecstacy, MDMA/MDA, LSD, Mushrooms, Ketamine, Salvia, weed. I want to try DMT if I meet someone I really trust. I tried some designer drugs once, 2CB I believe. It really just felt like mushrooms with a bad crash afterward. Personally, I don't really do much anymore, sometimes mushrooms during the summer. I made a point never to do anything up my nose or things I felt could be addictive.	Weed, MDMA, psilocybin (shrooms), LSD, cocaine. I've enjoyed them all and take great care to only use them on rare occasions, particularly cocaine (it just disappears so easily...). It hasn't been a problem for my SO and I. Having said that, it's absolutely not for everyone.
What song or lyric makes you sad every time you hear it?	Montreal by The Weeknd is probably my pick, helps that it's my favourite song though. "Happiness exists when you don't know a thing", "Girl you could have had me doing anything you pleased" and "You probably could have had it all, you could have been that lonely star if we just went on" are probably my picks	I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky -- Pearl Jam You are forever in my heart you never died You are forever I still wonder where you are -- Nevermore
Why does depression seem to be a common and almost boasted thing?	When you 'have' depression and/or anxiety it gives you a blank slate to be as much of a minging little twat as you want and nobody says anything. It's basically a way to absolve yourself of all responsibility. "Sorry I didn't pick you up at the airport, I was having an anxiety attack" "sorry I skipped out date, I was depressed and decided to play vidya for five hours" Of course the vast majority of these 'depressed people' have never been diagnosed or been treated for it. Basically an untouchable free pass to be a spoiled little shit.	Depression is a serious issue, but I think there are people who self-diagnose and use it as an excuse against doing things they don't like.
Men who had/have crushes on a close friend, what happened?	One of 3 things will *always* happen: * They'll agree and you go on a date / start to date * They'll say no and the friendship ends * They'll say no, you try to remain friends, but it eventually fails or is nowhere near the same level of friendship it once was	I asked her out and she told me she wasn't interested in me that way. We're still friends, but no where near as close as we used to be. Which sounds crappy, but it's actually good for me. I'm not breaking my back trying to please her anymore and I don't have to pine after her anymore.
What tiny, stupid life struggle do you sometimes face?	I am left-handed and the Metrocard readers in the NYC subway are right-handed. I frequently spend a stupid amount of time trying to 1. awkwardly use my left hand to swipe my Metrocard or 2. repeatedly use my right hand to swipe my Metrocard at an incorrect speed, getting the "please swipe card at this turnstile" message and becoming increasingly flustered by the irritated commuters behind me.	When I'm trying to put a jacket on and I realise that the 2nd arm is inside out, so I spend the next minute or so jabbing at it trying to stick my arm through the sleeve without having to take the jacket off to fix it.
How do you feel about dirty talk during?	Obviously not as stimulating for males as it is for females in general. For the most part I just stick to basic commands and descriptions of things, or "..ya like that?" kind of talk.	Love it. It can be tricky not to be repetitive though. It's almost like I need a "dirty thesaurus" next to my bed.
How did you wake up today?	i woke up after three hours of sleep to go feed animals at work, then returned home to take care of my dog who was attacked by the neighbor's dog yesterday. i'd much rather have a baby spider infestation and dive bombing wasps.	Oh goodness that sounds awful! I woke up next to the new guy I've been seeing. He told me that in my sleep I grabbed his dick. When he tried to turn over/pull away, I turned with him to maintain my hold. I'm embarrassed but also proud that sleeping me for never letting go of what I wanted.... Never let go of your dreams.
What is something that you cannot understand, no matter how open minded you try to be?	Being that guy. I don't get how people are unwilling to try drugs just once in their life. Consciousness is one of the biggest mysteries of our existence, and you can alter it in very odd ways. I guess I get being afraid of addiction as a reason. But drugs are one of the most unique experiences you can have and many people just refuse to even consider being a little open minded about them.	People that lie about everything. I worked with a guy shortly after highschool who was clearly not athletic, yet he tells me he was on the varsity football team, and the varsity baseball team, and he banged probably 50 girls in senior year alone. Do these people not know that nobody believes them? What satisfaction do they get from spewing lies about stuff that nobody really cares about In the first place?
How put off would you be if you were talking to a girl for ages, you two clicked, and you were really interested, but she eventually revealed she was hearing impaired?	Not sure about Australia but any Americans in this thread should know that here the proper term is hard of hearing, not hearing impaired. Some don't mind it, but others harshly reject the term. :)	If it was so unnoticeable that you had to reveal to me that you were impaired for me to know, then it really doesn't matter to me at all.
Men, do your female friends become really 'jealous' when you show interest in a woman?	Female perspective here: something like that happening could be one of two situations. 1....they either care about you now or cared about you in the past, ROMANTICALLY, and are comparing themselves to her. They probably don't realize they're doing this. But they are. So they're definitely going to be vocal about all that crap. It's a pacifier. 2....they don't care about you romantically, but they truly do care about you a LOT...and they're the judgmental type to begin with.	Sometimes, which doesn't make sense to me, because my female friends either have a boyfriend, or we've had romantic feelings and I expressed mine, and they said they only see me as a friend. I mean if you only see me as a friend, then why are you getting butthurt when I mention a girl I'm talking to atm?
All these 'red flag' questions are so negative! Would any women of reddit like to share a story where the date went a lot better than expected?	I didn't really date, I just slept with people. My now husband took me on a date and we had sushi and it was so fun to share that experience! I never had sushi and sake before! Obviously it went well because we are now married with three kids!	Want to know the truth? I've had some awkward and mediocre first dates that showed that even when there's no chemistry people can still be good. Like the guy I met who was so nice, but not what I was looking for at all. He asked if he could hug me, I said yes. We talked later and both agreed that there was no chemistry. And that was it. No weirdness. He was a good guy.
What was the most vulnerable an SO has ever been in front of you and how did you comfort them?	I wonder why there are no stories about a guy being vulnerable and then a woman losing attraction in this subreddit/thread. Hmm. Could it be that women are wonderful?	He cried hard when his dog died last summer. I held him, stroked his hair, and cried with him. Then I encouraged him to have a little memorial service since I read an article once about how pet deaths can be hard because we don't deem it as societally-acceptable to grieve for them, even if they feel like family. I didn't want him to bottle it up, so we had a little vigil where he told me stories about his dog and we honored her memory.
Why do you think teen girl culture is hated so vehemently?	Because it's terrible? Everything is superficial and shallow and so many people act like cookie cutters of one another if it's what's popular. Follow this trend, follow that trend. Being dumb for a laugh is the "in" thing 90% of the time, and what's not to hate about that?	There's this expectation for girls to be mature adults ASAP, and teenage girls having interests that are just for fun undermines that. It points out that they actually are still children, just as much as their male counterparts.
Men: Can you really think about nothing?	Yes. It happens quite a bit, I used to meditate a lot so im even capable of detaching myself from the thoughts and "watching" them drift by.	Actually yes. Not on command so much. But if I'm doing something like watching a movie I'm generally a blank. Sometimes I'm trying to figure out a plot twist. But usually I'm just soaking up sensory input with very little conscious interruption.
What is your unpopular opinion about men?	They think that reading a few articles on feminism makes them more of an expert on it than actual literal women.	A lot of men get competitive to the point of it being really petty. Like silly power plays for no reason type stuff.
Girls who thought they'd be alone forever: what's your success story?	I'm sorry you feel that way. From a guys perspective. If you work on yourself and make your own life fulfilling and exciting without a partner. You have a better change of attracting one. A quality one that shares your interests.	I stopped caring about finding someone, learned to ride, bought a sportbike (2003 Yamaha R6) and met a great group of friends with common interests and all roughly similar ages. Ended up meeting my current SO through friends and we just celebrated 9 years together.
What's the best compliment you've ever received from the opposite sex?	I just got, "you have the biggest dick I've ever seen, no really just looking at it makes me wet." she waited till she moved two states to say that....but you know still nice to hear.	“I'd say that you were the 5th most attractive guy in class.” — said by a girl in college. The class comprised of 12 students. :(
What is the most mortifying thing you ever did?	At least you can pass that off as a joke, OP! Haha I've done so many mortifying things. Welcome to mild social anxiety.	When I was in 2nd grade I used to think that if I cover my nose with my hand then nobody would know I was picking it. They knew. :(
I’m wanting to get better at talking to people. How do you hang out at bars on your own?	Don’t. If you have interests find other people in that community through meetups or through stores that cater to your hobbies. That’s the best way. Bars are probably not the answer.	Traveling makes it hard to form a good social circle, so props on giving it a try. My recommendations would be sit at the bar and introduce yourself to the bartender. Explaining your situation, (I'm traveling for work, had to get out of that hotel room, etc) will at least strike up a 3-5 min conversation and plant a seed for more talking throughout the night. If you travel to the same place frequently, make it a point to return to the same place and remember the staff members. If people come to the bar to place rink orders, a simple 'Hey, how's your night going?' will at least illicit a response, and repeating it will increase your chances of actual conversation.
What websites do you use to obtain unbiased facts about politics?	All my news sources are left-leaning. All of the respectable ones are. The only right-leaning news is Fox News and they're ridiculous. If there was a decent right-leaning news outlet I would read it because balance is important. Oh well...	I don't think there are truly unbiased sources. I haven't met many people that don't have strong opinions on anything and since people write articles..... Personally I use The Washington Post, BBC, NPR, and The Hill. My SO reads more conservative sources to get an idea where they are coming from and tells me about it because I don't have enough patience to do that myself. [This is generally a good guide to news sources](https://walterkilar.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/wp-1485299374802.png)
People of AskWomen, what advice would you give to a couple about to live together?	MAKE SURE HE DOES HIS FAIR SHARE! So many men think that once they have a woman in the house tthey can just slack off on all the chores. Do not stand for this. Do not give in and take care of it "just this once." It will become a pattern for your life. You've already established ground rules, now just make sure you stick to them! And make sure to keep some money and maybe a bag of clothes and stuff squirreled away somewhere he doesn't know about. Not saying you have reason to be worried but if things go south you don't want to be stuck there because youre broke or don't have a way to leave easily.	Decide how you will pay household bills. Maybe open a joint bank account just for household expenses and each of you deposit enough to pay for rent, utilities, and saving for household emergencies each month. It's not romantic, but it is important that each of you have a clear understanding and agreement regarding your finances.
Divorced women: looking back, what were some red flags you ignored while dating/the first couple years of marriage that ultimately ended up being a crucial mistake?	This is going to hurt. His passcode was his child’s mother’s name. And guess what I still married that dumb fucker. Divorced 5 months later.	He was not very patient or understanding. E.g. yelled at me for something petty on our wedding day. Yelled at me the first week after I gave birth to our son even though he was sleeping all night while I was up every 2 hours. Never got up overnight to change diapers. Was just generally mean sometimes. Sadly I wasnt the one to ask for a divorce. Spent money on big ticket items he didnt need. even though When consulting me I said please dont do it. When I told him I was finding this unacceptable and we needed to go to counseling (mainly the name calling) he asked for a divorce a week or so later.
Who is the most charming person you've ever met and how would you describe him/her?	They make eye contact, they don't stutter when they speak, they use your name frequently in sentences, and they make you feel safe. Some feel that it's more of an outgoing characteristic- but personally, that can go to greasy used-car-salesman really fast.	My best friend from high school is absolutely charming. She is very outgoing, friendly, bubbly, funny and very beautiful. She can have a conversation with anyone and makes friends with just about everyone she meets. I think a lot of people associate the word "charming" with *superficial* charm, but I can say with certainty that there is nothing superficial about this girl, at all, she is just legitimately a good and friendly person down to her core. She's just also a magnetic personality that a lot of people want to be around. And I swear, she gets so many jobs she's not actually qualified for, just cause she's so damn likable.
Men who have been mid-shit when the fire alarm went off at work, what did you do?	Oh for fuck.. Everyone has a fire alarm go of in their work. Why the fuck does it have to be "men"? Yeah, I guided people out but it was my dudy and I'm 100% sure my female employees could have done the same. This sounds sexist as fuck!	Texted a coworker and asked him what the shit was going on. "Hey, is that the fire alarm going off?" "Yeah" "Is it a simulation?" "I don't know man I am taking a shit on the third floor" "Well, looks like we're both fucked" "Yeah"
If you could pick one girl/woman (alive or dead, real or fictional) to be your BFF, who would it be?	Hillary Clinton. She's had so much shit thrown at her over the years and she doesn't even break a sweat. I want to be like that.	Leslie Knope from Parks and Recreation! She's smart, funny, and values friendship above all. That show will always put me in a good mood.
What types of “Red Flags” do you see in yourself, and how do you go about mitigating them?	I’m super insecure and quite clingy, (although far from controlling). I do a lot of therapy and considering that most of my insecurity comes from being male, that’s getting less as I start to more openly transition.	I have a hard time communicating how I feel and tend to blow up on people when they think things are fine. It stems from wanting to please people being afraid of alienating others through confrontation. As I get older I’m becoming more comfortable with being candid about my feelings.
What is a (Harsh) truth about an ex you found out during or after the relationship?	That she was a massive introvert and wasn't going to change. We had very similar senses of humor, we had similar interests, and I thought she was incredibly attractive, but she was also immensely shy and quiet around people she didn't know. I kind of hoped that if I took her out more, she might come out of her shell, but after almost a year, I figured out that that was not going to happen.	Textbook Alcoholism. We were together short of 6 months and we never actually had full on PIV because she was always too drunk and I didn't want to "dead fish" my GF. Granted I was in college and bartending at the time, so it's not like I was some kind of saint, but yeah, she was off the tracks. Also, one time when she was wasted she blurted out "I used to be chunky, but I smoked meth for about 18 months and I lost a bunch of weight and but got to keep these big tits".
What things have men you've dated said that has revealed a grave lack of knowledge about the female anatomy?	Asking if giving a blowjob brings a woman pleasure... uh... seriously? Stick a banana down YOUR throat and tell me how *great* that feels!	I wish I knew the /u/ to give her props, but the best answer I've ever seen to this question was from a woman whose boyfriend was happily jiggling her boobs around and asked in all innocence, "Won't all this milk go bad?"
What was the worst financial mistake you have ever made?	I've never had a credit card. I honestly don't trust myself with one. I only pay with debit or cash. I'm pissed that it's expected of me to pay for things I can't currently afford and that I'm somehow weird for only wanting to live within my means. I imagine I'll get one at some point, but today is not that day.	I took my dream job and a big pay cut. It was a really long commute and long hours but I loved it. After 6 months though it was clear that my finances were in the toilet. I'd lost all my savings and was struggling to have enough to eat every month. I had to quit and go back to freelancing. Took 2 years to build it all back up, and I really miss the dream job. But I'm much less stressed now.
Guys, when did you tell the truth but live to regret it?	My manager gave everyone in our team little knick-knacks for christmas that her grandma made by hand. Some knitted, decorative something. I don't care for anything non-functional, so I promptly threw mine into the trash 3 minutes later. It came out, but seemed like no big deal, then I received a "performance improvement plan" out of the blue like a week later, which had ridiculous numbers in it. Coupled with my manager's subjective evaluation (imagine the praise), this led to me being fired. Yeah, fuck that woman.	Back in college a buddy and I told our friend (the three of us were roommates) that his girlfriend was cheating on him. We went back and forth quite a bit on whether or not to tell him, but in the end we both decided we would want to be told. After we broke the news he thanked us for tell him, but from that point forward there was always some sort of rift between us. Within 6 months he moved out and neither of us have spoke to him in years (even though we've both tried several times). We found out through some other friends that he is marrying her. :/ Poor guy. We just want our friend back
I refuse to date women that expect continual use of condoms in a long term relationship. Is that an unfair condition to place on a relationship?	I'm with you on this, i've only had sex with my ex-gf of 3,5 years together, she was on pills as soon as we started having sex and as far as the risk of pregnancy, we had no problem. Just one brief scare when she thought she had missed taking the pill one day, but it turned out she had taken it, just kinda slipped her mind. For a longterm relationship, I also feel birth control over condoms is the way to go, for sure. At the moment it's not really up to me but if I could do it myself, I definately would.	That's fine, but be prepared for potential consequences. I can't be on hormonal birth control. My ex hated condoms so I decided to try a 96% effective cervical cap AND spermicide gel and got pregnant.
Do you have any "forever alone" type female friends who are over 25? If so, what are the factors, honestly, that you think are holding them back?	Up until last year, it was me; I'm 32. I'm aware that I'm a bit scary looking, I'm on the autism spectrum, and I'm very smart and have a strong personality, and I do nothing to dim those things down in any way because I refuse to lie to anyone who wants to be my friend. I don't consider that any of this was "holding me back" - my singleness was a choice, just as my now togetherness is a choice, made of my own free will and for reasons I don't have to explain or justify to anyone. To have it suggested that I was somehow doing something to prevent my own happiness is a bit insulting, OP.	Not being honest with herself or guys about what she wants. She's 29 and wants to settle down, but she keeps meeting guys on Tinder and getting hurt when they want to keep things casual. I think she's trying to keep up with younger people in our graduate program and gets sucked into "hookup culture," even though that's not what she wants.
What occupations are often looked down upon but without them society would crumble?	Most of the skilled trades. No woman wants to date an electrician, but good luck building a house in a world where they don't exist.	Sanitation workers. Actually went on a date with a girl a couple of months back who said that they get paid too much money for "such an easy job". Made me lose respect for her right away since these guys are working shitty hours, in the cold, in the heat, in snow, rain, etc and they're breaking their backs. It's a very tough job.
As a male, what are the cons of getting married and having kids in your 30s/40s instead of your 20s?	You're over 50 before they're out of the house. Don't have kids if you consider yourself at all selfish. Don't have kids if your life sucks, because your kids' life will probably suck worse. Kids are a pain in the ass, expensive, a literal life-long commitment. There's a chance you'll get a retard or a gimp and you'll be stuck taking care of the kid like a baby for the rest of your life. Do you want to be 75 and changing the diaper of a 40 year old? Enjoy your life, there's no good reason to have a kid and there are plenty of reasons not to.	You'll leave them sooner. If you have a kid when you're 20, you'll be 40 when they're 20. If you have a kid when you're 40, you'll be 60 when they're 20.
What moment made you realize you're not okay?	First time I tripped acid and felt like I had seen everything in my past/present I wasn’t emotionally dealing with.	When I [M21] bought a $300 black revolver on my credit card, had in-n-out for my last meal, and hiked to my favorite view at 1am. I only put 4 rounds in it, in my version of “Russian roulette”, spun the drum, and pulled the trigger. I said I’d give the universe one chance to save me, and it did. Sometimes I regret not doing it anyways. That was 4 months ago. I’ve since quit my job and moved back in with my family. Started anti-depressants and talk therapy. I come from a family that doesn’t believe in doctors, so getting help has been hard. My mom said she doesn’t believe me, even though I gave my dad the gun for safe keeping. I didn’t tell them I pulled the trigger, just that I came really close to doing it.

What do you do for supplemental income (i.e. not your main job)?	If I do basic tech support stuff for my parents (help them with their iPhones, roku boxes, laptops), then they buy me stuff. It's a pretty good deal for me! Oh look, Apple just rolled out a new iOS update...looks like I'm getting a new pair of hiking boots!	Nude modeling. Three hours sitting around naked,which is all I really want to do anyway, and I get paid $60 at the end of it.
Does anyone else have beliefs that you know are rooted in sexism, but it's hard to get rid of them?	I think that women are bad drivers. I really want to be convinced otherwise, but every sinle time somebody blocks a pedestrian way, drives dangerously and recklessly close to me or doesn't check their surroundings while driving, it's a chick :(	I keep finding myself grumpy and insecure over my husband not wanting sex as much as I do, because clearly blah blah men want sex more than women blah blah. I know it's just a stereotype, but it's hard to kick it because it's so incredibly pervasive in conversation, media... just everywhere.
Men who are married, how much did you spend on the ring and wedding?	Yeah...we're poor, and seeing some of these comments makes me realize how poor we are =[ Her ring was $2200, it's a moissanite and palladium band, with a matching wedding band. No idea how expensive mine will be, hopefully cheap. Total on the wedding, as of today, was just under $10,000. We have private land to do it on, and both our families are well respected in the community so we got some deals. She bid on a 3 day 4 night Vegas trip at the Mule Deep Foubdation banquet, we got it for $220. A good family friend is thanking me for keeping his son sober by paying for our plane tickets, both ways first class	The engagement ring was one month's salary after taxes. The wedding was paid for by our four parents. The honeymoon was one month's salary after taxes.
What monthly subscription boxes do you use or highly recommend?	Man, the disappointment when you come in a thread hoping to find a cool box to buy your girlfriend (she doesn't wear make-up ever) or shaving boxes (she doesn't have body hair / waxes once a month).	I really like Dollar Shave Club. If you want a really nice razor it's probably not the way to go, but I like being able to get razor blades for $6 every two months straight to my doorstep. And the blades are better than anything I could ever find at a grocery/drug store without buying really expensive ones.
What are some things about office culture you wish you had known about before starting your job?	I work in retail and honestly it’s not that bad. The thing is though, you have to be mentally prepared for ANYTHING. Mostly it’s just the oddly dressed person, or a weird or funny comment. One time I had these two young boys come in and after a few minutes of browsing the candy shelf, one of them turns to the other and with a completely straight face says: “You’re too lazy to be alive.” I felt that. You felt that. The world felt that.	Don't buy new clothes for a new job unless or until you see the office. I got new dress pants and a couple of button up shirts and my grandmother bought me a suit. Everybody in the office was wearing jeans.
Do any of you ladies have a job that you enjoy so much, you actually look forward to going to work every day? If you really enjoy your job, what do you do?	I don't look forward to going to work every day. I'm tired a lot, and my job is high stress. But I *love* my job. I love the people I work with, and I love the intellectual challenges of daily activity.	I work at NASA and I train astronauts on biological experimentation techniques which they'll eventually use when they're on the ISS. Yay science! I love my job.
Women who married their SO early in life, how is your marriage currently?	I said falling in love not breaking up. Second, this is MY opinion based on MY own experience. OP asked a question to get opinions not to look for a right or wrong answer. Glad to hear you are happy based on the choices that YOU decided to make.	My husband and I were high school sweethearts. Started dating when I was 14 and he was 17...got married when I was 18 and he was 21...we’ll celebrate 32 years together this coming November. Our kids are grown now and we actually connect better now than ever. I think it’s because we’re older and realize how precious life is so we try not to take each other for granted. We talk about everything. If either of us has a problem or disagrees with the other, we make it a point to communicate rather than lose our tempers/jump to conclusions. I came from a really f**ked up childhood and my husband has been the most patient, loving man...I got very lucky! 🍀❤️
Think of the person you were MOST attracted to in your entire life. What ever happened to them?	She's across the country with her husband and kids and I'm stuck here with my wife who fell asleep on the couch (again) and hasn't touched me in months. I haven't chatted with her in about 3 hours and I hope she responds before I pass out because I want to fall asleep happy not just drunk.	I asked her to prom, she said yes, she gave me nonstop fuck-me eyes for two weeks, and then she got to know me.
My father cheated on my mother with a much younger woman so how do I explain to my brothers?	I do hope your entire family completely cuts off all contact with him. Cheaters do not deserve the affection produced by their children. I do hope you and your brothers begin to resent him. His everlasting punishment for his deeds will be never being allowed to talk to his own children. I can't think of a worse pain than to be excommunicated by your own kid.	> Heck, can't understand why my father would do such a thing... Key issue right there. Yet, you plan to explain it to your brothers. Sounds like you're not the right person to do this.
AskMen, have you ever gone to a massage parlor and received a "happy ending"? What was the experience like, and would you do it again?	I live in Southeast Asia...it's basically a weekly occurrence. Massages are cheap here and the happy ending is the cherry on top. Edit...OP asks if you have ever gotten one and what it's like. Answer the question. Get downvoted. Good talk guys. Edit 2...it was at -1 when I wrote the first edit	Yes and no, I wouldn't. Army buddies paid for it for me on my birthday overseas in Korea, I said 'why not'? The experience was a really weird mix, the girl was pretty much bored. I chalk it up to experience. Tried it, wasn't thrilled, didn't really enjoy contributing to the sex trade, and it lacked almost everything I enjoy about sex.
Have you ever fooled around or had sex with a guy friend? How did you relationship change?	I had this guy chase me all through high school. We became pretty inseparable and although I knew he probably had feelings I kinda ignored them and put him in the friend zone. However, even after high school he still clung on. After my first serious breakup, I decided to throw him a bone for all his years of faithfulness. I also knew it would be the kiss of death for our friendship. The sex was really good and it was exactly what I needed, a "friend" to help me move on from a really bad breakup, but he finally moved on too. I just think as a woman you should always be in charge and aware of the sexual environment. Like I totally KNEW once I gave him what he wanted for years, it'd be easy to get rid of him. Kinda fucked up, but I'm cold like that.	My current SO was my guy friend i fooled around with. We decided to be FWB, then "exclusive" FWB then said fuck it let's just get together.
On the flip side: What do you guys like to see in a woman's dating profile?	I actually kinda like it if she's a mother. There's something very vulnerable and nurturing about a woman caring for a child. It doesn't exactly eliminate "crazy" from the list of possibilities but it makes me feel like she's more grounded. Gives me that wholesome vibe.	*Message hooks.* If I'm going to spend the time to actually read your profile before sending you a message, you have to give me something to message you about. They could be anything. A funny anecdote. A cheesy joke. A charming detail. But whatever they are, a good profile has these interesting little tidbits that provide the subject matter for someone who is messaging you.
Who's the worst roommate you've had, and why were they awful?	A really nice girl from India who never cleaned up and would leave the kitchen a mess and the house smelling like Indian food all the time. She would wake up at 3am to start cooking and the process would continue most of the day. Took over the fridge and most cupboard space. Had an alter with food on it. House guests for weeks at a time. Also everything was vegetarian and didn't taste good to me personally so I would never eat anything and she would still make way too much then store it until it was rotting and still leave it long past rotting. I would clean the kitchen after work and wake up to another mess when I woke up, it was endless. She would not eat food she didn't cook so I could never go 24 hours without the Indian food problems.	She walked around butt naked all the time and we were the only two people living in our apartment and she would eat my food and then deny that she ate it
What is the closest you have ever been to dying?	New Year's Eve a couple years back. I was driving drunk on a dark, winding country road. I dozed off several times and would wake up to find I'd drifted into the opposite lane. Finally when I dozed off again I drifted onto some blocks that were lining the road and blew out both tires on that side. Luckily this happened right in front of my cousins and their friends who were hanging out by the side of the road. Most of whom happened to be mechanics. They replaced both tires in a matter of minutes and I made it home (now scared awake). Yea, I'm honestly surprised I lived through that night. I'm pretty sure there's multiple universes where I died in a horrific car accident.	I was working on my car in my driveway. It was only up on a jack which, apparently, was failing, unbeknownst to me. I was the only one outside at the time and the jack had been very slowly descending as I was under the car. The next thing I knew it was right on my chest, and still slowly descending. It was getting to be very difficult to breathe, and my vision was narrowing down to a very small circle. AT about this time my buddy (who has zero mechanical knowledge or ability) came out of the house. I somehow managed to communicate to him how to operate the jack. He got the car off of me just as my vision was down to a pinpoint. So... a few seconds from death. That's how close.
If Cosmo was written by people who knew what the hell they were talking about, what would you see on a "Top 10 ways to turn on your man" list?	1. Be hot, get naked. 2. Be hot, get halfway naked. 3. Be hot, get deep cleavage. 4. Be hot.	Number one on the list: make your man feel desired sexually. The biggest mistake women make is not understanding that the reciprocation of sexual attraction and desire is a very important to a man's mental health and well being in a relationship. Tons of women want to feel sexy and desired and fail to do the same to their men. Many people fail to practice common courtesy by not treating their partner the way they want to be treated in a relationship.
Does Facebook and/or Instagram depress you sometimes?	Nah. Maybe it's because I'm quite content with life right now, but if I see a bunch of people I know looking good or doing well I think, "Good for them!" not "Boo, I'm not good enough." I also enjoy the validation I get from lots of 'likes' or comments on a picture or status.	Yes, that's why I quit facebook. My life is pretty great, but I kept seeing other people do all these awesome things. Well it's different people so of course there's going to be a lot of awesome stories, but it made me feel my life wasn't as awesome. Although it actually was. When I got obsessed with likes, I quit. Very suddenly. Mom is still sad I left facebook.
Whats the luckiest sex youve ever had?	From about two days before the blizzard that blew through a few weeks ago to three days after, my girlfriend and I didn't see each other. When I was able to get dug out and go to her apartment afterwards, the first thing she did was yank me inside and then she dropped the towel she was wearing. Great sex ensued	Had a girl slide up into my DM's on IG, talked for a bit, she bought a plane ticket and flew interstate to spend a few nights with me then went home. Such a weird experience
How do you feel about Tennessee's new law that will criminalize women depending on their pregnancy outcomes?	My nephew was born 6 weeks early addicted to heroin and pain pills. She never faced jail time. He was taken away and given to her parents by the state. He was then given right back to her. My cousin finally got custody when he was 3. He couldn't walk and could not say more than one or two words. He had sores from being in a dirty diaper for so long that he spent three days in the hospital. If a mother uses illegal drugs while pregnant, I think they deserve years in prison. Anyone defending these people have probably never experienced what this shit is really like.	I think this is a symptom of the American Justice system trying to codify everything. We seem to treat making a law for something as the best solution, which is definitely not the case. It's the easiest to enforce, but ignores the larger societal problems that can only really be tackled with long-term change through education and reform.
What's the most ridiculous or laughable insult you've ever received?	Some guy called me a cunt. I'd read the book as a teen (the book by the title of Cunt), plus am not American, so the term has never been offensive to me (and thanks to the book, I know it used to be a word of respect). Up to that point things were getting very heated - as soon as he said that I started genuinely laughing, said thank you and have a good night, and walked away in a good mood while he was left flabbergasted.	Three weeks ago I was called looseleaf by a guy. I stood there, perplexed. Finally I asked him what the hell that was suppose to mean. He said, "Because you are white, you know, loose-leaf paper is white." I just died laughing 😂😂😂
When it comes to a career, what are some horrible mistakes guys in their 20s should avoid?	Always negotiate your pay when being offered a job. This goes for women too. Men generally negotiate their pay upfront and more often. It helps to explain at least a little of the pay gap between men and women.	Work to learn, not earn. Don't tolerate a shit boss, move on. Time is as important as money. Does your pay rise come with more work, so you're actually no better off. Does saving $50 a week on rent mean you have a 1 hour commute instead of 20 mins, plus more cost in transport. Under promise, over deliver.
How fast did you develop feelings for your SO ?	I met my current boyfriend right at the tail end of a shitty relationship with another guy. We were together and broke up and back together a lot. I really liked him (current SO) but was trying to salvage my relationship that was falling apart. He asked me out and it killed me when I had to tell him I had a boyfriend. He was from a different province, nothing like any guy I'd ever met before. I knew right away I wanted to know more about him. We were dating the next month. Very fast! I know. But we both fell so hard for each other. I know we're gonna get married and have babies together eventually. I guess when it's the right one you just know.	It only took one date. Towards the end of out first date I knew I'd marry him. It'll be 23 years in a few days.
Do you fight with your SO? Do you consider that unhealthy or normal?	Nope. I'm an adult and can express myself constructively rather than by being a jerk to my partner. I don't really understand the people who do fight. Longest relationship was 5 years or so and never fought like that. It does certainly seem to be normal to act like that, but as others have said, it certainly doesn't look productive from my perspective. Also, his entire mentality seems wrong, letting stress out and abusing my partner shouldn't be things that go together.	There is a very direct correlation between how hungry we are and how likely we are to fight. Usually we eat dinner and then realize that whatever we were bickering about isn't actually important.
How do you feel about homeschooling?	i love the idea of homeschooling! if i have children they will all be homeschooled. i would not take on this task myself, but hire a professional. i think i would also be sure to live in a neighborhood with many other families so my children wouldn't lack socialization. i would have them join local sports teams, girl/boy scouts, etc. i really like the idea of my children experiencing individual based learning. i think i was hindered in public school because i was afraid to ask questions in fear of looking dumb and i really struggled for a bit in college not knowing the basics. also the people i met who were homeschooled were much more advanced than other kids who were attending their public school.	I'm a public school teacher. I can COMPLETELY understand that there are tons of issues with public school these days, but there aren't many situations where I'd recommend home schooling.
Ladies, has a man ever gotten angry/hostile toward you after you've (politely) turned him down?	Yes. Constantly. Do you want a 'wider, more diverse group' to express their experiences or to express the answer you want? I read your post as 'i don't like/believe what the women on my facebook said, so i'll ask here to get a different response" Which is messed up. Accept what those women told you. I really hope I'm wrong and misreading this though. oh well.	Yes, at my bachelorette party. I refused all the drinks he brought me and then he got angry and shoved me when I refused him sex. I had the bride-to-be sash on and everything. He said I owed him sex for all the drinks he had bought, the bouncer literally threw him out of the bar. When we had to leave because the bar was closing (it was about an hour later), the bouncer also checked to make sure he wasn't just hanging out waiting for us.
When have you felt the least attractive?	When my 5'4 ex girlfriend told me I was too short (5'9) and she couldn't wear her favorite heels around me.	High school. Overweight, acne, bad hair do, no clothing sense. I was standing in the lunch line and we didn't tend to stand facing forward, we'd stand basically sideways, shoulder to shoulder. The girl in front of me was pretty and made me feel like i shouldn't look her way as to not come off as a creep or whatever so i was looking away. Then i felt like i could feel her looking at me so i turn and lock eyes with her and she just goes, "Uhg" and makes a face of being absolutely repulsed. That i think is the singular point i can point back to as to when physical insecurities began growing and the anxiety around girls started. I was like, 15. Other stuff happened as well, but i'd say that highschool girls are some of the most brutal people on the planet.
What was the most unwanted/unsolicited comment someone made to you?	"Ayyyy, big dude!" Yes giant scary biker guy at the gas station at 3am, I am a fairly large guy. Please go away now.	A bartender asked for my ID, then said, "that was a compliment, you're supposed to thank me.". I walked out.
When did you start to realize that some women actually found you attractive?	I knew Very early on in college. Dated the prettiest girls in my class, told by plenty of women that im attractive and I've never been rejected by a woman. Granted, some of that is how carefully I choose partners or fwb's. But i know for a fact its also because of how i look. Its a double-edged sword though because rejection is an experience EVERYONE should have in their life.	Around 21 I noticed girls looking at me. At first I was like, "Shit WTF am I doing?? Do I have a booger or something hanging from my nose, am I unconsciously leering at these woman? What am I doing wrong?!" It was only after I started becoming decently successful with woman that it dawned on me, "Oh, they're looking at me because I'm attractive." Also, did anyone else go through like a "second" puberty in their twenties? I was awkward and chubby all through my teens, but I filled out and developed muscles in my twenties. Now I'm 26, and I honestly think I look a lot better than I did at, say, 19.
I'm a Big Sister! Trying to find fun things to do with my Little, a 13 year old girl - any suggestions?	Is she girly? Are you? Cool girl stuff I totally would have wanted to learn at 13: * How to sew a dress * How to do a bunch of different braids * How to make those cool friendship bracelets with the beads and shit * How to apply makeup (cos maaaaakeovers & selfies!) * Various nail art techniques (dots, stripes, pictures, textures)	Could you cook a fun, healthy meal together? I don't know what your little's family's situation is but my mom mentors a high school student and they often go out for lunch—when they started and the student picked the location it would always be fast food places because that's what she was used to, but my mom's taken her to some more adventurous, healthy restaurants that the girl has really enjoyed. Cooking something could be an "activity" version of that maybe, and I feel like 13 is probably a good age for it.
What is the difference between your salary and your partner's? How does it affect your relationship if at all?	My fiance makes about double what I make. I'm super happy for him because he enjoys what he does. I felt the same about his job when he was making half that much. I will say that with a caveat though because if you're not married and the difference is huge, it could potentially cause problems. Not too long ago, I was a broke college student that could barely afford rent while he was already working successfully and making a decent salary. I felt badly often because he wanted to go out on dates and spending $20 to me was a big deal. He offered to pay always but it still didn't make me feel very good about myself.	The guy I'm seeing right now makes A LOT more money than I do, but also lives in a more expensive city so it's not as bad of a difference. He always wants to pay for things and most of the time doesn't let me pay him back or split it. I guess that's his choice but I feel like I'm taking advantage of his money, even though he says I'm not.
What are your thoughts on the growing number of reports suggesting that Ellen DeGeneres is actually kind of a horrible person?	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
What's one thing you never expected people to find attractive about you (but they do)?	My fucking face lips. Everyone, male or female, comments on my lips. Am I wearing lipstick? Am I wearing gloss? No. I've never in my life worn those and my lips look plain to me, but everyone raves about them. It annoys me for some reason.	I have a *huge* crooked nose. An older German lady stopped me once and told me that I had the most beautiful profile and that my nose was a gift. I had to hold back my laughter but I did thank her. I always thought it was the weirdest thing. I don't think she was lying either because she was this tiny older lady with a thick accent and she seemed really sweet. I've always been made fun of for my nose so for even one person out there to say it was beautiful was so very weird to me.
How do you know your attractiveness?	I feel confident in my appearance. Self-worth is key. Whether others decide to acknowledge my good taste or not is on them. :)	After having lost fat and packed on muscle and improved sense of style I'd say 1. Smiles from strangers instead of eye-rolls- both sexes 2. People are more likely to help me in all kinds of situations 3. I can be a gigantic prick sometimes and people tend to overlook it more 4. Lots more sex. 5. Lots more compliments
What do you think about the whole 'woman standing next to you in a bar wanting you to say hi' thing?	Every time it's some landwhale who thinks she's hot because drunk/pussy-hooked guys actually lower themselves to get some with her. I run when I see this happening.	It's counterproductive. If you're standing next to me in a crowded area but not talking or otherwise interacting with me, I'm just going to assume you're ... you know, standing there. Doubly so if you're turned away from me.
As a 16 year old kid still in highschool, what should I need to know about life and growing up?	1.Education is everything, disregard partying/females 2.Don't pick a loser career with no job opportunities/you will make minimum wage. Ex. Any social science, 99% of business degrees etc... If you're book smart/do well in school go into engineering of some sort. If you don't do well in school go into a trade. Be honest with yourself about your academic potential. 3. Start lifting weights as soon as possible. Being big/fit will do more for your self esteem/confidence/success with women/respect you get from men than practically anything else. subscribe to r/theredpill	You're never grown up, you never have it figured out, and you should never be still. You should be constantly learning and improving yourself, intellectually, physically, and emotionally. Make every day a day to be a better man.
What was it like the first time someone close to you died?	I was sad for about an hour because I wouldn't see them anymore. I then moved on. My family was appalled at my short lived feelings of loss.	Pretty awful. I shared a room with my grandma and I woke up with the sound of her calling me. I went to her bed and she whispered "I can't breath." I went to call my mom, as we got close to her again my mom said "quick call an ambulance" and my grandma replied "no I'll die on the way there." And she just passed away. It really got to me, I was 9 but I remember it so well.
What's your most awkward accidental penis touch story?	Gay thread where OP tries to humble brag about a huge Johnson that everyone just can’t help but grab. First story did not happen, second is embellished at best	A girl in my gym class was going for the ball in volleyball as I was going for it. She slammed my dick hard enough I almost blacked out. Felt worse than when I got stabbed ( which was also an accident).
What has your partner done that made you laugh your ass off? Or, what have you done that made your partner laugh their ass off?	Came home from work one day, and started to change clothes. My wife happens to be in the bedroom, gives a big happy seductive smile, and starts to quickly tear her clothes off as well. Still smile thinking of it. And the fun part after.	"Tomorrow I'm starting a diet, and doing yoga every day, and..... wasn't this pizza supposed to be a large? It feels like a medium."
What makes a woman long-term potential?	* Well adjusted with no mental issues * high self-esteem/confidence * versatile & easy-going (can dress to the nines and go clubbing or stay in and watch Netflix) * intelligent without being either insecure about it or dumbing down her intelligence so guys like her * respects my independence/alone time and expects the same from me * can speak her mind, doesn't play games, and generally communicates like an adult * sense of humor * caring, kind, and empathetic towards others (you feel she would be a good mother) * ambitious and driven about whatever her passion is in life (having kids and being a housewife does not count) As you can see, it's not surprising that I am single. The above package might as well be a unicorn, but I guess I'm still holding out for something close.	At 30 years old and having had three serious long term relationships, I am pickier than ever. I really cannot think of anything that makes me want to "work" for a girl. The mere thought of having to "work" to get a girl is a huge turn-off. It’s impossible to neatly delineate what makes a girl long term potential, and it usually takes a while to figure that out. With my previous ex, I initially just wanted a casual arrangement, but after a few months she forced the issue. At that point, I had fallen for her and was ready to give it a go. Had she forced the issue earlier, I would probably have been outta there fast. Sexual attraction is a prerequisite for romantic attraction, and I certainly don’t want to make a girlfriend or wife out of someone I don’t want to fuck.
What's your most cynical opinion on dating/relationships?	If you're dating a person, and they realize they don't see it going anywhere and break it off, get the hell over it.	My cynical opinion is usually about my own relationships. I'm waiting for the day my SO moves on to someone better than me. It's inevitable.
What's the first time you saw your SO cry?	This past weekend. She had her period really bad and was dealing with some issues. Not much I could do but cuddle her and bring her water/tissues.	I made him watch The Notebook with me and while I was uglycrying into his shirt I could see a little tear in his eye. He denied everything.
When do you stop doubting yourself when dating a girl?	Women play games, assume any disinterest is that. Don't care too much about the relationship, if you start to build up its importance you will act clingy. If it works out its fine, if it doesn't its also fine.	It has only been one date. Even if everything went to shit you're barely invested in this relationship, if you can call it that. Fortunately for you, she asked to go on a second date. Now if I were you I'd be excited about my second date with this lovely lady and not coming up with a million reasons for it to go wrong. Don't be your own worst enemy here.
Married women of AW, what are the hardest/toughest parts of marriage?	The toughest part for me is only getting to have sex with one man for the rest of my life. I suppose I could cheat, but that involves effort and lying and I just don't have the time or the patience to deal with potential drama. I do have an excellent vibrator though, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.	* In-laws * Children * Division of household labor / chores * One partner getting laid off / unemployed for a long time * Budgeting finances * One partner getting a job offer in a different state / country * Coping with physical / mental health issues * Agreeing upon parenting styles
Fellas, how did you deal with the flagrant emotions of an ex after getting cheated on?	I went on to a cheating exes profiles, all of em, and cipy/pasted what she did to her page, bio, sent a copy to every single friend...etc.( also changed the emails/passwords. Took her months to recover the info and get her accounts back. ) i DESTROYED almost all of her friendships, ruined her life to such a degree she moved to another state. Even her parents treat her differently from what i hear. She was removed from the will. Gods i felt good getting that revenge.	Yeah you’re justified in feeling those emotions, you won’t heal fully if you’re holding onto it though. In time work on letting it go but for now I would say it’s reasonable to fee the way you do.
Men - how many of you have genuinely had negative thoughts about a woman because she hooked up with you the same day you met her?	If a girl sleeps with me on the day we met, I instantly rule her out as relationship material. Casual sex is fun, but I don't want my future wife to be the type of woman who has slept around. I'd be very willing to bet that most men feel the same way, regardless of the responses to this post.	I find sex to be a part of a healthy relationship (or friendship, to an extent). I think the only time a man will think poorly of a woman for having sex on the first date is if he was "playing her" from the start. Acting sleazy, disrespectful, asinine and then she still sleeps with him. He never had any respect for her to begin with and even less afterwards.
Would you rather be ghosted or an honest but hurtful explanation?	Ghosted. I don’t need an explanation and I don’t care. If someone doesn’t like something they can leave at any time and I’m 100% fine with that. No drama and no need to feel awkward for either party. I’ve been ghosted many a time and I prefer it. Also, I’m a ghost-er. If I meet someone I feel the need to ghost on, it’s because I know that no matter how kind or gentle I am, they would never accept my reason for discontinuing a relationship and it would become a fight. I don’t have the energy for that and I disappear.	An honest, and helpful explanation with as little drama as possible. Painful is fine as long as it’s not done on purpose
Has having a son impacted the way you look at and view men?	You'll probably have more luck in places like /r/mommit because a lot of people here don't have kids. But I don't think it's changed at all (but then again not my bio son)	Definitely. Growing up I was taught men are strong and no crying- leaving me to believe they didn't feel like girls do. My son is the sweetest most loving and caring boy I know. But it wasn't until then, that I viewed all guys as sweet little boys who've had to repress their emotions to be men. They just have tough exteriors but deep down inside is just a human who wants to be loved too :)
What is life like for an unattractive man?	Being conventionally unattractive has sort of been a blessing for me. Since I could never skate by on looks, I had to learn how to talk with women, develop interesting hobbies, educate myself, and become funny to be successful with women. Some of those skill translate well into other life skills like excelling at work and having the confidence to approach new people. And now that I am done with college, I have time for more personal development. I realized that the women who only place value on my apperance as the standard yes/ no are not people I want to associate with.	I never fully understood that I am ugly, my brother is good looking and what a difference that makes. Then we both got a job working at the same place on a contract. Hooooly shit was that depressing. Naively thinking she was talking to him because she was a friendly chatty person, then getting absolutely shut down for saying hello or smiling. By the receptionist. Or the girl at the sandwich shop. Or the barmaid. Or the person selling the train tickets. Or the people we worked with...wait a minute...is *everyone* treating him better than me? They are aren't they. Fuck.
How common is it for guys to slap their dick on a vagina before putting it in?	Literally never done this and I think anyone who does is a moron who gets all their ideas from porn.	I did it and my girl thought I didn't know where the vagina entry was, so now I don't do it because I don't want to embarrass myself.
Do you like guys butts? Why?	First, it's not cool for people to be slapping your butt and catcalling. Those people are harassing jerks. Second, yes, there are heterosexual women on this planet. That means they find men's bodies attractive, particularly parts that clench and thrust during sex. Why this would be a question, or a strange idea, I'm not sure.	Yep. Wanna grab it. Wanna smack it a bit. Wanna bite it a bit, like a cookie cutter shark, leave perfect little round hickeys on it. Wanna rim it. Wanna fuck it if that's allowed. Just...butts man. Butts. Wanna do butt stuff. Gender of person has no bearing on my booty desires. They are pure. Edit- have been informed by my good friend I need to use the phrase "eat the booty like groceries"
What's an issue that society is in complete agreement about, but you're skeptical?	In America at least, I'm totally against this new social justice movement going around. People are losing careers and being ashamed into not speaking their minds. People will throw their arms in the air to not censor movies, music, and art, but God forbid someone thinks Caitlin Jenner is mentally ill.	I say this as a genderqueer bi/pansexual person: I don't agree with the seeming majority of the LGBT+ community that a person's sexuality is basically the main part of who a person is. I don't think it's necessarily healthy or beneficial to describe one's self first and foremost by your sexuality. It is part of who a person is but I don't really agree with the huge focus on it as a defining characteristic. Edit: a word
What is something your SO does that makes you feel loved?	He leaves his clothes all over the apartment and when I tell him to pick them up he smiles and asks me 'what else are women for?'... Ah true love	He'll randomly stop in the middle of what he's doing and come snuggle me for a few minutes, then resume what he was doing. There's also a few little things, like picking something small up from the store that he knows/thinks I might like.
Very obese guys (400 lbs +) - how do you urinate without making a mess everywhere?	>400lbs I hope no one here is in that category, I HOPE SO. I mean ~250lbs would be a good WAKE-UP CALL for ANYONE to take it down a 1000 notches.	This will likely get buried but at my heaviest I weighed around 460 lbs, it definitely wasn't easy but it was manageable. Going sitting down was almost impossible, using a urinal required way more effort than it should. I definitely made more messes than i'd like to admit especially while inebriated. I'm currently down 85 lbs and going strong though and things are significantly easier all around.
What's the naughtiest but wholesome thing you've done?	I stole a book from a free library, bc it had bad stuff in it. I replaced it with a children’s book about superheroes.	I stole $20 from my mom when I was in 4th grade. During that same day, instead of buying cookies for myself, I gave the $20 to another kid who didn't have any lunch. I remember a couple of days before, I went in the lunch line with him and the lady gave him a PB&j sandwich because his parents weren't paying for his lunch. I remember how disappointed he was because it was pizza day. So...to see him not get any lunch at all days after, it bothered me. I knew I could have used $1 to buy cookies and given him some money. But when they give you pb&J's that means that you already have a bill that your parents haven't been paying. I don't know how much he owed the cafeteria, but I do know that I at least took off $20.
Are there any women out there who can give a first hand account as to why we don't see more of your gender in STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) career fields? What's your personal story?	I don't do it because I'm not interested in it. Quite simple. If I had to guess, though, I'd say it's because women like to have options. We like it when there is more than one answer to a given situation. Men, however, just want 1 answer, because it's much simpler that way. Edit: IMO	There are a lot of women here saying they're engineers because they were told they could do anything a man could and are breaking gender stereotypes but I gotta say, I'm an engineer because I like science. the end
Bisexual ladies who have had relationships with both women and men, what are the things that you can do with your boyfriend but not girlfriend; or with your girlfriend but not boyfriend?	Weirdly... I've found that men seem to be wayyyyyy more insecure and jealous. With women, I can fuck them and then like right after talk about someone else I'm also dating or just anything. Men.... You like accidentally run into someone you dated and they are peacocking the rest of the day. And god the hand holding in bed with men. It's incredibly uncomfortable how immature and unaware men are. Gender role wise god it's a fucking relief dating a woman. Even just personally never having to perform femininity even In Public because people will just be like oh she's the dyke which whatever I'll take it.	I'm more aware or paranoid out with a woman vs a man. Even when I'm just out with a straight friend I'm still alert to whether people are looking because I dress pretty androgynous or soft butch. Like the time my bff and I were out eating and got a stare down from this old couple. I assume they were staring us down because they thought we were together, I don't really know for sure but this was in a town that never felt very hospitable to queer women.
What are your feelings on the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of going braless under your clothes?	Honestly, when I see a woman's nipples showing obviously through her shirt, I think it looks really trashy. The only times I go braless is when I'm wearing a super thick top/jacket (where it really doesn't matter) and am just running out to grab something real quick.	I literally have nightmares about being braless. That I turn up somewhere, like work and don't have a bra on underneath my clothing. I feel embarrassed, and just want to go home and put on a bra. I have gone out with a sports bra on instead of a normal bra, or if I'm really tired/sick I'll wear one of those camis with a shelf bra, and wear a hoodie over it so it isn't noticeable. I feel naked and frumpy without a bra. Maybe if I had smaller breasts, it wouldn't bother me. But I don't like the feeling of them just being loose and unrestrained.
Women who have posted "me too" on social media, what have the responses you've had been like?	I have seen a LOT of feminists get pissy about it bc those who claim Me Too aren't doing it right apparently... So many links to Huffington post articles man	A lot of apologies and silent support from friends. A couple of guy friends also posted "me too". It's so sad. It shouldn't happen to anyone, ever.
What are some good crime/drama series that aren’t focused on sexual assault (stuff like breaking bad) ???	Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows. It's a crime drama that focuses on the psychological aspects of crimes and criminals, mostly serial killers. The crime scenes may be too intense for some viewers, but it's a very loved show by those that watch it.	Person of interest. It's about an artificial intelligence that can predict crimes. I can't think of any sexual assault situations at all. It becomes more serialized as the series goes on but I think it was handled well
I have a daughter with another on the way. What is the one thing your Dad did right/or wish your Dad did?	I have nothing to add in terms of fathering advise, but you may want to research a bit more in-depth. Delightful anecdotes from internet commenters are fine, but child-rearing is obviously a pretty broad and complex topic. Doubtless, there are hundreds of quality books in this area that are not 'hippy new age bullshit.' This is probably a good question for a research librarian, actually.	My dad loves the crap out of me. That makes all the mistakes I can see as an adult ok. * He remembered to change how he treated me as I got older by gradually treating me more as an equal. * He is always gracious to new boyfriends. * He always encouraged me into math and science but never made it about me being a girl. Instead it was all about bettering my future.
If you got the attention women typical get from men, how well would you cope?	I wouldn't be suicidal and depressed and could use my intellect to make the world a better place instead of trying to figure out how to get attention from woman and I would propably become a slut and an influencer	Start a thirst trap IG. Sell tummy tea and fashionNova Take pictures in my draws put on a wig and say it's cosplay. Sell the pictures on patreon.
Men who voluntarily choose not to have a girlfriend, why don't you want a girlfriend?	women are annoying needy have expectations want too much talk to too many guys that are "friends" - lol wastes time getting wasted and drunk (atleast most chicks my age wanna do this) and they just don't want to have 1 guy, every girl ive ever tried to GF always has like 3+ guys on the go - fuck that i've been single for 10 years now, going on no sex for 5 - i LOVE it, i honestly don't think ill ever date/have sex again, life is 1000x better when you're not concerned with what ass you wanna pound next	At the moment I'm voluntarily being single because I have a bunch of shit I need to focus on sorting out (getting dental work done, buying a car again, moving to a new apartment, etc) and while I COULD do those things in a relationship, it'd be financially a lot more difficult since I'd be spending money or time (the latter of which can be used to make the former) on a girl instead of getting those other things fixed. I'm also enjoying having no obligations to another person at the moment, and I like being free to do what I want with little repercussion for another person besides myself. Just a bunch of shit really - I've had relationships and I've enjoyed them but I can live without one just fine for the time being.
I woke up to find my roommate's menstrual blood all over our toilet. Ladies, what are your roommate horror stories?	My ex roommate developed a brain tumor that caused him to slip into dream like states while being awake. This caused him to freak out, take off his clothes, grab kitchen knives, run in and out of the house, break things, and he did this every day. Cops were called often. Then he became utterly irrational. Like a cabinet door being left open caused him to toss all my belongings into the garage, breaking valuables, and smashing the front bumper of my car. He was crazy, and honestly, I think if the brain tumor kills him, it will be a good thing.	My flatmate has been ignoring me, and apparently it's my fault because when i sit next to her in lectures I quietly say 'hi' (instead of what? organising a mariachi band to play on her arrival?), then last week had guests sleeping on our kitchen/living room floor, who left because I told them to stop fucking in my kitchen as my bedroom is right next to it. Then the next night she had friends over until 2am, where she apologised for me being 'so rude' for telling these people to stop fucking, and telling everyone how she'd 'tried' to be nice to me but I have 'no empathy'. Y'know, while I was in my bedroom, able to hear everything...
What victories did you have this week? What defeats did you have this week?	Fucked a girl so hard she bled. That was a nice feather in my cap. I got killed by Tempered Teostra. I'm better than that.	Victories: Revealed who my true friends are. Caught a would be thief at work. Didn't die (well it's a victory.) Defeats: Revealed who were not my friends. Got dumped by girl of my dreams and lost her friendship (were close friends for over a decade). So I call it a bad week. Onwards and upwards.
What’s a fact that you just can’t wrap your head around/accept?	The fact that people STILL think that Apple is still a viable option for technology, whether it be smartphones or laptops, I can't understand why people think that they make good products. There is not ONE thing that Apple does better than say... Samsung. This means that the only reason people are buying Apple products is because they're uneducated. Sure, personal preference is a thing, but are you really going to give up _much_ better performance, value, features, pricepoints, and true innovation for a change in how your home screen looks? Don't even bring up benchmark scores... everyone knows that those numbers don't correlate whatsoever to every day usage. It's been *proven*.	That Jupiter isn't just the largest object in our solar system, save for the sun. Jupiter is more massive than *every single other object* in our solar system *combined*, save for the sun. Also, that it has a single ancient storm so large it could swallow our entire planet three times over with room to spare. The size of Earth is hard enough to grasp. The size of Jupiter is mind-shredding.
What is something that is genuinely all right to hide from an SO?	Masturbation For some reason people I date ask me if I masturbate I do, everyone does but I'm going to say no because it's one of their business	How much of a slob you are when they're not around. They can assume... But they'll never know the true extent.
What's the story behind your worst date, in which you were the guilty one?	I once picked up a girl from hers that I was told had lost loads of weight since high school. She hadn't, I just walked around miserable the whole date and did not message her again. I'm a bad person :(	When I was younger I would go on a lot of online dates with this particular story I was on a second date with a girl and it wasn't really going well. I could tell that she wasn't particularly interested and neither was I so I was just going to cruise through the night and be done with it. At this time I was hooking up with my neighbor. While my date was in the bathroom I texted my neighbor saying that I'll be done soon and to stop and get some beer from the corner. I accidentally sent that text to my date...she came back from the bathroom saying "so I got your text..." I pretty much panicked, apologized profusely and we both admitted the date was not going well and we called it a night.
Women with anger issues, how did/do you cope and calm yourself down?	I stop seeing my passion as anger. I use the strength in me, the dragon, for good. I give her space, I love her and honor that part of me. Now instead of screaming she sings.	When I get angry, I say everything I want to say in my head and only say it aloud only if I still think it’s a good idea 10 minutes later
How do you feel about period sex?	FUCK YEAH!!! Is how i feel about it. My girlfriend doesn't use any contraceptives. We use condoms, of course. But come period time it is bareback and come inside that's on the menu. I have a hard time containing my excitement that time of month. And yes i am aware of the risk we are still taking. If we have kids now, while taking this risk now, we'll just have to deal with it.	With my girlfriend? No problem, might just use a condom to keep my willy clean. With a random girl from the bar? That's an other story.
What was the moment you realized you didn't love your significant other anymore?	we were having sex and she had poo on her butthole. i felt the love leave me. it was the end anyway, but man did that let me know.	Friend of mine went on a vacation with her husband of 3 years, a few years ago. They booked a private cruse around the gulf for the evening, fancy dinner, all that stuff. So after the dinner, in the middle of the ocean, after they finished a slow dance, he just blurts out "I don't love you anymore. I want a divorce." And pulled a packet out with the divorce papers he had gotten some lawyer to draft up. She said the real shock was looking at them and seeing that he had already signed them. Fun boat ride back I'm sure.
Have you ever been initially rejected by someone, and then gotten together at some later point? How did the relationship turn out?	That's actually how my current GF and I started out. She was dating someone long distance and the relationship was already not going well (BF was from a strict Asian family, she's white, etc.) and I would always be her 'date' whenever our mutual friends would go out. So eventually we developed feelings for each other and I just came out and said "I think we should be together." She initially turned me down, and later that week went to go visit her BF for the first time in months. It was supposed to be a week, she was back 2 days later at my place. We never looked back, and have been together for 3 years.	I was FWB with a girl for a while, I asked her to be my girlfriend twice and she said no both times. About a month later she started introducing me to people as her boyfriend, I just rolled with it.
Ladies, What are some things your SO does after sex that makes you happy?	We must be weird, because we high-five and tell each other how great it was. Then we clean up and cuddle. We are a heterosexual couple.	Sometimes after we finish he will press his forehead against mine for a moment. I don't know why but it melts my heart.
What are some social situations were you would rather want to be treated like a person of the opposite sex?	Treated as if I were a woman or for women to act towards me the way men act towards women?	Moving day. Would be great if all my female friends who are secretly hoping to hookup with me would come out of the woodwork and help me move furniture.
Women who are very financially successful, how did you get there and what advice do you have for others?	Haha! Sorry your post didn't work out, I was excited to see the answers! Maybe this is all society brain washing us in to thinking having a house and budgeting your groceries on 50k a year in a fly-over-state is what it means to be rich. Glad those women are happy with their lives but I wanted to hear from people that don't GAF what they spend on groceries!	Not there yet, but I'm doing much better after I started *really* considering that everything costs money. I mean like not buying those $20 shoes that seem *so* cheap but I can do without, the small stuff really adds up quick. Something else I noticed: I spend less when I go to the supermarket less often and buy a lot of stuff that lasts over a week. If I have to keep going to the store, I'm *certainly* going to spend money on stuff I don't need.
Single Men of Reddit (25+), what's your biggest insecurity stopping you from meeting women?	Not single ATM, but when I was it was my fear of getting #MeToo'd for looking at a woman the wrong way combined with my aversion for the bullshit that is online dating.	Near total lack of experience with dating and relationships, complete lack of a social life, lack of chance to meet single women when I do interact socially. Among other things. I mean, take your pick, really. I've got alot of options...
OK, so are wide leg pants back in or not? Is the fashion world lying to me? What trends have you been wary of?	I don't like winged eyeliner. I think its not the look that looks best on most people. Ugh don't shoot me Oh and normal bootcut flares jeans are always in style. They are cute. Jeans that are expensive jeans are always in style.	I'm wary of most fashion trends that end up being super-trendy! Things I have said: * "I'll never wear ballet flats" * "I'll never wear skinny jeans" * "I'll never wear leggings" * "I'll never wear leggings as pants" * "I'll never wear maxi dresses/skirts" * "I'll never wear high-waisted pants" I wear all of these things. But I really don't like wide-legged pants! I don't see that changing, but looking back.... we'll see what happens in a few months.
How do you get a 23 year old male adult to move out of your home?	poor kid. parents bring you into the world, mess you up and then kick you out when they don't want to have a constant reminder of the result of their incompetent upbringing staring them in the face around the house. and plz don't go comparing today to the good old days when your dad kicked you out of the house when you were just 15 - grandpa was ignorant af - that's not an excuse to be one too and it's actually much harder to make a living (or get a degree) today than it used to be. Wages have declined considerably from what they were a generation ago and college tuition is now as epxensive as a house. So yeah, go ahead, kick him out on the street. That no good bum, it's all his fault that he is this way right?	Make him start paying rent. He's an adult, if he wants to remain in the household, he pays rent, he contributes to chores. Tell him he's too old for you to be doing all his shit for him.
Women who have PCOS, what are some struggles you have that other women may not know about?	The fear of not being able to have kids. We don't use any contraception and we've never had a pregnancy scare in 5yrs of being together	The hair growth. The crippling pain. Not just oh my uterus is aching. The pain sometimes can drop you to your knees. The fast weight gain as a teen. The depression from all of the above. The medication that makes you feel worse than ever.
Tired of being a Nice Guy. What does it take to be a Good Guy?	In retrospect, I think that the nice guy problems that I had could have been largely prevented by not trying to make female friends. That just set me up for the problems described in Ladder Theory. Guys are for friends. Women are for dating. Keep the boundaries clear. If I fall for a female friend, I'm almost inevitably friendzoning myself. Also: be you. Maybe that's being a nice guy--polite, kind, and respectful. Embrace who you are and accept that a whole lot of women will have zero interest in you but prefer men that you regard as jerks or otherwise your social inferiors. Be who you are and let other people--including women that you find attractive--be who they are. Don't concern yourself with the values of other people, let alone get upset about them.	> I joined r/niceguys to try and identify nice guy behavior in myself and cure it if I can **but no one really gives advice on what to do, just what not to do.** Let me reveal the truth to you then, young grasshopper. What you must do, without fail, is to find self-love and self-confidence. To find self-love, you must find yourself believably attractive. To find yourself believably attractive, you must have positive, interesting qualities. To have positive, interesting qualities, you must have genuine interests and emotions that do not gravitate around yourself and your resentment. To have interests and emotions that do not gravitate around resentment, you must learn not to blame others for your failures. To not blame others for your failures, you must learn to appreciate errors. At that point, the young student attained great enlightenment.
Mothers of AW, what's the last thing your child said/did, that made you say "yup, that's my girl/boy"?	It's a weird experience to be a parent. To have this life that you love so much and that pride pours out of you at the littlest experiences. My son is 3 years old and here are a few recent instances: -He wrote his name for the first time! -Watching him do summersaults and balance beam and follow directions at gymnastics class. -He potty trained himself this summer. Pride is something you feel for your children on an almost daily basis, at least when they are young! They are learning and growing so much, that watching them roll over for the first times makes pride swell.	I randomly get Snapchat selfy videos from my daughter with wacky overlay graphics. This causes me to roll my eyes and laugh out loud, which of course is why she does it. She's in her 30's.
Ladies--the video of the car plowing down protestors in Charlottesville is haunting me. What are your ways of putting good into the world to try and balance all the evil out?	Any comments advocating violence against anyone will be removed. This is a site-wide rule set by the administrators of the site.	Any comments advocating violence against anyone will be removed.

I don't drink alcohol and people give me a hard time about it. How do you feel when someone tells you they don't drink?	That's a pretty big dealbreaker for me as far as dating or best-friend-ship goes. It limits potential group social activities, and I firmly believe that wine is one of the most important aspects of a romantic dinner.	How old are you? I find the amount of shit you get for it decreases as you get older and it becomes more likely that you're in AA or pregnant or on medication or don't want to cope with hangovers or whatever. There are tons of reasons not to drink, many of which are pretty personal, and as people get out of the "Woohoo! Alcohol!" phase they start to figure that out.
Do you guys ever ponder why it seems that in a general sense, women want men less than vice-versa?	Men are supposed to be the romantic ones. I want a romantic woman too. I like to be wined and dined before I get fucked too, ya'know.	According to the evolutionary theory, having sex for women tends to be more "expensive" than it is for men. Females have one large expensive gamete (egg) every month. Meanwhile men have millions of gametes in each ejaculation. On top of that, if a female gets pregnant, she is guaranteed a pregnancy and nursing which is costly in time and resources. Males are not required to stick around and help raise the offspring. So, because sex tends to have more consequences for females, they are more choosy and picky. They need to make sex count. For men, they just need to make sure their sperm gets spread as much as possible, so they tend to be less picky and more willing to do it. Obviously, this doesn't apply much to today's people, but that mindset is probably still there subconsciously.
Why don't you want to get a girlfriend?	Biology. 1. Women want a man who is genetically superior, and who will, willingly, support her offspring until they die; 2. Men want to fuck everything that dresses nicely on a Friday night. Mismatch.	My last two relationships were 3 and 5 years respectively and after the last one I realized I like my freedom more than I like having a girlfriend. I like eating where I want to eat, leaving the bars when I'm ready to leave, going on random trips without having to ask permission or working around another schedule. I was tied down for so long I forgot what freedom was like and I'm not giving it up anytime soon.
Moms of AskWomen, how do you discipline your children? What method has been most effective?	We do not use punishment at all in my family. My children are 8, 11 and 14 and have never been punished or disciplined in any traditional sense of those words. I respect them and partner with them to solve problems that arise. I work to understand their behavior and the underlying reasons behind it and help them to manage their feelings and actions. I only say no when i have to and take their interests and desires seriously. They are all well adjusted, kind, confident and compassionate kids.	My daughter is 13. Taking away electronics as by far the most effective discipline for her. She usually throws a bossy fit for the first hour. I just keep my cool. Then the next day or two she is good as gold. I usually let her earn them back faster if she does lots of chores.
Let's get personal. What has been the worst event that has occurred in your life and how have you dealt with it?	My divorce from my 16yr marriage was finalized in Sept of 2016, I essentially had a nervous breakdown that Christmas because I had nobody to spend it with. I made amends with my parents January 1st 2017. My son's cat then got hit right in front of me about 10pm Jan 2nd. My employee called me the morning of Jan 3rd to tell me he totaled my 2016 Charger RT-Max and left the scene. My dad then died 1yr ago today, as I held his hand in his hospital room, I watched him take his last breath and his eyes turn gray. It was by far the worst 9 months of my life. Shout out to my counselor, psychologist and anti-depressants that have helped me the past year.	Probably the year span when my dad (55) died in a plane crash, and then 10 months later my mom (52) got diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer and then died within a week of the one year anniversary of my dad dying. I now call that week in July death week. Obviously very sad, lots of grief and mourning. It'll be 10 yrs from my dad's death this year. It doesn't really affect my daily life any more. I still miss them, but I have moved on and can enjoy life again.
Most snobbish behavior you've ever encountered?	Oh man. There was a guy on the bus who scolded me for putting my feet on the seat. I was sitting with one leg folded under my other. It's not like I was treating it like a damn ottoman! And it was the bus. In NYC. A homeless person probably peed on it before. I know this doesn't seem to snobbish, but if you saw the way he said it, you'd know why this is still with me like 3 years later.	My friend was on a break while working at subway and asked a lady where she had gotten her shoes (they were really cute) The lady replied, "don't talk to me minimum wage" and left in a huf. We were too shocked to say anything.
What are some tips you have for someone moving into her first apartment?	Always buy furniture and expensive decor that you like, not that fits your apartment. Our couch is an absolutely huge sectional, and our bed takes up a whole wall, but when we move out, at least we won't have to buy new furniture that fits our new space because we already have it!	When you move, regardless of how far you're going, have toilet paper ready and also some garbage bags. What I usually do is load a tall garbage can with all the bathroom stuff (shower curtain, hand soap, etc), toilet paper, water, and garbage bags, and bring that in first. Don't forget a plunger for each bathroom, either!
What was the weirdest thing a woman has ever done to you?	One time this woman kept me prisoner in her womb, and kicked me out 9 months later. Fuckin weird shit man.	Tried to set me on fire for no reason. She wasn't mad or anything. She just held a lighter to my back and scorched my jacket a little before I noticed
How do you meet introverted women?	Break into houses. The cop that arrests you might be a female, and they might be introverted. With this method you also have a solid opening conversation as she is probably into justice and the law. Talk about that and see where it goes.	introverted doesn't nessesarly mean shy or anti-social. you'll have a hell of a time trying to small talk, but i find many introverts can talk a storm if you hit a topic they're interested or passionate about. with that in mind, use that to your advantage. since your introverted too, meet women at places your passionate about. comic conventions, libraries, museums, churches, concerts, whatever floats your boat.
What's the most ironic thing about your relationship with your SO?	We were friends first so of course when we first started talking about sex we only talked about it being fwb. Because friends.	Our first conversation involved me stating that I had absolutely no desire to be in a relationship with anyone and him informing me that he was completely content with the possibility of being single for life.
Domestic abuse situations are often characterized by the abuser being perfect, charming, and loving at the beginning of the relationship. What are some red flags to watch out for at the start of a new relationship?	I've always followed this rule: Watch how they treat the elderly, children, animals, and waitstaff. If animals, the elderly, and children seem to not like them, then there might be something you're just not noticing.	If they get jealous of pets and children. Ex would get mad if I cuddled my cat when he was over because it was "our time." Also got jealous of the kids I worked with. One kid would give me lots of hugs and he hated that. I understand not liking kids, but being jealous of a five year old is a bit weird.
What company you used to love has really been disappointing you lately?	Apple. I used to love Apple and I had a mac before most of my friends did, but ever since they've become super popular the quality has gone downhill. It's a bummer.	My VS bras used to last a long time. I know something changed over time because they're bras started to fall apart quickly, like in 1-2 months. I don't even bother with going in the stores anymore.
What is your petty workplace feud about, a who is it with?	Presently it's about a lunch treat, an invite was sent to everyone in the office, except my small department. When a friend from another department asked the person why, they said they forgot thought they got everyone on the email. So then forwarded the email to my department without so much as an "oops" or "sorry" but a lame comment on extra dessert for us or something. Safe to say, skipping the lunch. And cold shoulder to the treating team.	So, one shift my partner and I got slammed with back to back calls and didn't have time to put any gas in the ambulance at the end of the day. Ok, kind of a jerk move, but it still had at least half a tank. It happens. WELL. The incoming crew was pissed off to an unreasonable level. Every time I'm their relief crew, they intentionally do not fill the ambulance, and will sometimes even leave it completely trashed for me to deal with when I clock in, and will gleefully tell me to go get gas on their way out the door. GUYS IT WAS ONE TIME! WHY MUST WE CONTINUE LIKE THIS?
Ladies, what examples of "office politics" have you come across in your career and how did you deal with it?	A coworker will never discuss problems. She will go directly to our boss and complain or go on a rant during a meeting. Most recently, my boss approached me suggesting I do something. Something she asked me to do that morning. I explained once again that it violated policies to do that again so soon and we would either have to order more of a resource than she initially requested or get approval to make an expensive change made to our existing protocol.	I will advise you to be careful in defending yourself, OP, as an employee with years of trust built up can easily spin something like that too make you look like not only did you do a crappy job, but now you refuse to take responsibility for it. Make sure the manager is flat lying about receiving it, rather than spinning it as a quality judgment on what was received. You can be in the right and still get screwed.
What do you think could be done to lower male suicide rate?	I think the male success rate is higher, because men choose more violent methods. Women tend to want to leave a pretty corpse, so they use less successful methods, but in fact they attempt suicide more. Both of these statistics are bad, and I think in order to lower attempted suicide for women and successful suicide for men, our mental health care system needs reformation.	Stop stigmatizing mental health care, stop viewing men as weak for having feelings, stop treating men like we're disposable, stop denying men support when we reach out for it. I could go on but it's late.
Women who had an affair: what did/do you think of the man you cheated on?	I've never cheated and it kind of annoys me when they say "my relationship was falling apart". When my relationships were falling apart, I fixed it and talked through our problems or we broke up. I never resorted to cheating. I just don't get it. I guess I have too much of a conscience.	You know what, he was really nice. We had a good relationship. He was nice to me, we had fun together, etc. But I didn't love him, and I don't think he loved me. We were more like good friends that had a lot in common and our relationship had no passion. I had no ill thoughts of him, I was just young, naive and bored and I fell in love with someone else and was too immature to understand I owed it to him to wait and be honest rather than going behind his back and acting on it first. It's been damn near a decade, but I still regret it.
Middle-aged men - do you still find your middle-aged spouse (or women your own age in general) attractive?	> the outlook is bleak for women. You think it is better for men? How many older men you actually see with much younger women?	Here I am at 70 going on 71. In all that time since I was 14 or so, I never had that idea that the woman (girl) has to look like - fill in the current blank from the beauty ads or the barbi doll collection. So my current S.O. is a couple years older than me. Her skin feels just like skin, her breasts feel like breasts, and all the other parts feel the same and respond the same. The visuals and whatever about the wrinkles and sags - are the same for me as for her. I am not what I used to be, but hey - I am still alive, and still sensual. So is she.
Ladies, what is the hardest most difficult part of loving your man or being in a relationship with him?	When you say "difficult to love" in my mind it implies that the love is conditional. If it were difficult to love my man then I probably would see that as a red flag and would not be with him. Small annoyances that I do not agree with do not make it hard to love him. We all have things that our significant other doesn't specifically enjoy about us but that shouldn't test our love for them. If you are TRYING to love someone then you are being inauthentic. You shouldn't have to try.	When he's upset he closes off completely. I understand it; he likes to deal with whatever he's going through on his own, in his own time. I'm a very direct person and our methods with dealing with problems really clash. When he goes silent and distant on me I turn it all inwards and wonder if I'm doing something wrong, or get frustrated that he won't confide in me. Ultimately how I deal with it is force myself to think from his perspective and leave him be when he needs it. It's painfully against my nature to do so, but I try my best.
If a woman can't cook, is that a deal breaker?	It's important that she has big breasts so she can feed my children well. Cooking is not too important in comparison. She can learn to cook. She's got many years to improve.	I view it as a plus. I love cooking, and I hate it when my partners get in the way when I'm in the kitchen. I hate when my pans get ruined, and when my knives get treated treated wrong I get a shiver down my spine. So get the hell out of my kitchen. Open the bottle of wine to breathe. The risotto will be ready in twenty minutes.
How genuine/platonic are your friendships with females?	I know not everyone agrees. But, I don't think men and women can be friends. Most guys would have sex with their female friends if they were down imo.	There are girls I won't pursue just because I don't wanna fuck up the friendship dynamic, but unless she's ugly, there is no such thing as a female friend I wouldn't have sex with if she came on to me.
Whats your favorite hobby that you don't have people to share it with?	Physics and advanced mathematic topics. Topology, abstract algebra, knot theory. But as soon as I mention anything quantum, the eye glaze begins	I like playing DnD but it's difficult to find other people that play. The stigma is strong where I live.
Why are so many men homeless? What can be done to help them?	For the same reason that the suicide rate of men is 3-5x higher than women. Nobody cares about the problem's of men, if you show emotion, you are immediately looked down upon. Divorced? Take half your money and your kids. Can't provide for yourself? Fucking loser. I am not going to downplay the struggles that women have, but men have their own too, only we can't talk about ours without subtly (or not subtly) being looked down upon.	I know a lot of it has to do with being veterans in the military. Having more support for our veterans would be a good start.

Men with a micro penis, what's it like using a urinal?	When my peepee is cold, it’s pretty shrunk and small. I just give it a good ol’ single tug to stretch it out make it a five inch flaccid peepee hose. Much more comfortable to go weeee.	Not an owner of a micropenis, but I do have a fairly unique take on urinal use. I had a birth defect involving my urethra, so now that it's been corrected the opening of the urethra isn't 100% at the tip, and isn't there same shape as a normal person's. As a result I have literally zero aim. The stereotypical hangover erection stream deviation is me on a good day. So for me urinals are off limits unless I absolutely have to. I usually sit, and still hold and aim it down. If I have to stand up I'm almost certainly going to either make a mess, or stand so close that I get splashback.
Anyone else extremely uncomfortable how so many people are acting because they can't harass fat people on reddit anymore?	something about it strikes me as really...sad. like i just imagine these flabby, skinnyfat weirdos sitting in front of their computer typing away about being mad that they can't talk shit about fat people on the internet. the level of involvement they have in just talking shit about fat people seems really weird. and sad. and puzzling like, who are these people. what are their stories	I do not understand how people aren't clear that the issue with the bannings is not that the banned subs expressed abhorrent opinions (although they do), but that as a practice they supported or condoned harassment of other users. *That* is the problem. If you want to hate on fat people in your own sub without brigading or stealing users' images to mock, you're a shit person and your life is a joke, but whatever. It's the harassment that's the problem. Also, the concept of "free speech" relates to the relationship between citizen and state, not internet rando and social media site.
I'm a woman moving into a house with five other guys. What can I expect and what should I/shouldn't I do?	Don't flush your tampons, it can clog the toilet. Wrap it in tp and put it in the trash can. Don't walk around in your underwear. They will expect you to cook and clean, make sure the responsibilities are shared for everyone. The house will stink. There will probably be random sloots getting railed at different times of the day and night. If a door is closed and it's extremely quiet or there's music playing, come back later and don't shake their hands. Make sure they have a vague idea when it's shark week, it will probably be the most peaceful week of the month.	ALWAYS KNOCK. SOFTLY. There's no need to pound. You don't want to walk in on one beating it. You also don't want to give him a heart attack and manhandle his dick when he flinches from random pounding on the door. Source: both have happened to me.
Ladies in a relationship, what is one thing your SO has expressed he/she would like you to do, but you know there's no chance in hell that you'll do it?	Sex without condoms. We've had this discussion 3 or 4 times since March (I got Nexplanon) and each time I tell him firmly, No. I'm not comfortable going without condoms. Yesterday he asked me via text message (after I had just told him no the night before) and I told him that him pushing the issue made me upset because as far as I was concerned, the answer was and still is no. If he wants to have sex without a condom, he can find someone else or use his hand but the answer is no and he needs to drop it.	I'll try almost anything my husband asks, but he told me he wants 12 children and that's something I'm inclined to say no to. At least not biologically. If we adopt a bunch then sure, we planned on adopting anyway in addition to biological children.
Halloween is coming up! In your opinion, what is the sexiest costume that a man could wear?	I'll be going as the perfect physical, mental, and spiritual being. The truth, the light, and the way. I do this every day naturally but I'll do it in a sexy way on halloween. So that's what I suggest.	Ancient warrior of some sort. That would do it for me. Egyptian, Greek, Celtoi...doesn't matter. It hits all the right notes. Anne Rice vampire, yeeees. However, funny is sexy too. Though a guy in a sexy costume would make me turn me head, I'm also less likely to approach them. Funny is more approachable.
What are your best sex stories?	One time a woman offered to take my virginity. So we met up, had some wine, went back to my place and... Well we did a lot of stuff. But I couldn't get an erection, so we didn't actually have intercourse. And now I'm really depressed. That's my best and only sex story.	She got way too drunk on our lunch date at the bar. We go back to her place and she smokes weed for the first time ever. She gets super twisted. Despite me being 100% explicit about only wanting something casual, no omission just upfront she now decides to start crying and telling me she really wants a boyfriend. She takes on a 3rd person demon voice. "Fuck her. She wants you to fuck her just fuck her" no joke throaty like a movie I ask where the water is, grab my shit and sneak out. She texts me angrily 20 min later and then adds me on snapchat 3 months later.
What's an innocent remark someone made towards you that you actually found very hurtful?	I had an ex boyfriend call me Aphrodite...I was like wow dude you can’t even use my name? Idc how good u think the sex is, don’t frickin refer to me as a cardboard sex icon from a dead society’s religion....(real talk tho I love mythology, just not when he used it to reduce me to a figure)	My sister was always the cool girl growing up. Pretty face and perfect body. I was the opposite of her. Anyway this happened on multiple occasions especially with distant family we had not seen for awhile. They would look at her and tell her "Oh wow you are so pretty" then look at both of us side by side and say "Man! You two don't even look like sisters!" Didnt tell anyone it hurt my feelings. I just laughed it off. Now I'd like to think I've blossomed into a decent looking person. Only took 30 years lol.
Hey guys. What is your hobby/ an activity you would suggest trying?	really? nobody has said weightlifting? well, mine is just that. there is nothing like pushing your body to the limits, you can make strength and size gains, as well as get a sweet pump. plus your body gets flooded with endorphins	I open up the tripadvisor listings for my city, see an important historical thing that seems interesting and make a day-trip of it. It works on many levels: a) You can actually know of cool things to see in the city when you have out-of-towners visit. b) You learn good dating spots and activities.
How do you feel about paid paternity leave and do you think it should be equal to paid maternity leave?	It should exist and yes it should be equal. Raising a child is always stressful, and new parents dealing with a newborn have to change their whole world around. They need their rest and they need time with their child - especially the fathers because they don't bond as naturally with the baby. I don't have a child yet, so I'm sure there are a lot more factors I'm missing, but from what I do know, I think the father needs the ability to be with his kid just as much as the mother. It's not just about physical recovery time.	I think there is a period of time that the mother needs off because of the physical demands of giving birth/breastfeeding. Besides that, either parent should have access to a period of parental leave, or they should be able to share it.
Guys in college/university majoring in any humanities degree, is the pc/safe space/trigger warning/censorship culture really as bad as shown on the media? Can you provide a reasonable argument in its favour that you buy?	It is utter crap. Free speech 100%. Always, forever. You don't like what I say, go die in a fucking fire before you curtail my speech. If WW II were to break out today, we'd all be speaking German in 6 months with the legions of pussy-men we have running around this country. Christ.	Modern history/cognitive science major here. Wrote my thesis on social trauma in Northern Ireland. When everything you read is about car bombings and people being executed in front of their family, trigger warnings become a massive hindrance and thus aren't used. Edit: typo
What on Earth do y'all do with your stuff ( like keys, phone, wallet) at a club?	When I used to go to the bar I ran a tab. I carried in my card and handed it to the bartender, then all I had to do was keep up with my car key because I kept everything else in my car. Then I'd wear my key like an ankle bracelet on a budgee type cord.	My technique definitely isn't best, but I usually use my bra. Debit card slid under one armpit, phone under the other (screen side out to avoid sweat getting under the glass) and then I normally have my normal bag with my keys, flat shoes and other stuff in which I will put in the cloakroom (I assume these are also a thing in the US?). Or, alternatively, take a guy and utilize his pockets and treat him like a bag. No shame. Though regardless of where everything else is, my phone will always be in my bra. My phone and I are very attached to each other and I get vaguely panicky if it's not in my immediate surroundings, especially if I'm drunk.
Do you ever feel like adult relationships are kind of...depressing?	Sort of. At least partially part of the reason I haven't bothered and have no experience with them. At times I think with all I plan to do and accomplish, and how busy my life is now, I'd rather not complicate it more with another person's feelings, thoughts, and desires. It's hard enough with my own.	I think adult relationships are awesome. As a teenager, they're about being cute and having fun and god forbid your boyfriend ever catch you with morning breath and messy hair. In an adult relationship, he's my partner, in every sense of the word. We've seen each other at our absolute worst, and we've worked our asses off to be the best we can be for ourselves as well as for one another. Adult relationships require a lot more, and they're far more fulfilling.
Guys who were interested romantically in your best (female) friend but feelings were unreciprocated, what are some things you wish said friend would've done/said in the aftermath of it? How did you manage to stay best friends with them?	Nah, you guys are fucked. The best way to get over this is if you get a bf, he will quickly get over you or just ghost him.	Never happened to me. I blame myself, but truthfully it doesn't matter who is to blame. I couldn't get past my feelings for them, and stay around. I stopped talking to them and moved on. Did I abandon them? Yes. Did it ruin their life? No. I'd rather leave and not turn into a "nice guy". All of them are happily married and we don't talk at all. I'm happy and they are too. All is well that ends well.
Women of Reddit, what game do you consistently play, and why?	Mostly I play with the emotions of unsuspecting young men, but I like word puzzles, cryptic crosswords, sudoku, and old school board games like Cluedo or kerplunk.	I've been playing Stardew Valley pretty consistently since it came out. I used to play harvest moon a lot back in the day so I was super excited when this came out.
She got too drunk on our special evening - ok to feel pissed?	IMO, you do not have a right to be pissed. You can be disappointed and let down, but angry? Nah. People fuck up sometimes. If you were taking her out to dinner and it was purely altruistic, yeah. But you wanted some special sexytime, didnt get it, probably pouted and made things worse. When life throws you a curveball you gotta deal with it better.	This has happened with my wife and I a few times in the last.. Oh... Decades... In the moment, your only concern would be her welfare. In the morning, you talk about things. If she still thinks you're an asshole for taking care of her while sick, including leaving to get her a Gatorade, that's a problem in the relationship. You'll need to evaluate things. If she apologizes in the morning, post hangover, and seems remorseful, I'd just chalk it up to an accident. If it keeps happening, then you'll need to talk to her about her alcohol consumption, or reevaluate the relationship.

What's your favorite healthy snack?	I eat lots of raw fruits and veggies. Generally apples and bananas for fruit and carrots or cucumbers for vegetables. I don't use dressing, but if I do, it's balsamic vinegar or hummus. If I'm a little more hungry, I like to have yogurt (plain, no flavours or sugar), or salsa and lettuce.	Air popped popcorn. No added oil or butter. Although I usually cook it on the stove with a little olive oil because it tastes so good. Great for when I'm craving salty carbs because it's fewer calories than any bread, bagels, crackers, chips, cereal, etc.
What was your "I can't believe that worked" moment when it comes to women?	High school gf broke up with me after our first semester of college. Panicking, calling, begging her not to leave; nothing worked. We met up on Christmas break back in our home state. Too tired and fed up trying, I walked out of her house and told her I didn’t give a shit anymore (I did). That momentary glimmer of alpha-independence literally had her sobbing on her floor holding my leg from me waling out the door. Why the fuck does it have to come to these psycho mind games?	After a party, everyone was leaving. Girl calls an Uber, I ask if I can ride share. She says “sure”, and we get in. She asked where I was going. “. Turns out she lives in the opposite direction to me. So I just said, “yours I guess”. She was like, “yer ok, sure”.
What is the worst entrapment a girl has ever tried to pull on you?	After reading these comments, I will never feign a pregnancy to keep a guy with me. That is horrible. Also, I'm really glad the guys who have called me "crazy" in the past obviously have no idea what they're talking about. I've never done half this shit. Lol Edit: Okay, I thought it was obvious but I guess not. I have not considered this before, and what I meant by my comment was I wouldn't ever consider it "after reading these comments". I appreciate all the judgments, but keep your own personal motives off my shit. Thanks.	My first serious girlfriend with whom we said I love you and all that broke up with me as a way to test me and see if I would fight to get her back. I didn't... Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Amirite?
Women of reddit, how do you deal with the 9-5 commuter lifestyle?	That's why I say fuck states and urban environments so dense you have to ride public transportation. +1 for the southeast, where I can live 10 minutes from downtown and still get to drive myself everywhere.	I love my time on the train. Perhaps I'm weird. But it's an hour of uninterrupted reading and music-listening time each day. Load up your phone or iPod with music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Subscribe to a few magazines. Get a few books. It can be frustrating when the train is delayed or overcrowded, definitely, but for the most part, I don't mind. Now if I had to drive, I'm sure I'd be insane.
Which celebrity have you been told you look like?	This happens so often for me I started keeping a list a few years back. Every listing here was volunteered by people at randomly as I go about my life. No one was asked and it wasn't pertinent to the conversation, but apparently the resemblance was so strong they had to tell me. This is the list copy and pasted. People I've been told I look like Burt Reynolds Jason Biggs. Died rich bayder, Ron Livingston, the lead singer from Metallica w/ shorter hair Danny masterson. John travolta in... From Paris with love Chris prat Seth rogen. Paul Rudd, liev schreiber, Robert di Nero, mark and Donnie whallberg, Leonardo di caprio, Vince Vaughn, Joshua Jackson, Christopher mints-place John Hannah John favreau Ray liota Tom hanks Danny mcbride Young Richard Dreyfus Hugh Jackman Dane cook Owen Wilson Young Orson wells Peter sarsgard Stuart gill Paul giamatti Ben affleck	Robert Downey Jr. I was told I looked like him a lot. This was in the 90s. One time we were watching E! and a story about him getting arrested came on and my 2 years old son started pointing at the tv saying daddy. But that was the 90s, today not so much.
What are your "moves" in a date?	I cut a hole in the bottom of the popcorn tub, stick my penis in it and bet her 50 bucks she can't empty the tub using only her lips.	I've found that the sooner you can get in the mindset of two old friends catching up instead of two people being on a first date, the more relaxed you are and the more fun it is for them.
Whats the unwritten rule at your job?	Don't wear plaid, unless you're a girl then you just shouldn't wear plaid but noone will say anything to you about it. AKA almost everyone wears plaid on Fridays.	If there's free cake or cookies in the kitchen, you get one and only one serving. Don't be a hog.
In the last three weeks I've been laid off from my job, my SO ended things, and I'm moving back to the suburbs to live with my parents. How do you cope when nothing seems to be working out?	For me, video games distract me from such issues. It can take some effort to get into, but you can usually get into a "zone" where you're just completely involved in the game and distracted from whatever is troubling you. I find this works better than stuff like inbetween jobs and the like that others have suggested, presumably since video games can leave you without any downtime and are actually fun as opposed to just work. Although it probably comes down to personal preferences, too.	It always passes. It fucking sucks, sometimes for a while, but eventually it just becomes a memory of "that shit sucked, glad it's over now." I know that's cliche advice but it's totally true. A year and a half ago I moved across the states after a breakup, sold my house, and had to love with my parents for a month before getting into my apartment. I remember being in Butte Montana and I've never felt so alone in my life. Now I am gainfully employed, own a home in Seattle, have an awesome little dog, and am planning to get engaged. "This, too, shall pass," is solid advice.
How many times do you text a girl before moving on?	Give her your number. Let her text you. That way you know she's interested. (Reading the post seems like she texted you first anyways) Text once. If she's interested she'll reply. If she's not interested you have no reason not to move on.	If I have already have texted her twice then I won't bother until she'll reply. If she doesn't reply then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and move on...
What is the worst thing about dating?	When the floor in your bedroom has collapsed leading down into hell and they make a huge deal over it because they're too inconsiderate to understand that the arcane arts is cheaper than running a gas furnace.	Finding out you have no connection once u meet them and still having to go through the event. (The first date) Online dating is the worst for this. Also, dating in general is very nerve racking for me if I'm genuinely interested in the person because i don't know if they're talking to other people, or if we are 'serious' as in is he just having fun or does he genuinely like me too?
Did you ever like a guy but hated the way he dressed?	He's it was my boyfriend. I taught him so well that now people at work (we work together) compliment him more than me	Married him. :) Clothes are replaceable. He has gotten somewhat better over the years but I didn't marry him for his style.
Can friends "just" cuddle?	I ain't trying to cuddle, I'm trying to fuck. The fuck would I waste my time with that shit if I don't get to bust my nut at the end.	Well, if you were in a committed relationship would you feel OK with your partner "just" cuddling with someone else? Personally I wouldn't.
What went through your mind when you saw a erect penis for the first time in person?	I'm not putting my mouth on that*. Hmm I may not even want that inside me and will just stick to getting oral. *And to this day I've been fortunate to never have.	That it was a lot higher and front-er on the body than I thought it would be. The mechanics of sex started to make a lot more sense.
Which videogame was the biggest let-down for you?	Skyrim. I'd never played an Elder Scrolls game but people kept raving about it so kuch that I picked it up. Looks bad, plays bad, has trash voice acting, boring quests, and a bland story. That's not even mentioning the technical issues...	The new Star Wars Battlefront by EA. Grew up playin I and II and the new one had 0 campaign and very few maps. I've heard it was improved a bit through DLCs but I can't imagine it's anywhere near the originals Edit: wow this got lots of attention! Honestly if they just remade BF 2 and threw in a multiplayer I would have been more than satisfied
What's something you feel strongly about, that you think no one really understands?	My intolerance to drama and those that cause it. I can't stand it and so far it has caused me to stop talking to certain family members and completely dismissed my desire to have a female in my life. My quality of life continues to go up the more people I cut out of it that cause me emotional pain. Selfish, stubborn, whatever it's called, I like my life more now than I ever have. Even with all the illness that has been coming up.	How much I can second guess myself and think I am a complete shitbag. Many times I hate myself for tiny, near insignificant things I do. I tell my friends sorry for things I did that I feel were mean or embarrassing, and they don't even remember it.
I've noticed that a lot of women women prefer reading/imagining their porn over watching it. Why do you think this is? And why do you think there such a strong preference among men towards visual porn?	I think women get more into how a guy makes them feel and men are more about how the chick looks.	A lot of visual porn is not made for women, the majority of it actually is not made for women. It's made with the goal of getting guys off and often isn't appealing because it comes across as fake, or the actors are unattractive, or the close ups are showing body parts that I'm not aroused by.

What do you continue guiltily doing even though you know it's bad for you/the environment/other people/animals?	Eat beef. I don't feel guilty about eating meat but I do feel guilty about eating beef although I do it like couple times a month and in small amount, still. EDIT: I should have written I don't feel guilty about eating meat *for the environment*. I don't feel comfortable eating any meat, the beef gives extra guilt.	Long showers. Particularly when I'm feeling anxious, or had a bad day, or have things I need to think through, there is nothing like a long, hot shower. I've gotten at least somewhat better-there were times in high school when I sed to take two a day.
What are things that you cut out of your life (or cut back on) that made you better/happier?	Excess money. Work to live, don't live to work. Don't accumulate or hoard money for a "future" that probably isn't going to happen anyway. Retirement, owning a home, etc etc, it's all bollocks.	I stopped drinking during the week because it was making me tired and not motivated to do things like clean the house. So far it's been very positive.
Women who weren't that keen on kids, but ended up having them, how do you feel about it now?	Just for the record, you don't have to have kids. Don't listen to people insisting that you must, or that your life will be pointless, or you'll die alone and all that other nonsense. We childfree people hear it all the time. It's your choice and your life. /r/childfree	I identified as childfree, until I found out I was pregnant and too far along to abort. We're coming up on the year anniversary of that pregnancy test, and I have a 9 month old; do that horrifying math. Adjusting to a radical life change without being able to make any choices about it was difficult. Thankfully, I've never resented my baby. I resent the hell out of my partner, but not the baby. I love her, and she's really cool, but we got the easiest baby ever. If she had been fussy or difficult, I don't know what I would have done. Kids are a lot. We're at the point in our population development that we don't need a lot more kids, so it's not like you owe humanity your uterus. If you have a choice and don't really want children, I advise against it.
Women who say "I don't get along with women"/"All my best friends are guys"--why? What's the mentality?	They've been influenced by sexism in our culture that sends the message that women are always catty, dramatic, and backstabbing. Also messages that girly things are stupid, lame, and a waste of time.	I don't say the first, but the second is true of me - and most of my friends in general tend to be guys. I have no idea why it is. I often feel intimidated or isolated from other women I meet, even if they're being friendly and inviting. I also tend to vocally share most of the same hobbies as the guys I encounter rather than the girls.
How do you get over the feeling of being fetishized?	East Asian in ethnicity. It’s not a problem being fetishized to me. Someone can have genuine interest and also are interested sexually on the side. I treat it as any other fetish, accepting it and see it as a positive contribution. I’d much rather be fetishized than have people uninterested in me because I’m not of a specific race.	It’s very frustrating. I’m a black woman so I totally understand. I think sometimes certain men see me as something to check off of their bucket list. I get to know them, follow my intuition & usually it’s not wrong. I don’t mind dating outside of my race, but when I feel like I’m just a black body part, it’s a turn off.
How often do people make snide remarks about your appearance while you're in public? What do they say?	No one does the only comment I could think was this guy randomly on a bus commenting how glad he wasn't my height. I'm 5'2 I'm pretty sure a ton of guys wants their girl this short apparently it's a fetish.	My entire life I have had a really red face. I get flushed very easily, so people will often ask about it. I never understood why someone would feel the need to comment on it and my face will inevitably get more red when they talk about it. Edit: you have no idea how great these comments have made me feel. I always thought I was alone with my insecurity. Now, I realize so many others struggle with a similar problem. Here’s to embracing our redness lol!
How would you feel about a female friend of yours asking you to be her casual date to a wedding?	Youre obviously hoping that he will read romance into the invitation here, I guess I would take it at face value though.	People do that sort of thing all the time. Just call him or shoot him a text asking if he wants to go with you. Edit: A word.
I'm going on vacation to Hawaii this Friday. What things have you forgotten to pack for vacation so I can learn from your mistakes?	I once forgot shoes on a summer road trip. My flip flops were bothering me so I took them off to finish loading the car, then somehow forgot to put them back on before leaving. They were the only shoes I'd planned on wearing.	Something at least a little dressy. On our honeymoon, my husband didn't bring long pants. We couldn't get into some places because we were too casual. It's easier being a woman, just bring a dress, but nonetheless, make sure you've got something that'll look decent if necessary.
Men who are drifting apart from your circle of friends, for whatever reason, how do you cope?	I'm drifting apart from the remaining core of my teenage friends (am now 31). Drifting apart because I am married and have a good career, and they sit on their asses gaming and smoking weed. I'm coping just fine.	I do a lot of shit with my grillfiend and family. It doesn't bother me, but then I've always been more introverted anyway and always felt I had to sort of force it a bit. Probably a bit different when you're older. I don't get invited to parties or big social events any more, but I'm sort of past that stage anyway.
do you have any male friends you would date if they asked?	No. I don't befriend men I'm interested in. If I'm single, I ask them out, if they're interested we date, if they're not they say "no" and I do not seek a friendship with them. If I'm in a relationship I keep them as only acquaintances, I don't accept invites to things from them and only hang out in group contexts where they are brought along by mutual friends.	That's how my husband and I got together. We were very good friends and just always had that spark. Finally got together and it's been wonderful ever since.
Men who don't use Facebook, do you feel like you are missing out? If so what are some examples? If not, why?	No. Why what? The question doesn't even make sense -- you wouldn't ask somebody why they felt like they weren't missing out just because they didn't shit in a porta-potty.	Nope, I much prefer face to face conversation and talking on the phone. I have a small number of close friends, which is good enough for me.
It's late night, dark outside, and you're walking on an empty sidewalk. I'm walking behind you for a pretty long time because I'm going in the same direction, do I speed up my pace to walk past you or slow down considerably?	Protocol is that you walk as fast or slow as you want. If she's uncomfortable then she might cross to the other side. I don't have to prove that I'm not a rapist.	If you're going to stay behind me please just keep your distance. I'm probably going to start walking faster whatever you do. If you come speeding up behind me because you're about to pass I'm going to find it initially alarming and then be glad that you're in front of me once you've passed. If you crossed the street I would find that reassuring but recognise it's not your responsibility to do that.
How can I be sexually assertive without it coming off as pushy?	There's an app called text now. Its free and its basically a new number you can use whenever you have internet. Give him that number. Hook up that way.	If he's within the 90% of average guys, he'll have no problem with you going after him. From a guy's perspective, I wish more women would be comfortable making the first move. Write your number down for him, and say "Call me, let's have drinks/dinner/whatever". You don't have to say you want the D... he'll know. Tackle him at the knees when you meet.
Women of reddit, what's the strangest thing a man had ever said to you on a date?	As a male reading these it makes me cringe so very hard. I've said some of the dumbest, most inappropriate shit all in the name of making a girl smile. Weird happens, it can be extreme but please remember that some of these guys are face-palming at themselves too. Either way, keep them coming!	I was briefly seeing this guy, and we went on a camping date once. While walking back to our campsite, we came across some random dude camper, and I talked to him about cheddar cheese. My date flipped his shit and yelled at me. He "asked" (in an angry, raised-voice manner) who the guy was, how I know him, and why I was talking to him. I told him I had no idea who the guy was, but that we were just talking about cheese. He insisted that I knew the guy and had slept with him in the past. Definitely the strangest thing that a dude has ever said to me on a date.
What's the most shocking thing you've had to explain to a significant other?	My fiance didn't know you had to make a noise when kissing. He thought the little noise was just automatic.	That cats do not, in fact, like being vacuumed. Context: >Husband: "Wow, the cats are REALLY shedding a lot!" >Me [heading out the door to go to work] : "Yup, we're gonna have to vacuum them, haha!" (Later, I return from work. Husband is COVERED in claw marks, and comes over to me wide eyes) >"Honey, the cat does NOT like being vacuumed!" ...I was speechless for a good 30 seconds before nearly busting a gut laughing. I had to explain that I was JOKING and OBVIOUSLY trying to vacuum a cat- much less trying to vacuum a cat *while holding it*- is a terrible idea! Good times, good times. lol
My female roommate walked topless into my room last night. How do I approach this?	Pulled due to the shit flinging and slapfighting. Did this *really* need to turn into an argument where we report comments for disagreeing?	Pulled due to the shit flinging and slapfighting.

How do you feel about tv commercials that make men look stupid and women smart and superior?	Doesn't nearly offend me as much as portraying more black men in advertising than constitute the ethnic proportions in society. I mean, yeah, I get you're trying to prove your company values "diversity" but you're not exactly helping things by focusing too much on a single ethnicity to achieve that goal.	Home Depot has always impressed me by being able to portray both sexes as badass doers. It's really their entire marketing strategy, but they play both genders equally. I get the whole "powerful" mom/female tactic that some companies use, sometimes men look stupid by comparison, I get that. It's hard to build a narrative like this in 30 seconds or less without tilting the scales of intelligence a little to the extreme side, but there's a limit. What annoys me, and I say this as someone who will completely forget about the commercial the moment it ends, is when the husband looks hopeless and like a full retard, like he's a danger to his children. In an age where the father/husband role is constantly being undermined through gatekeeping and such it bothers me when commercials portray the husband as having a negative influence in a family.
Single guys who live alone, what is your life like?	A lot of the reasoning in this thread is pretty damn pathetic. "I can sleep as late as I want..." What?	When I'm in a relationship it's great, because it provides a great place to hang out, have sex, etc, and also a buffer when you need space and want to be alone. For your question, when I'm single (which I am now), it can get very lonely in a hurry if you let it. You have to fill your social calendar. Meet with friends and family at least 3-4 times a week. I play basketball once a week, coach youth sports, and hit the gym 5 times a week. I always text friends to hang out, and I visit my parents at least once a week. If you don't do these things, you will find yourself on the couch watching netflix most of the time and you will be alone with your thoughts a lot. You have to keep busy.

I'm going to college at the ripe old age of 23, what are some tips, tricks and do's and dont's that I should be aware of?	I can't tell you what I learned from school But I could tell you a story or two Um yea of course I learned some rules Like don't pass out with your shoes on And don't leave the house till the booze gone And don't have sex if shes too gone When it comes to condoms put two on Then tomorrow night find a new joint	Don't tell other freshmen you're over 21 unless you want a bunch of classmates asking you to buy them alcohol all the time
If your SO, after a fight, demands you to sleep on the couch, do you?	It's called reverse sexism. Girls want equality, but still want us to do all the "manly" things like this too. That being said, if you aren't farting up a storm, or snore like a snorlax, you should really talk out the issue, or agree that you'll talk about it in the morning, then go to sleep, in the same bed.	She doesn't do that and I wouldn't do it if she did. When she tries doing it herself, I go out and fix the problem before going to bed so we sleep in the same bed. Last time she tried I came out and laid on top of her while she was on the recliner and said, "THIS IS YOUR DECISION, YOU'VE DONE THIS TO US!" Which made her cry/laugh in frustration. Then we communicated a little better and resolved the issue.
To those who have lost a significant amount of weight; how has your life changed?	Not sure what qualifies as 'significant,' but I gained a little weight when I got married, so it was significant to me. Mostly, my body and healthy and clothing and performance changed for the better. It made me realize how simple losing weight is, and how CICO, for the vast vast majority of people, is the only way to lose weight, and I gained weight because I ate/ drank too much. My life changed because I now weigh, and barring a crisis or being immobile, will always be a thin, healthy, trim weight and not gain weight again, and having that control over my life and body feels really, really good	People started noticing my personality. Prior, my coredefining features were, apparently, that I was fat and very busty. Conversations with women revolved around it, people accused anyone I spoke to of only speaking to me because of my breasts. People would describe me to others not by my personality but by my body. "Oh, awallpapergirl? She's Sherri's best friend. Big girl. Huge tits." I felt invisible. When I lost weight I suddenly was more than a body*. I cried in the bathroom at work when I heard someone describe me as, "you know, the really smiley one!" I lost weight and suddenly I was more than my figure. I'm built very Jessica Rabbit-y now, but somehow my sexuality these days is a sidenote. I'm allowed to be a person.
Has your SO ever asked you something, out of mere curiosity, which made you feel insecure?	I asked my bf if he watches porn and it was like pulling teeth getting him to answer! I LOVE porn, he knows this info.... He does, he says, but why he's embarrassed, I'll never know	Not my SO yet, but on our 1st date she asks whether I've been in a relationship before, and then when I say no she asks why not. Shit made me so insecure and nervous.
Whats the most fucked up thing you've ever done?	If I even thought of wanting to cheat on my boyfriend I would be questioning why we are together in the first place. And break it off with him.	I was a bad kid as a young teen, like 12-14. I stole cash money out of my grandma's purse a few times. My grandma, the nicest woman I've ever known who only ever cared about taking care of everyone, and especially me, whom she cared for when my mom couldn't be a stay-at home mom anymore because money was tight, who made me spaghettio's in my favorite bowl with the handle and bought be tons of paper and pencils and crayons and markers and always encouraged me to develop my art. Who plastered her kitchen with my drawings. Honestly, I probably wouldn't draw as good as I do now if not for her. She died before I got myself straightened out. The best I can do now is aspire to be as much like her as I can.
This sounds silly, but does anyone else here worry they might be infertile because you've never become accidentally pregnant?	The topic reminded me of [this](https://i.imgur.com/SP2vAmS.png). I could swear there was an actual comic of it, does anyone have a source?	Yes! I feel this way too. My doctor assures me I've had no fertility concerns but the paranoia is definitely there.
Ladies of Reddit, what are some societal norms you and your SO break because it makes both of you happy?	PDA. Lots of it all the time. Not just handholding; full on making out in public, hands all over each other, etc.	I currently am a stay at home mom, but we have this weird silent agreement where when we go out in public with the baby he is the care giver 98% of the time. It's mostly to give me a break, but he also loves how pissy looking the older generations get when they see him and not me.
In honour of Sean Spicer, what's your most embarrassing public speaking moment?	Not really public speaking, but I once said a friend's parent had her chest pushed down a bit because I saw it in an Asterix comic when younger without realising what it actually meant. Now I do, I will never be able to live that down.	At the end of my senior year of college I had to give a presentation on my thesis for one of my majors. I launched into a detailed analysis of Kant's influence on the evolution of studies/theories relating to epistemology. Then, I saw my major advisor stick his hand up above his head. I smiled and returned his air-high-five as I continued my presentation. Turned out, he was just signaling how much time I had left.
What was the most memorable way a girl approached you?	Memorable but not in a good way. I was a 215 lb powerlifter at the time, but I was also lean. So alot of women would check me out a little or comment in my size. I never liked that attention. I was in a convenience store getting some coconut water on my way to play ball hockey, so I was in my tight athletic clothes. Lady came up and said "wow, do you play in the NFL? You look like a linebacker" as a way of flirting. I just looked at her, said "well that's a reach, lady" paid for my stuff and walked away. I'm 5'9 so no one that knows anything about football would think I'm in the NFL, not as a linebacker for sure.	A girl came up to me while I was at a brewery with some friends and says, “hey you have a sticker on your back, did you know that?” I feel my back, no sticker. She proceeds to put a sticker on my back and says really quickly “and now you have my number too”, then runs off to be with her friends again.
Does media coverage of extreme feminism ideals make you afraid to approach women?	I don't think it's terribly extreme to not be interested in dating a total stranger I just met at the store in the check out line. I don't think it's creepy necessarily, just not something I'm willing to do. Talk to me sure, but I will not go on a date with you.	It's affected me - going to social dances is a common answer given when guys ask where to meet women. But after reading a lot about how women feel like they just want to dance and not be hit on (both in the media and my Facebook feed), I gave up on that option. I never approached women on the street or in grocery stores, so nothing changed there (will probably stop me in the future though).
A random topic came up last night about Male Rape and my group of friends thought it was a joke and non-relevant. Has any other guy actually experienced this?	I think you would have to be delusional to not believe that rape is more biased towards women than men. That does not mean we should be dismissive when it does happen to men but distorting reality is not the way to solve problems.	I like how in these discussions, they assume the man is being raped by a woman. If you brought up prison rape, or a man raping another man, everyone would agree because "men can only rape." A good friend of mine was raped when he was younger. An older (female) teenager performed oral sex on him without his consent. It sounds ridiculous, even to me, but hearing him talk about it - it was totally sexual abuse. He didn't want it at all and she said she would tell others he raped her if he said no.
What are your thoughts on hunting?	Not a fan of it and I won't participate in it. I'm well aware I can kill something. I don't want to. I don't see personal value in killing something. I can understand the need if food isn't readily available or there's an issue of over-population, but short of necessity, I see nothing to be gained from the act. To be blunt, I view people who kill for fun and don't eat the animal or do so because it needs to be done, a sad sad sort.	Alabamian here. Not something I'm into myself, I'd much rather hunt paper targets at the range for an hour or two with one of those scary "assault rifles". I respect the people that do hunt though, successful hunters have to be extremely patient and their marksmanship must be excellent in order to close out their tags in a season; I admire the skill all that entails. But it's not something I could see myself going out of my way to do, too many Disney movies as a kid I guess.
Aussies of AskWomen, how are you handling the Australian Marriage Law Survey?	Everyone is quite decided on where they stand, and I feel people are entitled to their opinions. Saying that, I'm pretty confident the majority will vote "yes". I've heard of several instances where people have poked through their neighbours' mailboxes and stolen their letters, and even of postal workers who have disposed of envelopes voting a certain way, which is quite disheartening to see.	It's extremely frustrating that we even have to have this debate. And some of the things that have been said are very hurtful to the LGBT+ community. I ticked Yes.
Have you ever lost a male best friend because of his SO? If so, what happened? Did you make it up after a while?	Yes. He was annoying to begin with and he found an SO who was just as bad. Fuck that noise. Life is too short to hang out with people you don't like.	Not lost because that sounds weird to me, but I've definitely had male friends drift away once they got married or settled into a serious relationship. I think it's fine. It's expected that their wife/SO would be their priority instead of their friend (even if close friends). I don't take it personally. I would do the same to them.
Have you ever felt used during sex? Like the guy was basically just masturbating with your vagina?	No, absolutely not. I've never slept with anyone who didn't care about me and treat me with respect and mutual pleasure. One reason I don't sleep around indiscriminately, because I don't want to feel used	Yeah, I've had sex that felt kind of like that. Luckily, he realized afterwards that it had been a little too one-sided and offered to make it up to me in other ways. He was really new to sex in general, so I just considered it part of that and didn't think much of it. He was a really nice guy, and quickly corrected the problem.
What are some things that are sexually biased that people don't talk about?	Women have more earth-shattering orgasms and it's fucking not fair. It's not fair fucking either. What do we want, female orgasms, when do we want them Now!	The Smurfette Principle is something that shows up in a lot of shows and movies. Basically, if there's a group of characters, they all have their "thing"-- someone's the smart one, someone's the funny one, etc. The lone female character is the girl one. The boys are individuals, and the girl is just not a boy.
When looking for someone who is wife material opposed to just girlfriend material, what stands out?	Good donestic skills and a sefless attitude about doing them. Cooking and cleaning and all that stuff. Id only marry someone who took care of all that stuff for me so that i could spend more time on my career.	I definitely differentiate. Generally, I look for things like maternal instincts, not being hectic, and matching kinks. A solid career and life choices are good bonuses here too. Sure the polyamorous stripper who's travelling to Asia soon is awesome, but the girl who's working steady and getting her nursing degree done? I can deal with things like wildly different and crazy for a girlfriend, but it's not wife material. Also, I'm sure I'll hit a point in the next couple years where I'm pretty much needing the girlfriend to have wife potential. I'm already looking at things like young partying girls as fads, and while it looks exciting, I kind of just want someone who knows how to cook and cuddle, and maybe wants to have my kids someday.
Men of reddit, how do you guys approach a girl at a party?	Check out r/seduction for some better advice. Don't have a canned line that you use on everyone. Do it as soon as you think about it and don't give yourself excuses not to. Do not approach on an outcome basis i.e. because you want her number, kiss her, fuck her. Only approach because you want to. Talk about whatever you want. Be playful, sarcastic, unpredictable. Touch early and often, don't greet with a handshake always a hug. That's basically the TL/DR of seddit	"Hey :) How's your night? I'm BFG *shake hands/cheers drinks*, how do you know [party thrower]?" and then you should be good to just chat. If you're not getting any vibe from her you can always finish your drink and excuse yourself.
Ladies making over $100k per year, what do you do?	I have a question. I am still in school looking at going in to Child life specialist getting my masters in it as well. What can I expect to get salary-wise? Also is anyone here a Child Life Specialist? Thanks	Nurse Practitioner. If you are a nurse, I highly urge you to go back for your masters degree. There is all this chatter about "there won't be any jobs" but I'm telling you, nurse practitioners are about to be in high demand and you will forever have a job, just like nurses will.
What fantasy did you share with your SO that shut your relationship down? Or, what fantasy did your SO have that made you nope the fuck out?	Apparently not wanting kids was a fantasy. I called it good judgement. Relationship didn't last much longer. The next one had wedding fever. $10,000 dress, white ponies or some shit. No way. A wedding shouldn't cost more than a grand or two, anything else is just a waste of money. Insult to injury, I am not getting married to anyone. So that relationship went nowhere as well.	Not a SO but a fuck buddy. He told me he was seriously into pain, like black-out level pain. He loved that it made him feel like an animal. A while back, while out in the woods a stray bullet went through the outside of his thigh. I asked him a few days later how the wound was healing up. He said it was infected. I asked why and he said it was because he'd jerk off and finger fuck his bullet hole. Haven't hooked up with him since.
What is the most misunderstood part about your job?	I don't have a "real" job. I'm a stay at home mom. Obviously, everyone just assumes I sit around all day. Sure, there are days where I actually do but it's not like anyone else works 24/7... I get "I wish I could stay at home every day! Must be nice" type of comments a lot. It's just really ignorant and demeaning to have everyone assume you do nothing. I take care of my family...I'm my daughters teacher. I'm everyones cook and maid. Sometimes I feel like I forget what it's like to interact with adults. Have real conversations that don't involve animals, colors, or the abc's. That's the hardest part for most people but I don't mind too much. No, my job isn't hard but it's not lounging around eating snacks and binge watching tv all day.	Pathologists are indeed doctors. Autopsy is nothing like CSI, Bones, Investigative Discoveries or whatever other crime show you've seen on TV.?
What statements about "what women really want" are you tired of hearing?	Everyone, it's okay to let someone's statement about their own experiences stand, without attempting to change their mind or tell them how you don't like their *lived experience*. Seriously it's fine to just read rather than try and debate, derailing the topic.	Everyone, it's okay to let someone's statement about their own experiences stand, without attempting to change their mind or tell them how you don't like their *lived experience*. Seriously it's fine to just read rather than try and debate, derailing the topic.
Do you have designated "period panties"?	Nope. I don't see the point. I've never ruined a pair, any stains wash off. And I wouldn't care about stains anyway, I don't have any fancy or expensive pairs.	I mostly have black underwear, but I feel like all of my panties eventually become period panties. It's the natural lifecycle.
Why is it so common for women to say that they don't get along with "other women"?	Sexism, mostly. It's about being the cool girl, who gets along with the boys, because girls are soooooo much drama and bla bla bla.	I wouldn't say that I don't get along with other women, but I have more guy friends than girl friends. I think it's because I see other women being so wonderful and feminine and having great fun with other girls and I feel a bit intimidated. I'm a bit awkward and shy and afraid to approach them in case they talk about how much of a loser I am (even though I know they won't really). I'd love to be one of the girls, I just don't consider myself cool enough yet.
They say the strongest men aren’t afraid to show emotion, even for something good. What’s something positive that gets you all welled up?	Reading or hearing stories of people fighting to the death, especially in situations they knew were doomed. I can't imagine the privilege of dying in combat. There is nothing in this world I am more passionate for than dying in combat for a greater cause. Nothing else makes me feel like that.	My niece and nephew have this innate ability to make me tear up at times. I remember one day after losing my first job after college, I just crashed on the couch. I was already falling apart inside. My niece and nephew were over at my parents house, so he just curled up on my couch. “What wrong?” “Just a bad day, bud” He runs away, comes back with a cookie. “These make me happy. They make you happy” He’s almost four now, and still gets me every so often.
Ladies who were convinced they would be single forever but found someone: What is your story?	I didn't think it was going to happen. I dated 2 guys and it didn't really feel like my thing. I was almost to the point of thinking I was asexual or aromantic. I met my husband first year university. He had followed his girlfriend to the area. She was going to a near-by university. We hit it off as friends. But he ended up asking me out several months after she broke it off. And the rest is history.	the internet. i found my (now) husband, who is from the same town as me, went to the same university as me and has a number of acquaintances in common with me (but whom i had NEVER come across in 30 years) on the internet.
how important is food compatibility to you when it comes to relationships ?	Very. I eat a lot of foods, and expect the same. I am not vegan, and have a hard time accommodating that (my BFF is vegan, and we go out to like, one place) although vegetarian I can usually handle. I also like to travel, and if one is not willing to eat local and order off a menu one cannot read, gtfo.	I'm a vegetarian and my SO isn't, but he doesn't mind eating vegetarian meals sometimes and I don't mind handling/cooking meat. When we go out for, say, Thai food, he prefers curries and I like noodles, but we're both willing to eat the same types of cuisines/neither of us is picky, so it's fine. And I love cooking so it's okay with me that he isn't a big fan. One thing that is important to me is enjoying food—I like to go to restaurants as a fun thing to do, I like to try new foods, I like to cook elaborate meals, etc. Someone who only ate for sustenance wouldn't be compatible.
Thinking back on an unhealthy relationship, what were the biggest red flags/signs early on that you missed?	Both of the unhealthy relationships I had started out with me being treated like a princess, showered in gifts and made to feel so unbelievably special. They both told me they loved me far too early. However, these two individuals also worked to isolate me from friends and family.	I've posted this before in other threads. He would be extremely mean to people (family, friends, not just me) and brush it off as teasing, make the person feel like they had no sense of humor. But if he was teased in even a mild way, he'd flip out. It sounds small, but that was the first sign that something was really wrong.
What's the most random missed connection you've had with a girl?	I worked at H&M in a big shopping mall for a short period when I was like a freshman in college. The chicks that I worked with would browse the missed connections section of craigslist. One day when I came in for my shift like 3 of these chicks ambushed me and showed me a missed connection post that someone made online that described me to a t. I followed up on the post and actually met the chick in person for coffee but she turned out to be fat so I didn't pursue anything further.	At a bar in Manhattan drinking with friends, random girl walks up to me and says, "excuse me, you are very good looking." "Awe, thank you!" I say, as if she were 12 and just complimented my shoes. An awkward silence and she walks away. I didn't realize until my friends told me that she was probably flirting. Now, six year later, I think, "probably?!!" I've never been so flirted with in my life and I was clueless.
Women who have gone through menopause, what was it like for you?	I am 45, I had to have emergency surgery just over a year ago due to an ovarian torsion. I had a large cyst on my right ovary, bit my left ovary had a huge cyst that flipped my ovary. The surgeon removed all of my left and 75-80% of my right ovaries. He opted to leave me the small amount of the one in order to not pit me on HRT. I went from having very regular easy going periods to holy shit is this for real so heavy I can't leave the house periods. They are irregular to say the least and in the past year I have had three of them last over 30 days! I have mood swings and hot flashes and really hate being a woman lately. And from what I understand this is just the beginning? Ugh.	Not me personally, sorry, but my dad and I have discussed the fact that my mother after menopause is no longer moody and doesn't lash out at people for innocuous reasons. My mother was a seriously difficult person to grow up with, mood swings is an understatement. Never crossed my mind that her temperament had that much to do with hormones. She's generally just far more agreeable and seems more content now. I wouldn't go as far as to say "happy" but she isn't so incredibly miserable with life anymore. It kills me to think that she had to live being that unhappy for ~40 years.
Ladies who love to be alone: how did you get used to living with your SO?	we slept in the same bed together for our first semester as a couple. i learned to not mind his presence, or at least not "interpret" it the same way as the presence of others. i hope that makes sense.	Being an introvert means that other people wear me out. But the closer I became to my husband the less he was “other people” and the more he felt like an extension of myself. By the time we were living together, spending time with him around became a perfectly acceptable form of “alone time.” There’s time we spend together, and there’s time we spend in the same house.
A cute girl grabbed my arm and said I was very funny after I performed improv. My co-workers claim that that was a prime meet cute moment. Any advice on how to go from "thank you for the compliment" to "may I have your number"?	Just say 'if you thought that was funny, wait 'til you see what I'm like in bed. When are you free?'	"Thanks! What's your name? What brought you to the show tonight? We're getting drinks after the show, would you and your friends like to come along?"
Men of Reddit, do you think babies are cute?	Babies are creepy little demi-humans. If they weren't needed for the perpetuation of our species I'd say to throw them all in a mass grave.	Newborns? No. Nine to fifteen months? Love them. They're the best kinds of people. They don't judge. They don't ask questions. They don't talk. They laugh at all of your stupid gimmicks and quips. And if they cry, you can narrow it down to three basic needs- I'm hungry, I'm tired, I pooped.
Guys who have high sex drive but your SO has a low drive, how is it like?	It will always be up to the higher sex drive partner to "shift it down". You can't make your partner increase her sex drive without it becoming pretty rapey - it's just who they are as a person. Can you be satisfied in a relationship that gives you (considerably?) less sex than you want? Your call to make. My answer would be *nope*. I would end up cheating on her, which is even shittier for both of us.	It sucks. One of you will have to make changes. You'll either have to accept fewer sexual encounters or she'll have to try to do more. That is if you stay together.
Men of Reddit, can you feel when a girl is having an orgasm while you’re inside of her? Does it feel substantially wetter/better afterwards?	If you can't feel her orgasming from inside you aren't giving her orgasms. Straight up. Or you've killed all the nerves in your dick from death grip masturbation. Or you have a small dick. Take your pick.	Why is the top answer not "It depends entirely on the woman and the quality of the orgasm." ? Seriously. I've been with some women who it felt live a water faucet had been turned on the second it happens. Some give zero indication whatsoever but then just tell you that they came. Just leaving you confused and trying to make it happen again. Some will have muscle contractions that you can feel around your guy. (Had an ex that did a lot of kegals, worried that she could rip it off) It's just depends. And 2 orgasms are seldom alike. In general of my experiences, it gets a bit tighter and a lot wetter. Edit: I guess it is the top answer.
Have you ever been creeped out by somebody you were attracted to? What happened?	He was hot and charming when I met him, but then he invited me on a weekend trip with him a day after we exchanged numbers. Stopped talking to him after that. That’s creepy.	He showed up at my house in the middle of the night. He intended this to be the first time for us to meet. I never gave him my address.
Just got rejected again for an interview I thought I nailed. Anyone else stuck in the hellish underworld of unemployment?	If there were younger applicants, the employer will pick them to pay less. Everything is about how they can part with the least amount of money.	Bring your resume to temp agencies! They love getting people with degrees because most of the people who walk in the door have a high school diploma at best. You'll have a rep who works with you to suss out your best skills and connect you with job openings. I've gotten both my post-college jobs from starting as a temp.
Does your SO's family dislike you? If so, how do you handle it?	My SO's family loves me more than they love him I think. When I mentioned to his mom we we're dating (we had been friends long before that and his mom got drunk a lot and told me how much she wanted him to be with me) she cried and announced it to the whole family.	They dislike me and don't want my SO and I together due to my illness(es). SO and I have gone to the psychologist over it to know how to handle it. He can't cut them completely out of his life, but I have after some seriously bad shit on their part. We've made sure that we're both on the same page, otherwise it's just useless trying to have a relationship with someone that doesn't respect me or our relationship (as his family has done exactly that). He's decided on his own that no one in his family is coming to our wedding since they don't respect our relationship nor want us together.
To women who have close male friends, have they ever made comments about women (appearances, certain traits, etc.) that has made you uncomfortable? If so, how did you deal with it?	Yeah. If they're really close friends and I think they'd be receptive, I may let them know that what they said made me uncomfortable for some reason, just so they know. But I also know that not everyone is going to take hearing that well, and so I will sometimes just keep my mouth shut and deal with it internally. Yeah, we're all part of a patriarchal system.....	Occasionally someone will make a generalisation that I personally don't agree with, and I feel horribly out of place when they say oh I'm different. It's like they're trying to put the "not like other girls" label on me. I remember for example a friend of mine who was going to propose to his girlfriend. And he was like, "Well I got to spend X on a diamond" and I was like, "Have you actually asked what she wants?" And he dismissed that saying it would ruin the surprise and all women wanted a diamond ring. There's me with my unconventional non diamond ring which I reminded him of and he's like "nah you're different". In the end his fiance wanted an emerald!
Any other mid-20's men feeling left out and tired of people settling down?	It is rough stuff. But I priomise you you made the correct decision. Wait 5-7 years and half the people you know will already be divorced. Imagine how awesome it'll be for you to be in your 30s with a career, money in the bank, no debts and no baggage from a failed marriage. The grass is always greener, but your doing it right!	You're still a very young man, but your post almost sounds like someone my age, (63), sadly lamenting about having lived a life wasted on poor choices and bad decisions. I don't know how tied down to your job you are, how passionate you are about your work, or how flexible it allows you to be. I do know that if you want to spend a month on the sun drenched beaches of Thailand, or Bali there is nothing to prevent you from enjoying that experience. Believe me, as someone who started a family *very* young, there are many things you can do that your married friends cannot, and the options dwindle rapidly when kiddies start pitter-pattering into your life. I guess I'm just trying to point out that there are many, huge advantages to being single, young, healthy and free! The only limits are those you impose on yourself.
Men who didn't want kiddos and had them anyway, which of your original concerns with having kids came true? Which didn't?	I thought when I had kids that I would cease to exist as an individual. I actually feel 1000 times more alive. When I meet an older adult that never had kids I kinda feel sorry for them.	All of them. No personal time, super expensive. Constant attention. No more vacations for the first 3-5 years. Destroyed house. Everyone in your business telling you how to parent.Your relationship with your wife will be eroded and tested to the breaking point due to a lack of time with each other.
What is the worst way autocorrect has ducked you over?	I've sent things to my SO before, and I know I've trusted autocorrect too much when I get "????" in return. There have been times I've had to re-type the whole conversation before because I just trusted the phone. Those times are becoming much less often. LOL, Sorry Love, I'm working on it!	The worst one - that I think is funny - was when I texted my kid sister thanking her for a birthday card. Autocorrect somehow took "thanks for the birthday card" to "thanks for the BDSM card"
What gender stereotypes do you see in books, games, tv and movies that you have never witnessed in real life?	How come vagina owners in TV shows never get their periods? Or deal with fluctuating hormones? Or taking hormone replacement medication? It's as if all that operates in a magical peaceful vaccum when realistically it likes to get into raging dumpster fire mode quite often.	It’s either all girly-girl or all tomboy for female characters and there is no in between. It’s two dimensional and boring.
I can't fathom what it's like to be loved romantically. Could you describe it to me?	Its security, peace, happiness, and exuberance. To have that mutual honesty and trust and care is the most freeing thing in the world, and I wouldn't give it up for anything. He makes me happy, he's my best friend and my soulmate. I just feel so content. That no matter what happens to me in the course if my life that I'll always be okay. Being selfless with your love for someone else is so satisfying and beautiful. Everyone deserves that slice of heaven. EDIT: Plus there's no judgement and 100% acceptance and for someone to feel so strongly with you with all your flaws is awesome.	Safe. It makes me feel safe. Which is strange for me because I always feel on edge. It makes all of my running thoughts calm and my body relax. At first, it gives me a kind of euphoria, but as it gets comfortable, it starts to fit right, it becomes a safe feeling.
What do you think of women slapping men on television shows?	I don't mind it at all, because it's not like a girl slapping a guy is really going to do much to him, compared to the other way around. People saying that a girl slapping a guy is the same as a guy slapping a girl are completely delusional to the physical differences between men and women.	I find it unfortunate that it's considered socially acceptable for a woman to hit a man when he says or does something (non-physical) that she doesn't like, and that a woman doing that in TV or movies is frequently portrayed as justified. The idea that a man can hit a woman for some offense is rightly seen as a relic of the 1950s, and there's no reason that it should be acceptable with the genders flipped. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a [video campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJXAallsyY) aimed at changing attitudes on this.
Men, What makes you decide to be single?	"Decide" Mmmkay lets go with that. So let's look at pros and cons to being in a relationship and if it's worth the time, money, and effort. Rewards: possible sex. Possible future awesome wife. Possible kids. Almost guaranteed good times. Post-marriage marriage/kids tax write offs. Slim chance at getting a sugar momma. Risks: possible STDs. Possible no return on investments. Possible future shitty or abusive wife. Probable divorce, with likely outcome of kids going to her custody. Meanwhile I'm happy doing what I already do everyday. I feel like it's not worth actively searching for a relationship. If I want a family and I feel financially comfortable I'll adopt a kid and parent my own way.	I haven't really "decided" to be single. I am pretty happy as is and if you're not adding to my happiness, then I don't really think I need to make an investment of time into a relationship. That sounds super pretentious I suppose, but I feel like unless I really enjoy hanging with the other person, it's not worth the effort. Would I like to be in a relationship just to be in a relationship to fulfill human interaction needs? No. Would I like to be in a relationship because I value the other person and they enhance my day to day life in ways I can't alone? Ab-so-fucking-loutely.
How do I tell our upstairs neighbor that their bed is super squeaky and we can hear it every time they bang?	All most of the answers down below are going to do is to either piss your neighbour off, or egg them on and fuel their ego. I had a neighbour complain to me about my wife and I when we first got together. Ignored them completely. Either start having your own sex and ignore the neighbours, or get yourself some ear plugs. It's not their fault you're not having sex. Trust me, your neighbour knows how squeaky that bed is, and DNGAF. In regards to the squeaks.	>Thinking about leaving a can of WD-40 at their door with a note that says "for your bed." Literally perfect
What is a small issue that you're very passionate about?	Gum. Gum should be banned. It serves no purpose and makes every public walkway look like shit. PS, you can just swallow it and nothing bad happens, asshole.	People leaving shopping carts all over grocery store parking lots. It's a constant reminder of how fucking lazy everyone is, and that I hate them.
Women of Reddit: what is your libido REALLY like?	I find it weird how many people here are saying that their libido goes away when they're single. I've been single my whole life. Holy shit, I'd give anything to not be constantly horny almost every day.	Either 0 or 100 depending on various factors that I haven't figured out yet. Either I have no interest, or I'm actively trying to undress my partner at every opportunity. I think part of it is hormonal but the rest of it is a mystery.
How would you feel if a guy you liked slept with your friend?	Would tell both of them to fuck off permanently. I have no time for people like that and their shit.	What is my relationship with the guy? If he's just some guy from the other side of the office who I think is attractive then I'd be like... High five, hope you had fun. If it was a guy I was friendly/friends with who I was growing feelings for then I would be kind of jealous and sad. I mean, that wouldn't be my friend's fault though. I'd probably pretend to be fine with it. You don't get to claim ownership over someone just because you like them.
What type of affection do you like from the person you're seeing/with?	Being tugged into her warm chest, full of her scent and love… That’s especially necessary when things are bad. That’s when she’s being mama instinctually, and it’s the *sssssexiest*.	Head pats/scratches, back rubs, kisses (mouth, neck, forehead, cheek), cuddling, hugs Also just like compliments or flirting. Anything from "youre really cute" to "i want you to tear my clothes off" works.
Women who have felt disrespected and/or burnt out at work due to the disrespect. How have you dealt with it?	I put up with it for a little while, but it slowly got worse and HR refused to do anything about it. So, I quit as soon as I could.	I left the job as soon as i could. I didn't want to waste time and effort on people who don't see my value.
What can a woman do to make herself more attractive to you?	Don’t use too much makeup. A tiny bit is attractive but I’ve always found too much make up is artificial	In all honesty, some physical attraction is necessary, but what qualifies as attractive is largely subjective. If you put any small level of thought and preparation into your appearance, you'll be fine. I'll ask you out the first time based on appearance. If you're 6/10 on my personal scale, I want to go on a date with you. What will keep me coming back, though, is personality. Are you fun? Do you seem to be a well-rounded person? Do we have interests in common? Don't worry about going over the top with hair/makeup/etc. If you can be a confident and fun partner, you'll be incredibly attractive to everyone.
Men who found love after giving up on the idea of ever finding someone, what's your story?	My story is that I don't love any one person. Last girlfriend was almost 10 years ago. I've been casually dating since then. If I get bored or a girl does something disrespectful I cut her out of my life. To me, there are more important things in life than pussy. "Bitches come and go" - J Cole	I'm a pretty ugly guy and also messed up my body further by being obese through puberty. Being bullied in school and seeing my parents destroy themselves in their unhappy marriage probably didn't help either. By my mid-twenties I had exhausted all possible venues for improving my attractiveness - I was at my best and my best was objectively unattractive. So I gave up and started just focusing on enjoy life and avoiding being depressed about loneliness - it didn't always work and sometimes I would get bouts of crippling sadness several days long. And then a little over a year ago I met someone through a friend. We had a lot of common interests and views, which was normal enough, but then it turned out she also finds me very attractive. So, I lost my virginity to her at 32 years old. We've been happily together ever since.
What actor or actress always seems to play the exact same person in all their movies?	Al Pacino! Even when he doesn't play the same character he acts like the same character. Same facial expressions and all.	Jesse Eisenberg. I don't ever feel like I'm watching a unique character. It's always just the same fast spoken, insecure, and annoying dude.
Have you ever dated a guy after he's been abused by a woman? What was that like for you?	he was verbally teased (and even slightly physically) by a bit older girls in highschool for "supposedly being cute" (his words) made him very afraid of girls so he stayed virgin for a half a decade longer, he never knew whether they mock him or is he really good looking (he is, or is now). He thought it wasn't the latter. Oh and also they teased him whether he has "giant cock" (they must've been very drunk) so he felt really bad and terribly insecure because he is average. It's weird because he now likes that I am a couple of years his senior and overall more experienced, to be precise he likes it sexually (or maybe he was conditioned to like it, not really a simple situation).	A guy I dated lost his virginity through rape when he was very young (it was an older, stronger girl who did it to him). He somehow couldn't stay in the moment during sex. He couldn't let go. He had these moments where he just had to stop all of a sudden, he had to know it was on his terms I guess. It was really sad. Made me really angry at the girl who did it to him. She took something from him that is gone probably forever. Though we didn't work out as a couple (he had all sorts of issues with commitment), we stayed friends for a pretty long time. I cared about him a lot.
Have you ever fallen for a girl who isn't your "type" and what is your story behind it?	Yeah typically I don't really have a type. Just a pretty face. A nice bum helps, but bust is far from important to me, as I am an adult. More often I'm looking for a girl who can keep a conversation up when needed but doesn't feel the need to talk all the god damn time. Stable, a full time job and isn't a bum.	My wife definitely isn't what most of my friends would consider my "type." She's quiet, introverted, a bit shy, not into partying, nor sports. I'm loud, extroverted, not shy, love a good party, and been a jock since I was in Kindergarten. But 11 years and 2 kids later we're still going strong.
In what non-abusive ways did your parents cause long term damage?	My dad cheated on my mom.. but instead of trying to work on the marriage and moving forward since he did stay for the family.. my mom beat it in to me to this day all men cheat all men are bad.. .i found out later she never had sex with my dad .. ever! No wonder he cheated... and stayed for 36 years! Now I trust knowone.. and can not get truly close to anyone.	They didn't say "I love you" much to me or my older sister, or even between themselves. A few years ago they made an effort to say it more and the first time it happened I sincerely thought one of them was deathly ill since it was so unusual. They also weren't big on physical affection or praise in general. It can be very hard for me to acknowledge when others do positive things, but I can focus with laser precision on negative things. They aren't great at standing up for me or my sister either. One side of our family is just a bunch of old fashioned, spoiled assholes and it was always "you should be the bigger person" even when I was a literal child. Edit: I'm so bummed that so many people relate to this. Group hug, y'all 🤗
What is the story you are proud of but can't just bring because it would sound like you're bragging?	I'm sleeping with 3 hot girls that have significant others, I don't bring it up because it sounds like I'm bragging and makes me look like a douchebag in some people's eyes at the same time EDIT: See what I mean?	I definitely have one of those. In February 2011, I was working for a medical software company. One of our clients was NASA. They blew up a system and it needed put back together in order to keep the schedule for the final launch of the Discovery shuttle in 10 days. I saved a shuttle launch by being really fucking good at my job.
What are the worse traditions in romantic relationships that you wish had never existed in the first place?	Divorce. The male having to do the approaching and handling the rejection. That shit is literally the most frightening thing int he world, you know.	* Expensive wedding rings and expensive weddings. * The expectations that men should pay on dates (made sense when women didn't participate in the workforce much)
As an adult, are you in the same socioeconomic class you were raised? Higher? Lower?	I was raised in an upper-middle class home with oodles of privilege in an impoverished rural community. I am now a bourgeois hipster living in a hip neighborhood in the city. I don't have the kind of income my folks had, but my lifestyle sure kicks ass.	My parents still give me money. They're upper middle class. Definitely an advantage. My friend teaches preschool (Headstart) in an inner city, those kids are so fucked. They're only 3 years old and when they play house they pretend that their partners are in jail. It's really depressing.
What are some subtle things men do that show they have a lot of confidence?	Royce da 5’9” gave me the best advice ever. “Niggas sweat bitches while bitches sweat the chill nigga in the sweats.” And that’s a motto I think we should all live by	If they have no problem when other people correct them about something. E.g. if they're stating a wrong fact, and someone corrects them, and then their reaction is polite, interested, and attentive because they're happy to improve their knowledge. Insecure people will be more likely to bluster because their ego is threatened.
What is the worst experience you've had at a hair salon?	She once accidentally cut through the wire of my £7 headphones. Was a bad move on my part in hindsight.	I have black hair. It was cut and styled in a way that made me look like Darth Vader. My lip was trembling as I thanked them and left.
Men who have worked hard to try and be attractive: Have you noticed a change in how your male friends treat you?	Some kindly told me that a good body won't make up for an ugly face. Mean, but in the end it was what they should have done as friends.	I have a friend who went through this. He's a good looking 6'4 blonde Polish dude. When I go out with him girls would try to talk to me just to get closer to him. On the other hand he seemed incredibly insecure. Constantly talking about how he's awkward in social situations, or his "failure" with girls, etc. At first I just thought, oh maybe he's not that confident. Then he started telling me how he went through a period of time where he would go to parties and hooked up with a lot of girls but ended up being really lonely because every guy saw him as a competition. Then I realized he wasn't insecure, he was just over exposing himself so that his friends can connect with him. So yeah, try being a little overly vulnerable in front of male friends.
To all the very confident women out there, what is your secret?	My confidence comes from knowing I have a certain type of influence over men. Most men are very attracted to me due to my appearance and that is a very empowering feeling.	I only concentrate on what I'm good at, what I can be proud of. What I've accomplished so far. It can be big accomplishments like renting my own apartment, it can also be small ones like showering the day before and it can be silly ones like my giant successful colony in the game 'oxygen not included'. Whenever someone tries to put me down I remember this stuff and their insults don't hit.
Why can I only masturbate to lesbian porn?	Question for the women here... why does the woman's pleasure turn you on, if you're straight? Does gay porn appeal to you? Why or why not?	Yeah, it's very common. If you search this sub for "lesbian porn," you'll see many threads about this. Lesbian porn tends to focus more on female pleasure (*authentic* or at least plausible female pleasure, not that "every woman can have screaming orgasms from penetration alone" bullshit) and it also tends to be more gentle, sensual and romantic than a lot of straight porn.
anyone else not doing anything for NY?	We're not doing anything because the kid won't sleep in. She'll still get up at the crack of dawn no matter when we went to sleep.	I'm laying in bed, next to a box of Kleenex, trying to figure out what cold medicine I'm going to take while watching The Good Wife. I'm living the crazy life.
Women of reddit at what point did you decide that your mental health required professional involvement?	When everything lost color and it all just seemed like a cold grey winter day, even on the sunniest day in the summer. All I wanted to do was lay in my bed. I functioned, barely, but as soon as I could it was back to bed.	When things I used to like doing start feeling like chores (still a giant red flag for me). So when I'd meet up with a friend I would no longer think 'yay friend' but 'Ok I'm meeting someone, should make sure I do my laundry, shit need to be at the bus at 19.00, I hope I can get home early, do I have anything to talk about?'. Also just in general not getting joy out of fun things, not being in the mood to watch a movie, read, write, because those things no longer felt rewarding but 'meh, this is ok-ish' at most.
What makes a girl boring to you?	Girls that seem like they have something to prove in terms of masculinity. I play soccer and attend a lot of women's co-rec soccer games because my SO also plays soccer and when we have dinner and stuff with other soccer people the girls are always trying to pit themselves against the guys. It's weird.	Having no personality, no hobbies, no aspirations. Also, being completely passive and unable to pull her weight in a conversation is a big one. >Is there an acceptable amount of boring that you could overlook if there is some chemistry between you? If she's boring at all then there won't be any chemistry.
What fitness level do you expect in your potential date, if you are very athletic yourself?	Is this a validation post? This smells like a validation post. I'm interested in non-overweight women who put effort into taking care of themselves; y'know, eating healthy, maybe going to the gym, at least jogging or some sort of regular physical activity. Women tend overestimate their own value/attractiveness, so I don't bother with super fit girls, since they tend to go for guys with physiques that require hormonal modifications that I'm not willing to undergo.	My ideal is that a potential SO is active in their own way. It doesn't have to be lifting weights or running (in fact, my gym time is valued alone time) - but I'd want them to be into something active; dance, gymnastics, hockey, hiking, fun runs, anything really. This, admittedly, is an ideal - not a requirement. It isn't so much that they need to be physically fit, but more that it'd make dating easier. It'd align our values and habits. They'd be more understanding why I don't drink much, eat a ton, enjoy early nights, and why I prefer to hike all day rather than go clubbing all night. That's just me though. I've never actually dated someone who was all that into fitness, and equally, I'm still attracted to those who aren't. So I wouldn't dwell on it.
What are some LPT that make your home or life more comfortable/luxurious/relaxing?	Keeping it clean makes everything feel luxurious... Another thing I like is looking at my bookshelf, keeping that maintained makes me happy.	I like to make ‘stations’. So my kitchen has a beverage station with coffee/tea/wine made to look pretty and inviting. Also it’s nice to not have to dig around for coffee and tea deep in the cabinets. My bedroom has a reading station by the bed with my reading glasses, luxury hand lotion and book I’m reading also made to look inviting. My bathtub has a bath tray with bath salts and oils on it arranged nicely. It doesn’t take long to make a station but damn... they make my house feel like a boutique hotel. Edit: Thanks so much for the gold!
Women who have done sex work, what specifically did you do and why did you do it?	I’ve sold videos of myself, been a cam girl, and been a sugar baby. I did it/do it because I can make a ridiculous amount of money. I’ve never had any negative experiences.	I was a phone sex operator for a month. I did it because I was unemployed and needed the money. The income sucked though, I think I earned like $800 that month, working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. I hated the job, and to be honest, it turned me into a misandrist and someone with a permanent chip on their shoulder, something I’m still working to get past.
What quote has had the greatest impact on how you live your life so far?	"But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all of these things will be added to you." Matthew 6:33	From a friend, that had a REALLY tough life, when I told him I didn't want to bother him with my, comparatively, minor issues. His answer: "I don't care if it's a broken nail or something more serious. What I do care about, is how you feel about it, if it's an issue for you it IS worth talking about. " -> It stuck with me ever since, and changed my way of communicating with people.
Ladies, what do you talk about with your SO?	We talk about everything and nothing. The topics that dominate many conversations are how bad or good the flatulance is and poop. Full disclosure he has ulcerative colitis.	Last night he & I discussed bar drinks (we settled on making bourbon & gingers), and then put the GOP debate on mute & guessed what they were talking about (complete with voice overs). It was SUCH a fun evening!
My SO got beat up. What can I do to help?	Challenge him to a fight and then let him win that way he can re-establish dominance and stand proudly defiant to the world. It's the only way.	The majority of streetfights I've seen involve a blatantly stronger group suckerpunching, bumsrushing or otherwise ambushing a weaker group. Basically cowards who know they're very likely to win and wouldn't start the fight otherwise. Most people even with martial art training aren't likely to win in those circumstances. It sucks, but what can you do. Winning isn't as important as sticking up for yourself.
A new dating app is launched. Instead of a photo of a person, it shows you a photo of their bedroom, car, kitchen, shoes, how they have their tea/coffee, things like that... what photo would tell you the most about someone, and would you be most interested to see to choose a potential date?	I have a thing about shoes, i think it says a lot how a person holds herself, but i also cringe if the person doesnt have "nice" shoes, there was a time where people would use those hiking boots for casual, or those ugly formal shoes...nope, plain sneakers are cheap and look the best. This is as a first interaction, second would definitely be their fridge, i cant stand people who leave cooked food for strands of times (plus my mom takes the nasty food out of the sink and plates and keeps it in a bag on the fridge), what type of food people have there and drinks.	There was an MTV show kind of like this called Room Raiders! Someone toured three bedrooms and then based on what they found, they picked which of the three contestants they wanted to go on a date with.
What’s the dumbest mistake you made while playing Pokémon?	Accidentally dropped my gameboy causing the game to reset back to new. I had a mew on my old save. No way of getting that back.	When I was playing Red for the first time (I was about 7), I learned the hard way that if you release a Pokémon, it is gone forever. Eezword J the Drowzee... Gone but never forgotten.... 😢
Have any of you guys ever went "hermit mode" and stopped being social? If so, why and how?	Deleting social media. Keeping Facebook and Twitter. See a small group of friends semi-regularly - dinner, drinks etc. Live with flatmates, girlfriend and dog. Speak to some friends on Discord while playing games. Use Whatsapp for everything else. It's a nice balance of being lovely and quiet, without being lonely. I'd consider myself a bit of a hermit.	Deleting social media is a good idea, but actually going hermit mode and not interacting with people is terrible for happiness. Find a small group of people you click with and (mostly) ignore the rest. I basically isolated myself in my room for the past year, and it was fairly destructive. I wouldn't recommend doing that.
How much did getting a girlfriend/boyfriend affect your happiness levels?	You shouldn't look on that like that. That's not what love is about. Try focusing on real male and real female friends But getting a guy fuckbuddies who dominate me (after I accepted I am into male submission) cured my depression	Before: 2-3/7 After: 6/7 I don't like that it's like that, but it's undeniable how much an effect having someone there for you has - someone to talk to on a daily basis, someone that cares about how you're feeling, or what you're up to. There's just a time investment that people make in a relationship that outside of a relationship most people don't want to make.
What is your worst bathroom experience ever?	I skipped to the TLDR and saw wasp and was scared you pooped out a wasp. Idk why that's where my mind went but I'm glad it wasn't that bad for ya.	Coachella 2013. Sat in a rancid, humid porto john full of 3 day old hot stew. I was constipated as fuck and my friends were yelling at me to hurry up because the set we wanted to see was starting soon. So I pushed as hard as I could and I managed to pass a giant dump, but I also gave myself a bloody nose which was too much to handle between the smell and the heat, so I started vomiting.
Married Men, what clever ways did you find to find out your wife's ring size?	She should be dropping some major hints. Things like pointing out rings she thinks looks good. Or making a habit of leaving one of her other rings lying around when she's gone. Leaving web pages open for rings. If all of that fails, ask her friends. If she's not talked about rings and such with her friends she's not ready.	When I started ring shopping for her engagement ring, I took a bar of soap and made an imprint of the ring she wore on her right ring finger. I took the bar of soap to the jeweler and told them it was the right ring finger, so let's go a very little bit larger. Worked perfectly.
What are some "weird" things you and your SO do when you're alone together?	We are not into anal. However, if either of us are ever above the other on a staircase, our finger goes in their butthole. We scream and have an awkward dance on the stairs trying to avoid getting poked while also trying to poke the other person. We also decided that our dog thinks everywhere is the dog park. His grandpas house? The dog park where we sit in the car for 10 hours but she gets a lot of treats from the old man. The vet? The dog park with the ladies who stick things up her butt. The actual dog park? The dog park she does not like because there are too many other dogs.	Make noises at each other. Like, it might start as an actual conversation and just devolve into going "meeerrrrhhhh" back and forth. Example: "Hey, what you doin?" "Meh" "Meh?" "Meeeehhhh" "Muuuugggghhhh" "Bleh" "Bleeeeeggghhhh" And so on until we get tired of it.
How do you live a more interesting life when single/without relying on other people too much?	Try your hand at programming. Doesn't cost much. It's you and your computer. It's you and your ideas. You'll learn a lot about yourself by 'talking' to computer what you want to convey. Compilers are very harsh and unforgiving when you don't give them with precise clarity that they want. You'll learn to express ideas with lot more precision by interacting with your compiler. Think of your programming language compiler/interpreter as your master trying to train you.	"If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias in his garden. He will not be searching for happiness as if it were a collar button that has rolled under the radiator." -W Beran Wolfe
What famous unsolved mystery do you find the most fascinating?	OJ Simpson I don't believe we will ever know what truly happened because of kangaroo courts and the like, and I personally believe he was innocent but the whole thing along with the reaction it elicited just really interests me.	It's a cliche answer, it is probably the most common answer but Jack the Ripper. Being British the "story" is something you hear so much growing up, we have practically made the shadow of the Ripper a national tourist attraction but even with all that press and all that attention nothing has ever been uncovered that solved it. Besides I find serial killers and the psychology behind them generally interesting. Other than that, the Mary Celeste too!
Hypothetical question: If a woman rapes a man and becomes pregnant with his child, do you think the man should be able to terminate the woman's parental rights?	I'd be in favor of that. She'd be too shitty a person to be a good parent anyway. And if she got jail time Id maybe even be okay with a forced abortion if the father wanted it, though that miiight be pushing it. I can't decide.	Yes, for sure. If there is a child of rape, the child should never be forced to live with or be raised by the rapist.
Women of Reddit, what's the dumbest thing you've done out of jealousy?	Omg so much. I made out with my friend's boyfriend in high school. Understandably she wasn't my friend after that. I then posted a picture of us on 4chan asking if anyone had any nudes because that seemed like a logical step?	Not romantic jealousy, but I think it still counts... Every year my husband goes on a father-son adventure with his dad. Two years ago they went to the Bahamas. Now, I was a little envious about that, but I didn't lose my shit until I found out he was going to [Pig Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Beach) without me. The day they went to Pig Beach, I cried and ate an entire pint of ice cream. I had never done that before, and thought it was just something women did in movies, but I felt the jealousy so deeply in my bones that only crying and ice cream seemed to quell the fires of my soul.
What's your worst consensual sex experience?	Had one woman pause halfway through sex to go to the bathroom, ended up ruining the second half. That was the last time I saw her. Had another one that made absolutely no sounds. It was literally just me breathing heavily and the creaking of the bed. That was the only time I had to fake orgasming just so the sex could end.	Hooked up with a coworker and he only liked the most vanilla sex imaginable. He hated if I wanted a faster pace, didn't want me to touch or kiss him at all once he was inside. He just wanted to put his penis inside me and let it marinate until he came.
What is your weirdest dealbreaker?	If he doesn't like tofu. I'm pescatarian and I use tofu when preparing dishes that call for meat from land animals.	If you tell me you're good at Tekken and then pick Eddie when it comes down to proving it I will straight up turn my back on you. After I annihilate you.
Men, what are your deal breakers?	Mine are: * Feminist/SJW/Racist/General Asshole * Majored in Gender Studies (most likely a useless asshole) * Triggered Easy (most likely a weak asshole) * Too far to either side of the US political Spectrum * STDs * Previously having a penis * Shitty Taste in Music/Movies/Media * 420 Friendly preferred, but not required. * Alcohol Friendly preferred, but not required.	During a beautiful, scenic drive through the mountains on a cool fall day, a girl I was dating decided to throw her bag of McDonalds trash out the window.
If you were to provide a single piece of advice to young men growing up today what would you say?	Don't use Tinder and look for women who have brightly coloured hair and or nose piercings. They are the most open minded and cool women you'll ever meet.	At present your physical fitness largely takes care of itself. This will not always be the case. Take up a sport you enjoy - one that you can keep playing into your 40's and 50's. Could be just weightlifting, or running or something like that - and keep at it forever. Particularly watch it around the end of your 20's. Your body will start to change and your lifestyle will probably become more sedentary - thus your calorie intake requirements will change. Watch it like a hawk - its very hard to wind back the clock, but ***your health is your wealth.*** &#x200B; Also, read novels and classic literature.
How significant is a males scent to you? What's the deal with the "musky" smell?	I don't have the study on hand, but a male's scent has a lot to do with attraction. The example in the report given was that women who are in the dating scene are normally on some type of birth control so that messes with their hormones. They end up finding a guy, getting married, and then decide to have a baby so she goes off the birthcontrol. All of a sudden this guy who she has spent a long time with is just gross smelling to her. Neither one of them changed, it is just her hormones are back to normal and his scent isn't doing a lot for her.	First of all, that girl is into you. Second, to answer your question a man's smell is pretty important although I don't think about it at all until I smell it. Like when my husband comes in from mowing the grass or working outside and he's all sweaty and earthy and grassy smelling - instant turn on. A man with too much cologne or many smells that don't harmonize - body spray, deodorant, dry cleaner smell on a suit - ugh. Again, that's something that isn't important until it happens
STEM Women, what challenges have you faced due to your gender? Do you feel that your skill is challenged due to it?	Nothing to offer, other than sending only the best thoughts your way, and as a fellow STEM PhD, though male, assure you that I will judge you on the quality of your output, not the person who writes it.	I'm majoring in Computer Science. Sometimes I feel like I have to work twice as hard for half of the credit, if that makes sense. I also find it challenging (as someone with fairly severe anxiety and a fear of being judged) to ask questions or seek help when I'm having trouble. I'm afraid I won't be a 'person looking for help', but a 'dumb girl in the wrong field'. Though I've made lots of friends (all male... who would have guessed?) which have really proven the contrary. While I may be the only girl or one of the only few in most of my classes, having some people who view me as a person rather than a minority gender really helps calm me.
Why does my boyfriend have such a hard time giving me compliments, but so easily give me criticism?	Because somtimes criticism needs to be said, compliments however don't strictly need to be said at all. Thats how a callous, unfeeling asshole would view it. You're going out with one.	I just got back from my office christmas party, so I'm inebriated. Why does he have a hard time giving compliments? Because He's a fucking asshole. Dump this asshole. I'm drunk.

If you didn't have to worry about startup funds, what type of business would you start?	I would open up a exclusively LGBTQ+ daytime café! We have a lot of night clubs/bars, but I don't think I've ever heard of daytime no age limit café's.	One of two things: 1. A restaurant! Just because I like to cook. I think I would mainly focus on carby, greasy, comfort foods like mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. There would be potatoes in like every form imaginable on the menu. There would be cheese in every form imaginable on the menu. There would be cheesy mashed potatoes. 2. A clothing store that lists the sizes of the clothes in REAL MEASUREMENTS. Centimeters. And the pants will have three numbers, not just one. Diameter of the opening at the waist, diameter of the widest part at the hips, and inseam length. In centimeters. **AND EVERYTHING WILL HAVE POCKETS.**
A woman I had a crush on in high school recently got married and just asked me out for a beer. What's your "The gods are cruel" moment?	The gods aren't cruel, they were looking out for you! The poor man she married is being cheated on. It's a good thing that you didn't marry her. You dodged a bullet.	I've become romantically close to two women in my life, and both times, they decided they liked one of my friends a little better than they liked me
What’s your holy grail when it comes to treating acne scarring/dark spots/dull skin?	Loads of fruits, veggies, and water. Stay away from fried foods and touching your face. Wash your face regularly, but don’t dry it out.	aha (alpha hydroxy acid) serum. there are lots of different options, the one i use is pretty expensive (drunk elephant tlc framboos) but i haven't found one that works nearly as well on my skin
How do you start a conversation with a girl at a bar?	I don't because why would I? She's just going to find me repulsive and I'd only waste her time. I'm there to drink, not bother people who have no interest.	I usually walk up and ask if one of them ( specifically the one I'm interested in) if she wants to jump in and be my pool partner because mine just bailed or something. I find that usually about 75-80% of the time they'll play, then playfully joke around a bit about how bad were gonna win/lose whatever Keeps pressure off, keeps the conversations light and gives you a bit of a chance to get to know her and start flirting. Win or lose you can usually get a drink with them after, or two...
What's it like being pregnant?	I'm 7 weeks pregnant and so so so fucking miserable. It feels a lot like having the flu or food poisoning with no chance of letting up for at least a month. I feel so sick and completely exhausted no matter how much I sleep. Even though the pregnancy was planned and wanted, emotionally, I'm a wreck. I wanted 3-4 children but I am not sure I can do this again in the future.	I found it quite surreal that PEOPLE ARE LIVING INSIDE YOU. They move, strech, kick and have hickups. They like or dislike your music (you're able to feel the difference), so they've even got their own taste. And the moment they get out is even more surreal, but after that they stop feeling like an alien and start just being a baby.
What's the most cringe-inducing thing a guy you've just met has said to you?	This is my mom's story. My parents are divorced and she's gone on a few dates with guys that she met using online dating services. Story 1: My mom meets a man for the first time and really likes him. He's nice, funny, good looking, and he even insists on paying for the meal. The date is going perfectly right up until the end when the topic of gay marriage comes up. Note, my mom's sister is a lesbian and we live in an area where it's uncommon for people to oppose gay marriage. Completely deadpan the man said, "oh of course being gay isn't a choice, after all it is a genetic mutation."	Didn't happen to me, but a co-worker had a guy try to chat her up by complimenting the music we were playing in the café. And then tried to impress her with his music knowledge by telling her that the David Bowie song currently playing (The Man Who Sold The World) was 'actually originally by Nirvana'. And then argued the point.
HR of reddit: What are some common interview mistakes you see? What are some signs that an interview is going well/not well?	When the manager sits in the interview and was late to sit in with the supervisor interviewing you...then proceeds the whole time texting on her phone following the interview being interrupted by her cell phone. The ringer continued to go off and the interview was quickly derailed after this interupption. As the interviewee I found this extremely rude.	It seems so obvious, but show up on time. Give yourself way more time than you think you'd need. It's better to just sit in a coffee shop for 20 minutes than to show up late.
Have you ever had your hair cut against your will?	>As a guy I cannot really relate much, so how traumatic would this be if it happened to you? I haven't had this happen. However, saying you can't relate is just a failure to empathize masked as a gendered thing. It's not about hair. I mean it's a little about hair. But mainly it's about autonomy and being told what you can and can't do with your body and how you express yourself.	As a 14 year old girl, it would have been devastating. I know a guy whose mother would purposely overfeed him and his brother so they'd be "too fat to love"(Her actual words) and wouldn't leave her. With that kind of abuse it's not really about the act itself. It's the message that the act conveys which is "You do not control your body. I control your body."
What are some quotes or proverbs that people keep repeating thinking they sound clever or deep, but you just think they're stupid?	"If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best!" -Marilyn Monroe, the unhappy, lonely drug addict who killed herself.	Anything that is anchor themed that says "I refuse to sink". I get so irrationally irritated when I see this. Anchors fucking sink. That's just what they do. You anchor themed pillow makes no sense. -___-
Women who have worked in retail or restaurants, what's the worst customer you have ever experienced?	People have always been nasty, but the only ones who stood out are the older ladies who would rather wait longer in line than be checked out by me, who was wearing a hijab at the time. It was obvious.	I worked at wendys for a year. One night around 9 a couple came in and got a ton of stuff, asking for it all made fresh. The girl got 20 nuggets with cheese sauce and called herself a pig. They went to a table and ate, no problems. After they left I went to clean the table and there was cheese sauce and chili spread all over the table. Half eaten chicken nuggets everywhere. Napkins thrown everywhere, including the floor. With that many Napkins, they could have cleaned up their mess. The girl was right. She is a pig.
How would the world be different if men could get pregnant too?	Men *can* get pregnant. Now, if people with penises could get pregnant, you'd see most of what other folks have been saying.	ABORTIONS FOR ALL. Abortion clinics everywhere. There will be no stigma. Using contraceptives will no longer be controversial. Funding will come in like a water fountain. There will be a crap ton more options for men. Childcare costs will probably skyrocket. At the very least, employers will probably have to pay for at least some of it. Mandatory paid parental leave?
Hi, AW! What small changes did you make to your everyday routine that vastly improved the quality of your life?	Spend 10-15 minutes picking up your house after work, that way it doesn't build up until your day off. :)	I started getting up early enough to actually feel ready to leave the house. I was always like "yeah, I can be out the door in 15 minutes." Then I realized that while I could be out the door in 15 minutes, I wasn't actually getting ready before I left. I was still getting ready for the day at my desk, which was wrecking my drive in and eating time out of my day. I had an honest check to see how long it actually took me to really get ready with breakfast, dishes, etc. on my ideal morning, and I went from there. It was rough at first, but so much nicer to be functional at work - and people notice it.
How often do you just relax and lounge around? Do you struggle with relaxation guilt? If so, how do you unlearn the 24/7 hustle?	I do. Like right now. And yes, I have intense relaxation guilt. I'm still sold on the 24/7 hustle. I really would rather end up semi-wealthy and be in at least the lower upper class if not higher. And I do good. I can rock an honest 100+ hr work with we ease, but... yeah, this is me right now, struggling to relax, knowing or feeling I should be striving in this moment, but not too.... >.< You spying on me through my webcam in this moment o.O ?????	Pretty much any time I am not at work or have social obligations. I am lazy as hell. My life pretty much centers around finding the balance between the maximum amount of comfort for the least amount of effort. I have my 9-5 job that pays my bills and gives me enough to have fun. I have no interest in the stress of working constantly. It's a big reason I am childfree. I need my downtime to stay sane and balanced. I cannot imagine being happy with every minute scheduled and accounted for. I am happiest when left to my own devices. I feel zero guilt for relaxing.
Have you ever had issues with someone who had high emotional intelligence and could "read" you too well? Those on the other side, do you ever feel like you're being manipulative because of your gift?	I have actually caught myself pulling string and molding their will. It feels great. I feel like a super villain had sex with Sherlock Holmes and I'm that baby	I once dated a guy who had an incredible ability to relate to people. Charisma through the roof. He made me feel fantastic about myself, but I always maintained the slightest shadow of doubt about his sincerity. He told people what they wanted to hear. He was also a terrifyingly convincing bullshitter. Overall he was a good person, though. I'm just not sure I could have really trusted him in the long term.
Men of reddit, what would be the best way for a girlfriend to express her concerns about the weight her boyfriend has gained? Is there a way to do this without crushing his self esteem?	You've gotten really terrible advice in this thread. He knows he's gained weight. He knows it isn't healthy. He doesn't want to be preached at, belittled, or bribed with sex. Lead by example... make him part of the process "I heard about this place __________ where there's a beautiful hike to a waterfall (or whatever). I thought we could go for a hike together on Saturday-- want to go?". Keep him active-- then, as you see he's losing weight, tell him how hot he looks, etc.	My girlfriend just straight up told me she thinks I've been gaining weight and what can we do about it. It hurt a bit but I'm no fool I noticed I was gaining weight. I appreciated her honesty
Women who are fit, how often do you work out?	What do you mean by 'fit'? I look really fit. I have really good muscle definition (obliques, sometimes other ab definition as well, crazy calves and very toned arms) but I'm not in peak physical condition at the moment because I haven't worked out properly in over 6 months. I'm a 'naturally fit' kind of person, so I can probably still run a pretty good time on 10km and lift a fair bit for my size, even tho I feel out of shape for me. I used to dance and I think it set me up pretty well. I still walk everywhere (maybe like 5km a day?), but beyond that it's pretty much no exercise for me. Don't really diet either, but I'm not prone to overeating.	I exercise in some capacity 7 days a week. I do yoga at least 5 days a week, sometimes more. It varies from a slow flow to vinyasa. I do kickboxing once a week and go for a run 2-3 times a week.
Enough relationship/dating posts! Would you rather be a Jedi master, Pokemon trainer or Harry Potter witch/wizard?	Harry Potter wizards are so lame, though. Don't get me wrong, I love the HP books and the story is aight, but I just think that all those bloody powers and things that would actually be helpful are restricted by some rather retarded rules. I'd go with Sith Lord and be happy as fuck. Fuck those jedi dweebs.	I would be a Jedi (in this world). *you will enter me into the payroll system and forget about me* If I'm lowkey about the mind tricks I could be the best investigate journalist/politician/cop/husband ever. Where does she want to go do dinner? "You want to go to Qdoba" *I want to go to Qdoba* ***** "What's wrong" *nothing* "What's wrong" *waves* *Becky got promoted at work and she's a size 7*
What is something girls do that they don’t realize hurts your feelings?	When they say hey I don't like you like you like me let's be friends. Bitch nahhhh that sounds like the worst friendship ever I'd rather be friends with Hitler	When our daughter was still an infant, my wife would sometimes take the baby away from me to comfort her when she was crying. It made me feel like a shitty father. Why wasn't I good enough to comfort our child? It's was an instinctual reaction of course. My wife meant nothing by it. But I had to make her realize what she was doing and how it made me feel.
Non-American women of AW, what are the "marketed beauty standards" in your area of the world?	Is this describing a 'beauty standard' or a media stereotype? My sense is that without mass media, all these countries would have a 'beauty standard' that was far closer to local ethnicity. Apart from all that, I think the white skin / blonde hair etc isn't based on stereotyped physical attractiveness - it's a shorthand for what the wealthiest human females look like, or those sought by the wealthiest males look like. If dark skin was the dominant skin type for the wealthiest on the planet, I'm pretty sure all those other countries would be darkening their skin.	Australia. You want to be thin and toned, with a deep natural looking tan and tousled (i.e lightly curled) hair that appears to have been lightened from the sun (but of course, is from the hair salon). Makeup is important and many of us are into the whole contour thing but there's a real emphasis on looking 'naturally' perfect rather than made up.
Who is the "village idiot" at your workplace, and why?	For once in my life, I am at a job where everyone from the Executive Director down to myself (the lowly office administrator), is treated with the same respect. We are an office of all women, with the one token dude, and it is a respectful, caring, fun, environment. We lift each other up, and try and support each other as best as we can. We have high stress work, so being able to vent to eachother, and to say "what the f@#$!" (My ED's favorite phrase she taught us), without fear of retribution, or judgement is wonderful. Every single day my job does not feel like work. I am truly blessed! *edit for spelling	I work with someone who is completely helpless with technology. They have, on multiple occasions, forgotten how to copy/paste text on the computer. They've had to be taught multiple times where the minimize button is on a program. They've mistaken Internet Explorer for Windows Explorer for two years, and they've assumed that by turning their monitor off that they're rebooting their computer. My company is developing an instrument & software for the medical field. We use this person to "idiot-proof" every single thing - software updates, new lab procedures, documents, etc. There are dozens of changes and upgrades we've made simply because this person found new ways to be incompetent. In some ways, I suppose that makes the village idiot useful.
What is something you want in a relationship that is politically incorrect to say that you want?	Holy shit this thread is awful. It's just Reddit circlejerking against political correctness and getting mad about things not being politically correct when in reality no one gives a shit.	I just want to date someone who is mentally healthy. Almost every girl I've dated has complained constantly about her crippling anxiety/body dysmorphia/depression, etc. I understand that everyone has their own demons to wrestle and I feel bad for saying it. I really would enjoy the company of someone who is stable and consistent though.
The year is over! What small change or simple habit did you discover in 2017 that was life-changing?	I gave up carbs. I started it as a weight loss effort,and it worked (lost 56 pounds) but it ended as more than that. My migraines have almost stopped, I went from at least 1 a week to 1 in the past six months. My skin is much better and my energy level is so high I work out 4-5 times a week! It has downfalls of course like it can be more challenging to eat out, or hard to go to events like weddings without a good amount of planning. But it is so worth it! Also got a squatty potty. I strongly suggest it to everyone.	I started to bring my lunch to work due to the need of saving money. At the end of the year, I lost about 40lbs so Im pretty grateful for that.
Men who live with your SO's: What things do you wish in hindsight you'd talked about with your SO before moving in together?	I've been living with me SO for coming up on 3 decades now. We don't talk much but she's definitely my right hand woman. You could say we are attached for life barring any unforeseen accidents.	My wife and I have entirely different definitions of personal space and personal time. When we moved in together, it was a disaster. I walk in through the door after work and I'm slammed with 21 questions about my day and her day and everything else in between, which is something I was not used to. When I get home I like to unwind and relax for a few minutes before anything else. My wife likes to unwind by unloading her day on me. I've also just realized that I'm introverted, and she is not, so when I crave quiet and space, she craves conversation and closeness. It has taken nearly a year for us to adapt to each other and even know we still have hiccups, but we'll get through it.
Men who changed their diet from complete garbage food to very healthy food, how did you deal with being such an intolerable cunt for the first week or so?	Part of being a man is knowing how to control the feeling of being a cunt. It doesn't matter if you've invited a new variable into your life, it's not anyone else's fault. I've been through the crap food detox phase while I watched my friends pig out on delicious food, but it was my choice to do that so I don't hold it against them for eating what they want to. You'll have head aches and you have strong cravings for carbs and everything, but keep your eye on your goal. Know that when everyone says the crap week ends and you start feeling better is telling the truth. You just have to push through it and want it enough, it becomes easier over time but you have to find that out on your own.	You get over it in about a week. Drink plenty of water, especially after a meal, sleep right and just wait it out. It's tough. It can last for a couple if days to a week or so. You'll be fine.
I have 4 positive pregnancy tests with a paragaurd in. In what situations have you been in complete denial?	This happens more often than you think. There have been babies born with the device in their bodies. So definitely get this looked into asap..	Please don't stay in denial with this. Pregnancy with an iud has an increased risk of being ectopic. You need to see a doctor asap.
Ladies of reddit, what do you think of facials?	UGH. Im bummed that the NSFW interpretation of "facial" was the first thing I thought of when I saw your question. Cause the NSFW facials are so depressing and awful. Don't like em. Don't know any woman that would like them. Degrading. Doesn't seem fun. But getting to YOUR question: I'd love a facial! I just had my first pedicure the other week and it was so wonderful. I'm sold and look forward to getting a facial soon too - I'm sure they're fantastic:)	I'm scared to do facials because my skin can be reactive. I'd hate to pay so much for rashes or breakouts. I like hand and scalp massages. Anywhere else massages put me on edge. I don't like people touching me. I do like heat and I am tempted to see if the hot stone massage could bypass my touching issues.
What is a male stereotype you think is true for most men?	Most of the stereotypes have a basis in reality, and obviously there are going to be exceptions. So I'd say pretty much all of them?	Stalling medical issues. Pretty much every guy I know needs to be on death's door before they'll see a doctor, myself included, and we have socialised healthcare.
Anyone got a breast lift? Was it worth it?	If you want breast lift *with* implants, I take it as your breasts are not too large. If you have average-sized or slightly big breasts and they're on the saggy side, you can actually lift them up with some exercises. While I haven't seen an example myself, a personal trainer had said you can ever make your breasts appear one cup size bigger by gaining some muscles on the chest area.	I personally do not, but have a close friend who has. Her situation was similar to your own. Young, no kids, yet already deflated breasts. She got a lift with implants and absolutely loved them. No sensation loss in nipples. She said she would definitely do it again. Best of luck!
Today an older lady approached me to say that I smelled 'lovely' and asked what perfume I was wearing. Has this happened to you? What were you wearing? Have you asked the question yourself?	I'm a happily married man and I often want to tell women that they smell good, but I have yet to figure out way to do it without sounding creepy. It's not a sexual thing or me trying to proposition them or anything. I just think someone should let them know that they smell nice. (I even just creeped myself out a little typing that...)	Sort of. I was hugging my best friend in high school when he suddenly said "You smell really good" and hugged me again and actually *inhaled deeply*. It was just shampoo.
It's peak tomato season right now. How are you enjoying the tomatoes? What have you been making?	can't tell if this is some innuendo/code I'm not getting or if this is genuinely just about peak tomato season	I made some soup. I thought it was incredible but after a while I realized I might have just made pizza sauce.
Men who complain about being single are told to work on self-improvement. Women don't seem to get this advice so often. Why do you think this is?	We get this too, you know. Like someone else said, when a woman gets turned down, she thinks "What's wrong with me?", whereas a guy gets turned down and says "What's wrong with her?" We're taught all our lives that men want nothing but sex all the time. So if he doesn't find you sexually attractive, he's either gay or there's something wrong with you.	Just throwing this against the wall to see if it sticks. If I call my dad and say, "I had a crap day because my boss is being unfair," my dad will try to suggest ways that I can solve this problem. If I call my mother and say the same thing, she will empathize with me and talk to me about how I can resolve those feelings. I wonder if this difference is coming, in part, from where we are getting our advice. If men turn to other men more often, they might get more of the solutions oriented advice. If women turn to other women, then might get more empathy and "You don't need a relationship to be happy" kind of talk.
Depression sufferers, how does your depression usually manifest?	I tend to get tired, mentally. You know what it's like to have a long, draining day, where you just get so tired and can't wait to go to bed, so you can stop dealing with the world? It's like that, only more or less constant. When I was at my worst a few years back, I slept about 18 hours/day. There's also bouts of numbness (no feelings of happy/sad/anger/anything), and bouts of extreme vulnerability (to whatever, be it tones of voice from others or sad movies.)	I tend to get tired, mentally. You know what it's like to have a long, draining day, where you just get so tired and can't wait to go to bed, so you can stop dealing with the world?

What is your 'oh fuck i am an idiot' moment?	My boyfriends dad bought me a used phone but when he gave it to me we realized there was a crack in the camera lense causing the picture to be foggy, so we had to replace it. We came back a week later and he had all the tools to replace it. When I put the new piece on and tried to take a picture it was still foggy and couldn't figure out why. I realized after 10 minutes that I had put it on wrong and as soon as I fixed it, it worked perfect. I tried to play it off but they both laughed at me. :(	Yesterday I put my external hard drive in my backpack, then immediately got up from my backpack and started searching my house, looking for that same external hard drive so I could put it in that same backpack, all the while thinking to myself "I could swear I just saw it but I don't remember where." I put it exactly where I wanted it, then immediately forgot. It took me an hour to realize it was already put away, after I'd already given up on it and returned to my backpack for something else.
Is there a stigma surrounding women doing "men stuff" similar to the one around men doing "feminine stuff"?	If you're a cute girl? Definitely not. A pretty lady who is into wood working, metal smithing, weight lifting, home/car repair, computer building, gaming, sports, or any other stereotypical "male" activity will usually get a lot of attention from guys and women will often have a "girl crush". If you're not hot? It really depends on your attitude as to whether people will view this as a positive or negative thing.	a lot of women are told they're just doing it to get attention from men. like the whole "fake geek girl" thing, where men think their dumb favorite tv show or game is so unique that no woman could possibly be interested in it, so they have to quiz you on really dumb facts nobody cares about.
Overweight men of /AskMen , why haven't you started the process of losing weight? What will push you to do so?	I have, it's difficult, my family is not healthy at all. Very difficult to change things so drastically when everyone surrounding you has very bad habits. It's not as easy as it looks, it really isn't. Stop chalking up everything to "laziness" or people finding excuses (although these people do exist, most people would love to just stay at a healthy weight).	If I had the answer I would no longer be overweight. Or I would at least be working on it. I am not sure what will motivate me to do it, but I do know I should.
What do other women do that embarrasses you as a woman?	Well it doesn't *embarrass* me, but as far as "setting us back," I do believe that 92% of married women in 2013 in the U.S. choosing to take their husband's names perpetuates the idea of women being every so slightly less important than men in society.	Whenever girls share those "when I say go away is the moment I need you to stay the most" or the more tongue in cheek "women's dictionary" posts or anything like it. I don't think they realize it just makes women seem crazy and unable to convey their thoughts as they are. Please stop trying to make women look complex in a crazy kind of way. It just comes back to bite us in the ass. As a girl who IS very straight forward and have people always bugging me because obviously I mean to say the opposite of what I'm saying, this is VERY annoying.
What are some things you would tell the 14 year old version of yourself?	You have all the power to you in the world. Focus even further on robotics, do FRC earlier. Be more of a leader in robotics, go get the Gavels you deserved in MUN. Don't worry about the girls that laughed at you and teased you and were mean to you because they didn't like you. Commit yourself to mathematics and CS. No reason you shouldn't have gotten a 7 on the Math HL exam. Or the CS HL Exam. Or the Chem HL exam. You want to go to MIT. Stay Salty, and stay hungry. Yes HS was easy, but you can't stay complacent.	JFC stop eating so goddamn much. You're better than this. It'll save you a lot of bullying and heartache later. You're objectively attractive and you've spent your childhood thinking you're destined to be the ugly fat friend who will never find love. Don't date anyone until you meet your future husband, or at least don't date these specific people. Work harder in school and at least go to community college, dad offered to pay for it but you were so busy goofing off that you never went. It's okay to question religion. It's okay to question sexuality. Also, here are the sports results for the next 13 years. You know what to do.
How much sex would be too much for you?	Not sure as I haven't found a partner with a higher libido. But mine have been on the decline so I doubt I can go back to at least 3x a day back in college. So let's say 3 - 4x a day.	> How much would be too much for you personally? Really couldn't know until we reached the point where the spirit was willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised. I know that I've never come close to my limit in the long term, only ever on specific days where we had especially long marathon sex.
What sub-reddits are you guys subscribing to that aren't the obvious ones?	Oh baby, where can I start. /r/games A lightyear beyond the quality of /r/gaming. /r/askwomen A great laugh. What terrible advice, all the time. /r/Floridaman The worst superhero. /r/fatpeoplestories Just go read. /r/pcmasterrace Despite the circlejerk, occasionally a good resource for sales and deals on parts. In conjunction with /r/buildapc There are so, so many more. /r/justneckbeardthings. /r/enlightenedbirdmen. /r/gaming4gamers. If you're so inclined, /r/theredpill. On that last one: 80% crap, 20% amazing self improvement advice. Edit: my god, how could I forget: /r/dadjokes /r/fiftyfifty /r/beer	/r/askhistorians . Note that the moderation is extremely strict, posting joke answers on more than one occasion tends to be met with a ban. This policy is extremely popular on the sub, and it has made the sub a great place to actually learn. I'd recommend just reading unless you have experience in formal history academia. /r/NFL Quality's declining a bit as the sub grows, but still a great place for NFL news and discussion. Tone of the community is both welcoming and full of trash-talking. /r/FrugalJerk /r/Scotch /r/Games Higher quality, more on topic take on /r/gaming. Quality is slowly starting to decline a bit. /r/PCMasterRace /r/UpliftingNews
How long would you wait for a date to show up?	I'm waiting five minutes before leaving, I value my time and don't like time wasters. If she is going to run a few minutes late I'm expecting a text on her end. Women who respect you will send a text if they're running a few minutes late. If she straight up flakes I treat it as a no call no show and move on completely. It's not worth being around a woman that doesn't respect your time. Plenty of other women out there who make things easy for you.	I always have first dates at a place where I can hang out at the bar until they show up and where I like the food. If they don't show in the first hour, I'll go ahead and order food, enjoy my meal and then roll out whenever I feel like after.
To the grown-up, fully certified adult women out there: how did you come to terms with all the stereotypical expectations?	By refusing all of them. I refuse to engage in gendered behavior in my relationship or anywhere else. It's been working out well so far. I'm 22 and in a relationship with my partner. We split things 50/50 as far as chores and finances. Don't accept anything less. If you start to compromise and let men treat you like a nanny or a maid, you'll never get out of that pattern. Stand up for yourself and demand equality from the very beginning.	Life is what you make it. Don't want to get married? Ok, don't get married. Don't want to have kids? Don't have kids. Don't want to take on the entire mental load? Don't date a child. There are plenty of households where both spouses share the housework and emotional labor. There are plenty of households with happy spouses that don't have children. There are plenty of happy single people. There are plenty of happy couples that never get married. I'm not gonna lie and tell you that you won't get pushback from people who think you should live the way they want you to, but just stand your ground and make your life into what you want it to be. Yolo. Curate your life to bring you happiness.
How do you handle other women who are aggressive and condescending in the workplace?	Change your perspective. Watch how she communicates and take notes of her work ethic. Not only will you learn from it but sooner or later you will carry that trait also. If you don’t care to move forward at your work place then just think of it as a pay check and nothing more. You just wanna make money and go about your day.	I try to avoid this situation, shrug it off. When I don't like someone at work I only deal with them as much as my professional capacity demands, and only professionally. I try to transfer away from that person as soon as I possibly can.
Ladies of reddit, what were your teenage insecurities?	Hmm well....it's complicated. So I'm trans so my insecurities were...a ton. * Truly hated myself and who I was as a person and thought I had no friends because I truly sucked at life. * Joined theater to have friends and because if I couldnt be cool, I could at least pretend to be a cool person in a script * Joined sports so I wouldnt be such a bookwordy nerd and because I wanted to be stronger. I was ashamed of having such a short and small frame. (which was a blessing when I started transitioning) * And I was also hiding all of my gender related issues. I didnt want everyone to think I was homo. (And now here I am, pansexual trans woman. Surprise!)	Acne. I swore to God I'd never let my kids go through what I did, and they both inherited my skin. I tried so hard to help them, but it was a losing battle. My mother always said, if you have oily skin, you don't end up with wrinkles. But you do get acne past middle age; not as bad, but yeah.
What's the female equivalent to "steak and a blow job"?	while reading the comments I realized.. there IS NO equivalent to "steak and a BJ" for women..every woman want's something else, men are simple creatures to satisfy, you give them a nice meal and a BJ and they're happy, but not for women... and I'll take a wild guess, even If a women had an equivalent for one situation, I'm pretty sure it changes when in another.	I still want a double dosing of red meat, so steak (medium rare) and a dicking would be delightful. Alas, I can't come up with any catchy alliteration to go along with it.
Women working in male dominated fields, what is the worst thing a male coworker has said to you?	Worst? That's a tall order - I've had almost exclusively positive experiences in my professional life. If I had to choose, it'd be "hurry the fuck up, we don't have all day" as I was churning out something for a deadline. Not even bad at all, he says things like that to all of us, it wasn't directed at me as a woman at all	I worked in construction for a couple months. The worst was my coworker telling me about all the prostitute sites he's been on and seeing if I'd be interested in something with him. The worst part was once I put in my resignation my manager declined the validity of my statement and that even women ogle guys like Brad Pit. And that he was sure all the guys considered me like a daughter. Then he gave me an awkward hug. I was so pissed. The owner gave me my two weeks off, paid.
Women of reddit who hover over public toilets: why don't you lift the seat?	If I was gonna take the time to do that I might as well just take the time to put the stupid little paper thing on the seat. I just want to get in and out with touching as few things as possible. And for the last time, no, I don't get piss all over the seat. Don't fucking tell me "Yes you do, you just don't realize it!" because that's stupid. You are not there in the stall refereeing my piss. I have eyes. I can see the seat when I'm done. There is nothing there. I get more pee on my own toilet seat at home from sitting down on it (the pee drips off when I stand/lean up to wipe).	It's so irritating that people hover because they think something about the toilet seat is gross, but then proceed to pee all over it. YOU ARE THE REASON YOU HOVER
What's an overly specific turn-on of yours?	Politics aside, Vladimir Putin's swag! He is the only man over 60 years old that I damn near drool over.	When a person who normally isn't very smooth or flirtatious winks at you. Especially if it's done after they've said something or made a joke to someone else.
Are men affected by media portrayals of *fit* bodies?	I think that men's "ideal standard" is actually more unrealistic than women's as /u/knuckldragger pointed out in his post. That's definitely true. However, does it *affect* us? I don't think it really does. Men's value in dating is heavily skewed toward their value as a provider, while women's value is heavily skewed towards physical attractiveness. I can only speak for myself, but I don't feel shitty about myself just because I don't look like G.I. Joe, or because there's a more muscular guy nearby. I stay in decent shape and I really feel no pressure to do any more than that, so I can't say I'm really "affected" by the media portrayals of men's bodies.	A little. But I'm more affected by the media's portrayal of men as mindless idiots who are constantly derailed by the slighted hint of sex.
At the hospital with my wife who is about to go into labor. She’s been reading books and talking to other mothers for months to prepare, but I figured y’all could help me knock it out this morning. So dads, what do I expect when I’m expecting?	They’ll say not to do it, but bring some granola bars for her to snack on and she’ll love ya for it. I’m not saying let her eat her fill! Just have them to curb the tide	I have 2 kids, both over 10lbs born naturally. She's going to say some shit to you. Some things that will hurt, some things that you will struggle not to laugh at. When the baby is out, she won't remember much of it and all will be well in your relationship. During the birth of our second one, she told me she was going to save the placenta and cook it up with my balls for a dinner to celebrate our divorce. After she swore she never said it. That was 18 years ago. I still slightly worry about it when she gets pissed.
What do you think about the not standing up during the national anthem controversy?	To me, not standing for the anthem is a fine form of protest and if someone doesn't want to stand I think that should be legal and seen as a protest thing. In the US people are even allowed to burn the US flag in protest if desired, so I don't really comprehend why not standing up during the playing of the anthem isn't seen in a similar light. I think what complicates this issue is that the people who are refusing to stand are athletes, paid to participate in the event. I don't really know what to say there, if their employer wants to suspend them or not pay them for not standing for the anthem while they're "at work", it's a bit different than if they were refusing to stand for the anthem while attending an event they're not paid for.	My mom is a veteran and her thoughts on the matter are as follows: Take a look at everyone else in the crowd during the anthem. There are people talking, laughing, drinking beer, eating their hotdogs, getting up to go to the bathroom before the game starts, sitting with their hats still on. There are plenty of people in the crown not "respecting" the flag or the anthem so why is this guy getting attacked for it? At least he's standing up (or sitting down) for a cause he believes in. Whether you believe in his cause or not, he has a right to do it. She always says she didn't join the military to fight for only the rights that she believed in. She fought for everyone's right to freedom. And this is how he chooses to use his.
Is he a creeper or just lonely?	I don't care for the word creeper, but it's more than lonely. Obviously he's depressed, suicidal, and desperate for connection. I don't know why you jump to getting raped from there, but I'd just put him on limited profile so he can't see your wall, photos etc.	While he may have depression issues, its even more unhealthy for him to live in a fantasy world based off your social media profiles. I think you need to unfriend and block him, otherwise his obsession will continue to grow and continue to influence your life.
Do you guys like to be "romanced"?	I don't want to be "romanced" I want the girl to let me romance her, even if it's not her thing.	I feel like people should actively romance each other, whatever that may be to you. For her to dismiss what you'd like sometimes is kinda crappy.
No more sex?	How about eating her pussy? You mentioned blow jobs in your OP but not reciprocal pleasuring. Maybe you weren't getting her off and she has opted out? Everybody gets tired, everybody gets stressed. It doesn't normally last for two years. Talk to her. Tell her that you feel neglected sexually and you want to either work it out or arrange to see a couples counselor. I'm wondering why you've let this go on for so long.	> a total of 5 times in two years This sounds like a nightmare. You might as well be single. Jesus. I'm feel bad I don't have advice. To be honest I would have *serious* problems if my wife didn't put out in a months time, let alone 5 in 2 years. I would have run already.
My wife told me she's no longer in love with me and is considering divorce, what should I do?	Love is a choice. She hasn't fallen out of love; she has decided that she no longer wants to show love to you. That's pretty crappy of her. I don't subscribe to the idea that we fall in and out of love. Love is an action, not a passive emotion. We don't need to feel love for someone before we show love for someone. Right now she has a choice of whether or not to love you and she's choosing not to. It sucks. Then she's hiding behind the excuse of "not feeling like it". There's a chance there is something deeper going on. I'd encourage you to take what you can out of marriage counselling and use it moving forward in other relationships. You can't make her stay. This is unfortunate and I'm sad to here this. :(	Went through something pretty similar although without children. One day out of nowhere Wife tells me she doesn't love me anymore and hadn't for months. She checked out emotionally and when she only agreed to reluctantly work on it, it only lasted a week. She only did it in the first place to feel less guilty about leaving. Kind of like "Well, I tried!" I feel for you, man. This sucks. It will get worse before it gets better. Don't try to rationalize it as none of it will make sense. She's been thinking about this for months and has already justified her actions and is probably just humoring you. Start planning for a divorce right now and focus on your children. Again, I'm really sorry. Best of luck to you.
What is your most fappable sexual fantasy that you don't plan to do in real life?	Making some hipster (tattoos, skinny fat, large glasses) college chick cheat on her soy-boy-friend with me. Breeding the alt bitch in the process (with my super male vitality seed) and then, totally organically, beta boyfriend steps in and marries to take care of "our" genetically superior kid. After few years I cum back. IRL I would do just consensual cuckolding without breeding, everybody done stuff I listed?	Probably a eightsome with a bunch of hot college girls where they hold me down, then an even hotter, shy kind of gal is sat down on me by the others where the objective is stop me from pulling out. NSFW tag *please*!
Did you have a special stuffed animal as a child?	I had a hippo that I loved a lot and had it for years, but I threw it out of the window on the highway for some reason and it was lost forever. Still mad at myself.	Sure do! A stuffed bear that somehow young me thought was a wolf without a tail and has round ears. Mr. Howler is currently on my side of the bed XD
Have you ever encountered a sociopath? If so, what's your story?	We have one as our president elect. The Trumpanzee is very clearly both, a sociopath as well as a narcissist.	My friend's younger brother was diagnosed as a sociopath in his teens after attempting to kill her several times as a child. I only met him once, and even knowing he was diagnosed and knowing the signs, he seemed fine, charming even. My only memory of him involves singing karaoke together with him at one of their family events. He struggled with various drug addictions as an adult, and died of an overdose last year. It's been very difficult for his family because it's both terrible and a relief to have him gone at the same time, and then of course they feel guilty for being relieved.
[Serious] How many of you men don't care for blow jobs?	That's hot as fuck. Cannot believe there's a man out there that would react like that to you. Move on woman	Blowjobs are fine, but I'm not really excited about them. This'll sound weird, but blowjobs feel a bit... distant. For me, the best sex is a lot about physical closeness, about inhaling her scent, whispering in her ear how I'm going to make her come, crushing her against me, licking and biting her... a lot of that dynamism is lost when she's way down there and there's really nothing I can do except enjoy. It's fun foreplay, but for the main course, I prefer something that'll leave us sweaty and breathless.
When referring to yourself, are you a woman or are you a girl?	I (age 22, 23 tomorrow) identify as genderfluid, but when I feel female, I say girl in front of friends and woman in front of almost everyone else. I guess I do this because I'm afraid of not being taken seriously.	I feel like a girl, but refer to myself as a woman. Because I want to be seen and treated as a capable adult, not an overgrown child. 31 years old.
How would you feel if a girl insists on using condoms that she brought?	I'd be a little confused if there wasn't an explanation, but alergies to latex is a perfectly understandable one. I guess I would only care then if it didn't fit well (I know which brand works well for me). Since I am not a child the idea of you poking holes in the condom wouldn't come up. How would you do it without puncturing the wrapping? It's not like I would use one that was already opened. Gah, sorry, those kinds of guys give the rest of us a bad name.	Unless I see red flags I'd have a hard time imagining the girl wants to get pregnant. What's her plan using me next, will she even find me? If she adds in her allergies issues that will be perfect. Paranoid me could offer something like "it's the dude's responsibility to provide male contraception. Please show me what brands work for you, I'll get a box. Okay, I bought that, does it work?"
What’s the luckiest thing that’s ever happened to you?	You're clearly feeling generous, OP. Why don't you tell us the luckiest thing that's happened to you? Hit the jackpot and decided to make it rain?	I was at a mall and heard a woman scream from the upper level. I turned around, looked up....and reflexively caught a toddler who had somehow managed to squeeze between the iron safety rails and fallen literally on top of me, a good 20-25 feet below. Perfect catch, not a scratch. I've replayed this in my head dozens of time and still to this day do not know how the hell I did this.
Why do women get upset when men watch porn?	Weird cultural myths they have. Misinformation from religious types and radfems. Grossly misunderstanding what the fuck their man is doing in a relationship with them and what the fuck porn is for.	*Asks a bunch of men* Could be a lot of things, they probably think it harms women (it is a pretty messed up industry), they think their SO uses it to replace them, they think it's distasteful, they were brought up to think it was evil, etc.
Ladies with facial hair and sensitive skin, how do you remove your hair without getting pimples everywhere?	Hair conditioner worked for me when I shaved my legs a lot playing volleyball and basketball back in the day. No rash or bumps or ingrown hairs.	I use to just shave daily and suffer the pimples since I have eczema as well. If you can afford it I would absolutely recommend laser hair removal it changed my life.
Women who have dated guys you knew were great for you but you didn't feel that romantically attracted to them, how did dating them turn out for you?	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities as we do not allow posts that limit responses to those from majority demographics. Everyone else, please feel free to respond based on the gender of partners you prefer.	I'm currently in this situation. Dammit, he's a great guy. He's smart and handsome and well travelled and likes all the same things I do...and I've just got nothing, no excitement to see him, no attraction. We've only been seeing each other for about a month and I keep hoping I'll suddenly get butterflies for him. Reading this thread is making me think I should just break it off now. Drat. :(
Men who are frequently complimented, what kind of compliments do you receive?	Not a dude that gets many compliments, but I got a friend who is well educated/groomed and dresses nicely. I've heard him get compliments randomly from women on everything: tie, glasses, shoes, jacket - all on separate occasions. A properly fit wardrobe can do you wonders.	"Dude, you're hilarious, how are you still single?" Same reason I'm on the radio instead of in front of a camera.
Content and happy guys of askmen, how do you do it?	Engage in activities & exercise, give less fucks, and stop wishing for some girl to come along to make you happy cuz she probably ain't coming until you already are happy.	Largely stopped caring about a lot of things that don't directly effect me. Not to say I don't care about anyone or anything, because I do - without caring I wouldn't be able to find happiness in stuff that I do and others accomplish Just have to find peace with who you are, where you are, and take each day as they come.
How do you guys deal with your girlfriend’s guy friends making sexual comments at her?	That your GF is putting herself in situations where such comments are elicited tells you everything you need to know. Chances are that you’re her relationship object and she’s still got a side eye making sure that her options remain open for a better sex object. Women’s hypergamous nature is dichotomous. It has been my experience you’re better off being their sex object than their relationship object. You’re in the wrong camp my man.	Well they don't respect you that's for sure. If they make sexual comments towards your woman and she refuses to shut it down then you shut it down for her. If they joked in front of me about sleeping with her I would joke back about them ending on the back of a milk carton. &#x200B;
How do you feel about your friends (male or female) who can't seem to manage to get dates?	>Does anyone else have friends that are always single (male or female) and can never manage to get dates? Yep >Do they talk/complain to you about it? Yep >Do you try and help set them up or give them (contructive) advice? I'm a socially dysfunctional crazy person who generally feels antagonized by the vast majority of people who show interest in her. >Do you feel guilty talking to them about it if you seem to do ok with finding partners? I feel guilty because I'd like to be more supportive but I'm just sitting there thinking "people are dumb, why do you want to date them?" 1 person who is truly important is better than 100 one night stands. At least that's my opinion, I also know people who hate close relationships and would rather just bang as many people as possible before they croak, which I'm also fine with.	I don't really think about it honestly. I'm not sure if any of my friends even *are* struggling. My poly roommate made me crazy for a little while because she had a long term boyfriend, a girlfriend, and was casually dating 2 other people and still would come whine to me that no one wanted her...shut up...
Men on /r/askwomen, what have you learned while browsing this sub?	That most of them don't want to talk to anyone in college as they paid to study and not socialize	Father of an 11 year old girl checking in. Some time ago there was a thread about women and their relationships with their dads. "What do you wish he knew or did more" something along those lines. The takeaway I got from that was time spent together was the most important thing followed closely by just getting to know their daughters as people. The thread gave me a lot to think about.
Does anyone here NOT have body issues?	I like the body I have a lot. I could stand to exercise more and tone up though. It does help that my husband says he loves my body everytime I say something that I don't like. I learned pretty early that my body is nice, enjoy it while I'm young haha. I think the biggest change in my attitude came when I went through a bad breakup and lost almost 10 lbs on a body that was already under 100. Being so skinny was very scary. I don't recommend it. I like the way I look, but not the way my body works. Autoimmune sucks.	It's weird, when I look at individual parts, I can't say I really like any part. But looking at myself as a whole, I think I'm not bad.
What is your favourite quote?	"If you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." Not just about romance relationships, to me that quote means if you are not going to be supportive or at least be around when I'm going through a difficult time, I don't want you around when I'm at my best self.	"Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness" - Katherine Henson Also, I love Roald Dahl quotes. Here's my fave: "A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth, a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely"
What was the loneliest moment you've experienced?	Days like today. No one to talk to, parents who just don't really care, and a SO who says they love me but really don't. It fucking sucks.	Sitting here responding to this in my empty house while my friends and family are in another city hanging out for the holidays.
Ladies, what compliment do you often receive that you either completely disagree with, find inappropriate, or even offensive?	Everyone tells me I'm cute or hot or sexy or beautiful or whatever. I don't get it. I definitely was all of those things. 25lbs ago. But now? I'm a whale, leave me alone. It's annoying.	(I'm Chinese) "Your English is so good!" Um I'm a native speaker, I was born in England and have lived here all 24 years of my life. I would hope so!
What skill are you surprised more women don't know how to do?	Play video games at esports level. Don't get me wrong, I've had my ass handed to me by plenty of women so they're certainly capable, but I'm surprised that the videogame scene is dominated by men seeing as it's one of the only "sports" that is theoretically gender neutral. Edit - why am I being down voted? It's a fact that they're underrepresented in esports.	Basic auto maintenance, or at least doing some research before allowing auto service shops to completely rake them over the coals with unnecessary repairs and service charges.
I put on tights this morning and felt like a beached whale wrestling a fish net. Ladies, what is your least graceful moment of the day?	Shaking a full bottle of liquid acrylics, the cap came flying off and doused me in Burnt Sienna #7020. All over my face, in my hair, and on my shirt. I looked like I got bukakka'd.	I teach six-year-olds and have been having TERRIBLE gas lately. Fortunately, I am able to fart silently. Unfortunately, my farts smell DISGUSTING! The kids started to look like they were going to cry and kept accusing each other of "pooping". Shit.
If you could change one thing about women in general, what would it be?	I would eliminate their sense of entitlement, or in other words the "you owe/must do X, Y and Z because I'm a girl" attitude.	Make it so that they would only become fertile when they wanted to. Or maybe I would change that about men instead. Ideally without affecting sex drive.
How many of you laugh at your own jokes?	I do. It's kind of hard though, because my jokes are so ~~God awful~~ intellectually complex that I usually have to explain them 2+ times.	I'm fucking hilarious so I laugh at everything I say. EDIT: Dear god, 9 days after posting this and I've received my first Gold! I'd like to thank my Reddit mom, /u/ffreudiannipss for getting me to this point and to /u/ohnoimrunningoutofsp who gifted me this on a nondescript Saturday while I enjoy the White House correspondents dinner.
What is the most infuriating and frustrating argument you've ever had with a parent due to the fact that in the end, it was mainly about you being female?	A little late to the party and not entirely on topic. I'm a transgender woman and have always been very gentle/femme/soft/quiet. My parents raised me thinking I was a boy and were pretty contemptuous and intolerant of me not being masculine; I didn't play sports, I had zero interest in labor (such as helping my father and brother dig up tree trunks in the garden or build things), I had zero interest in rough-housing, I watched shows like Next Top Model, Fashion Police, and Sex in the City. Long story short, I didn't participate in a single traditionally masculine activity without being actively blackmailed/threatened into doing so by my parents. The funny thing is, my father always wanted a daughter. I shudder, looking back, at how I would have been raised if I'd been born a cisgender woman. My parents were pretty heavily invested in enforcing gender roles.	Every time my brother could be out at all hours of the night when he'd banged most of the girls in his social circle, but I wasn't allowed to be with my friends because "there are boys in that group!" Eventually I started going out whenever I felt like it, because fuck that. Still never banged my friends, still never got myself (or anyone else) pregnant. Can't say the same for my brother.
Is it just me or has /r/askwomen turned into /r/howtopickupgirls???	Oh please, like it was ever anything but. AskMen has been that way just as long, if not longer. My point is, this is nothing new.	Seems that way at some points in time, but I also see a lot of other relevant discussions here that I appreciate reading and when appropriate I appreciate participating in. I think a lot of the posts you're seeing that come off that way are likely not guys trying to "pick up" women, but men genuinely wanting to connect with women, but who lack the confidence of the understanding, or the knowledge of appropriate situational awareness. In my experience, guys who are looking for tips on how to "pick up" women look to other guys for advice.
What has been your most disillusioning life experience as a man?	I was in Amsterdam with a group of Jewish friends. We went to an improv comedy show that was in English. The actors on stage asked the audience for "Funny confessions" that they could act out on stage. One guy yells out, "I killed a thousand Jews!!!". The audience laughed! The actors actually went through with it and turned it into some sort of Hitler/Holocaust joke. We got up and walked out. It was the first time in my life I really, truly understood how many otherwise civilized people out there hate me for literally no reason other than being born.	Getting out of the military and realizing how little America cares about its veterans. I don't just mean the shittiness of the VA. When you go look for a job, they'll ask you if you have any 'real experience' (apparently leading 40 men with $10 million worth of equipment into combat isn't quite as important as being an intern).
Men who look forward to starting the work day, what do you do?	I'm an entrepreneur. I do whatever I want to do. As long as I'm able to hook it up to a business model.	I work in a brewery/taproom. I work with a great crew, so it feels like I'm getting paid to shoot the shit with my buddies.
Does it ever bother you to know that people in your age group are much more successful than you?	There are people not in my age group a lot more successful than I am, too. Doesn't bother me either way.	“The only time you look in your neighbor's bowl is to make sure that they have enough. You don't look in your neighbor's bowl to see if you have as much as them.”
When’s the last time you sent a text and regretted it immensely. How did you recover?	I got really drunk and decided to text my crush (who was also a good friend of mine) if he wanted to hook up. Luckily, i texted “want to book hop” instead..... it forced me to just admit my feelings for him the next day and we’ve been dating ever since!	I accidentally sent a flirty and provocative text meant for just my husband to a group text with my inlaws. I quickly got a private text from my husband panicked telling me that I made the mistake of putting that in a group text. My inlaws pretended they didn't see it, but they acted a little awkward around me for a few days lmao.
What hint did you actually pick up on?	None. PSA to women, stop doing this shit and getting mad when we don't see you like us. No one understands. Just say what you mean.	I asked her what she was up to and she said she was cleaning her room and sent me a pic of her in her underwear with a messy room. Been trying to fuck this girl for legit two years. Got the hint and headed there. Lets just say good friday 2013 was abso-fucking-lutely a GREAT friday
What's the best post by a clueless woman you've seen here?	I'd say all the women who come here to answer questions are the most clueless but that's just my opinion. I understand wanting to help but maybe if the person is explicitly seeking male advise that can be respected.	>I'm always terrified to go talk to guys because I assume they're already getting a bunch of girls bothering them and they'd think it was weird. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/56gyfl/what_aspects_of_life_from_a_mans_perspective_are/d8jdart/
What is one thing you think more women need to hear?	Nobody "gives" you an orgasm. It's your body, it does it in response to internal thoughts and external stimulus. The other person is just damn lucky to have been in the vicinity for it. Also, stop letting men pay for dinner. It only leads to complicated expectations and unequal relationships. Insist on paying for him or splitting the bill. Watch what happens ;)	You're allowed to leave situations that make you uncomfortable, you don't need anyone's permission or approval. Easy to agree with on the surface, but when put into practice it can be kind of hard to follow through with
What are your life goals?	I’ve already achieved most of them (career, house, child) so now my main goal is to enjoy life and prepare for a happy retirement	• move to a country with a better quality of life and warmer climate • get a job that pays well enough for me to be able to afford my own apartment and a retirement • make that apartment the coziest place on Earth • find a better life/work balance that would allow me to spend more time at the gym, read more books and write down short stories that I occasionally come up with • travel every now and then to see more of the world • retire as a slightly eccentric, active, ridiculously healthy old lady with tons of stories to tell and hobbies to keep me busy
Ladies; when was a time you tried something to be sexy, only to have it backfire?	This happened to my ex-gf, not me. We were going through a pretty long sexual dry patch that was maybe just due more to lack of communication and different sensibilities. She initiated kissing and feeling one night, and then excused herself to her bathroom. She came out in a leather-y S&M-looking outfit, and I just wanted to laugh. For one, that look isn't really my thing, although I can imagine some scenarios where that look can be sexy on some women. But *on her*, it was just too out of place and I couldn't wrap my head around why she thought I would want that. I felt terrible because she just took it off immediately as soon as she saw my expression. I just didn't see her that way.	I was riding him in platform heels, span around to do reverse cowgirl....clonked him in the penis. That or the time I tried to spank him when he was bent over and instead hit him straight in the balls. I am catastrophically clumsy and he's a trooper.
She says I'm being ridiculous, I beg to differ. I need outside opinion. Am I being unreasonable?	Women will forgive even the worst faults of an attractive man. Women will not forgive even the best virtues of an unattractive one. A high status man who talks with his fists (not that Chris Brown is actually that bad, she hit him first), is much more attractive to women than a gentle, boring loser. Don't push this issue so far that you become the gentle, boring loser.	Honestly you shouldn't let your gf ruin your vacation and if she feels that way about it, you shouldn't try to change her opinion just because of how you feel. If she wants to go to the concert, you could go to a casino or something and meet up afterward. It sounds like you have a great trip planned and you shouldn't let something trivial like this ruin the vacation. That said, I completely agree with you on the Chris Brown domestic violence thing, but if she's using her money and not making you go to it, I can't really see why you couldn't just let her go. In a relationship you're not always going to agree on everything, so why sweat the small stuff when something much more serious may come along?
If it were socially acceptable for men to wear makeup, would you start wearing it?	Fuck yes. I have seriously dark rings under my eyes even though I've triedn everything to combat it. I'd say I'm pretty young and I dont have any addictions/physical issues, yet I tried more sleep, less cafeïne, less alcohol, more exercise, drinking more water, more / less sun, etc. Nothing works. Other people in my family have it as well, yet all less apparent, and my sister can mask it with foundation. It's definitely something I'd change if I could.	It's hard to say. "If things were different would you do things differently?" Probably yes but I can't easily imagine it.
How many of you actually hate Mother's Day?	It bothers me how entitled moms become over Mother's Day. Ugh. Just chill out. I get it, you work hard, but come on.	i lost my first and only child almost 2 years ago. mother's day sucks. i will hate tomorrow, but i will still celebrate my mom
What's the best way to tell you that you're wearing way too much cologne?	Any is too much. I want to smell like me, and want to be with people who want to smell me that way.	"Hey I dont mean to be rude, but you're putting on too much cologne and it's giving me a headache. Could you please tone it down in the future?"
This morning I heard a guy catcall a woman on a bicycle. He was driving his employer's van. His behaviour disgusts me; should I contact his employer? Or just let this go?	Let it go. It's not your problem and I don't really know what the employer should do. That's just my opinion, it's one of those annoyances that happen.	If you decide to make the call and need to describe what happened, the whistle was probably a "wolf whistle." Just so you're not stuck trying to imitate the whistle at some supervisor who takes the call. :)
Which is best: live birth, pouch babies, or egg-laying? What makes your preferred option superior?	We lay eggs, though. I mean... you guys.... we do. OVAry... you know? OVulate? We lay eggs, they are just tiny and (probably) not as good when paired with bacon. It's possible I'm putting way too much thought in.	Pouch babies for sure! Marsupial babies are so tiny when they first emerge to crawl into the pouch, like little jellybeans, you would barely feel it. Then once they get big you wouldn't have to waddle around heavily pregnant all the time, you could let them out for a bit and take a break. Plus, you could carry your youngsters and still have both hands free to do other stuff. Marsupials have it all worked out.
How many women who've had abortions would still have found a way to have one even if they were illegal?	This question is like many other times I have thought of women in the past. I would have done whatever I needed to do to make it happen. I would have been locked up and key tossed away, I would have been such the troubled maker. I only know this because I'm getting in trouble in this day and age! As my Doctor was telling me a semi no on something I was thinking to myself, Uhg, I hate being a good person because I could so get what I want by this way or that. Really though, I'm not a good person, I just happen to fear prison.	Maybe only the poorest women wouldn't, in my opinion, find a way. And even then, those women might try the most unsafe and harmful of options. If it were illegal for me to get an abortion, I have money that can pay for travel and a discreet doctor. If I didn't have money, I would harm myself and use known household methods. If that failed, I'd do anything to get myself beaten up and hope that would do it. There's always a way, and it depends on how much info you can get and how brave (I guess that's not the best word?) you are to go through with using the particular method.
Do you believe there is such a thing as "the one" for you?	No. Perfect monogamy is a by product of Victorian industrialisation to support the male in his "duty" to work. Many cultures live poly amourous and inter sex lives/identities without a problem.	No, just mathematically speaking. I do think that each person probably has a small group of people they'd be excellently suited for, and a larger circle of people they'd still be pretty damn happy with.
How Do Men Feel Love?	1. I lose weight. Particularly around the wallet area. 2. I wonder where said weight loss is going. 3. I put weight back on.	Might be a weird answer but being in love makes me feel completely and totally vulnerable. And it’s a vulnerability that for once, I’m okay with.
What do most people overestimate or underestimate about you?	Overestimate: My ability to do a 9-5 job. I'm very skilled, but I work way under my paygrade because of my health. I can't progress consistently, and people are always disappointed in me even though I warn them that I'll progress so far and then likely crash. Underestimate: How fucking badass I can be. I got a large metal splinter in my arm and when they removed it I didn't cry out or anything. When you're in pain all the time, you just kind of manage it?	They overestimate my intelligence. I'm really not that bright. I just watch a lot of documentaries and full of useless information. I don't think anyone underestimates anything about me.
Has someone ever rejected having sex with you for something petty (like size of your nipples or what your vagina looked like)?	People don't reject because of petty reasons,but for personnal tastes. I surely had been rejected a few times, and it's not to me to judge if it's petty. The right man will enjoy my body	I have asymmetrical inner labia, and one side sticks out a little past the outer labia when it's not tucked in. My last boyfriend didn't completely decline to have sex with me, but he was very obviously put off the first time he put his hand inside my underwear. He later told me that it kind of freaked him out (his words), and that he hoped I'd eventually have surgery to correct it.
What's the best/worst treatment you've received at a hospital or GP?	Worst was probably when I was in the ER for severe dehydration after a bout of food poisoning. I was getting IV fluids. The nurse said they needed to do a pregnancy test. I told her I can't get pregnant, but she said they had to do it anyway. I was dehydrated and had only been hooked up to a bag of fluid for about 10 minutes ... I couldn't pee (yet anyway). I told her I couldn't go yet and *she threatened to catheterize me* if I couldn't give her a urine sample.	When I was in labor with my 2nd child, the nurse who was with me during the delivery of my 1st child years before remembered me and stayed thru her shift just to be there for the birth of my 2nd child. I was so touched, I will never forget that.
What is the dumbest plot hole you have seen in a story?	In Civil War, T'challa was already Black Panther after his father was killed but then has to go through the ceremony of taking a plant in the Black Panther movie to become the Black Panther.	I get really irrationally angry at the beginning of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie where Harry is seen studying by using his wand for light....then minutes later he’s convinced he’ll be arrested for performing magic out of school for blowing up marge.
Why do people sometimes think that fashion-obsessed women are unintelligent?	Because the same part of the brain that used for processing intellectual activities is required for fashion sense and the need to look "good". Am glad you used the word obsessed. same part the brain gets preoccupied when we need to carry out complex task. People expecially ladies who want look good so bad are usually mentally lazy. If you have ever wondered why many proffessors care a little less how they look, there you have your answer. When the brain is in a flow state, we tend to zone out of the externals and focus on inner layers of the mind. That is not the case with fashion obsessed women.	Our culture has a stereotype of nerdy intelligent people being poorly dressed and awkward. A lot of media focusing on fashion goes hand in hand with more shallow media (e.g. the fashion spreads and who wore it best type articles in People Magazine or Cosmo). Also, people might assume if you are devoting a lot of time to intellectual pursuits, you won’t have time for “frivolous” things like fashion. A lot of people are calling out sexism, which I don’t disagree with, but I think there is more to it.
Black Women of Reddit: What stereotype geared towards us do you hate the most?	I'm angry. I'm sassy. I'm ghetto. I could be a thief. I'm loud. I'm unintelligent. I'm close minded. I'm spiritual. I'm "manly". The only one that's true for me is that I'm loud lol. And my GOD I hate the, "Wow! You speak very nice. You're eloquent". That's a backhanded compliment; they expected me to sound a certain way JUST because I'm black. =A=; The fuck dude.	the stereotype that our entire being is sassy and ghetto. Recently, I was at a friends for game night, we were playing Uno. I simply but jokingly was like “girl don’t look at my cards” and her entire family mimicked me but made it way more than it was like i had said “GURRRLLL DONT YOU BE LOOKIN AT MY CARDS” when that’s not how i said it... at all.
Women of AskMen, what's the best advice you got from the awesome guys on this sub?	And it is now officially Mar 14th Ladies. You know what that means! NOW go forth and show these men in your lives what you have learnt here and repay that awesome Valentines Day he gave you last month!!	That guys like it when women take the initiative to ask them out, to initiate sex, and that men like to get complimented too. **Spelling
Women who wasted a lot of time in bad relationships, how did you eventually come out of the cycle and find the right one?	Why do women think that, after years of fucking your own lives over and choosing bad person after bad person, and procreating, and then leaving the mess for another man to clean up - is good practice? Why is it bad of a man to not want to date someone who already had a family and wants someone to fill a role, not be there for their actual character? Why is it good policy for women to create families, destroy them, and then wonder where all the good men are? What the fuck is wrong with women of today?	take your time when you date people. don't immediately start dating someone. stay friends for a couple of months first so you can really get a sense of them. my mistake has been instantly dating people and learning more about them during the relationship when I should've done that before we started dating. If I stayed friends for a long time before actually dating, I wouldn't have been in 80% of the relationships I've been in. Just slow down.

What food does your grandma make that is incredibly delicious?	My grandma is dead, but she used to make the best potato salad. Her dressing was beyond superb, too. She used to make a pork roast on the top of the stove in a skillet with foil over the top of it. OMG it was like tender porkchops wrapped in crispy bacon covered in pepper. She was southern. They grew their own vegetables. Can you imagine? Organic vegetables my entire childhood fifty years ago.	Aw, my grandma. My grandpa, her spouse, lover and partner of 60 years is dying this week. Everyone is gathered at their house except me because I have a young son to care for many states away. My grandma and grandpa were both fantastic cooks. My grandma did most of the cooking and my grandpa, the baking. He must've made his carrot cake 1000 times or more because it was requested by so many people at so many functions. But I remember my grandma's cheesecake too. She grew an beautiful, wild, amazing vegetable garden for years and used to cook from that. Her thanksgiving dinners were made completely from scratch. I remember her lobster dinners with particular fondness too. Yum. Good memories.
Has a woman you were seeing ever said something about you to your face that made you lose all interest?	I'm not a man, but I wanted to say that I once stopped talking to a guy because he told me he liked Nickelback.	Once a girl told me that she liked me having a kid because it kept me home every night and kept me from cheating. Lol. Edit: For those that were curious. This girl was a mutual friend on Facebook that I met at a birthday party. When she said this to me through text, my only response was "Lol". We hit it off at the party and I was disappointed to hear her say that afterwards.
What complaint about women are you tired of hearing?	I hate hearing niceguys complain. "Waaaaah, women only like assholes!" "Waaaaah, hold a door open for them, and they think it's flirting! "waaaaah, women go for broke guys with no job, and beat them!" It's silly. They blame women for not liking them. But, it never occurs to them that maybe women aren't into IT gamer nerds. They aren't being nice because they're good people. They do nice because they hope it gets them laid. Like no guy with a decent job that pays his bill ever get gfs.	The anti-girl gamer/"you're not really a nerd". Also related, guys or people in general that discourage women from being smart. PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU'RE RUINING IT FOR THE REST OF US. Girls that like science and math are rare as hell, it's already hard enough finding someone I can relate to without people discouraging them at every turn.
Mothers of Reddit, what does a great partner for your daughter look like?	They should be respectful, honest, supportive, ethical, and contribute to society in a positive way. I want them to have the same general goals and interests. Lastly, I would like to see her future partner not come from a divorce family simply so that her partner understands the hard work that goes into a relationship.	I want my daughters partners to love and respect them, and bring them joy. That’s all. Beyond that, it is entirely up to my daughters what traits are important to them.
My brother is falling into the hands of a gang, how do I stop it?	Throw a knife at the gang's hand. Your brother cant fall into the hands of a gang if its hands are disabled.	The gang is giving him a sense of belonging and purpose. You have to give him a better counter offer.
What are your typical jokes when you flirt?	You want sum fuck? (I know I'm not a male, but this was a line I received. It was hilarious to me.)	Usually I would just tell stories about times I fucked up and it was funny. Like the time I got stopped by a dude walking his dog who asked me for directions to a downtown street. Right over his head was the street sign for that very street, and I chuckled at his expense and asked if he was blind. Then I glanced at the dog and realized it was a seeing eye dog.
Have you ever been a late bloomer's first girlfriend? How did it work out?	When I was 18-19 I dated a friend for almost 2 years who is the same age, I was his first girlfriend. His biggest issue was that he wasn’t really close friends with anyone/ didn’t really want anyone close to him so that made it difficult to open up. Was sweet as hell and really put in time though.	Yes! I was 23 and my bf was 28 and I was his first girlfriend. He’s a pretty introverted guy and according to him, it’s not easy for him to open up to people and fall in love. He’s the most gentle, caring, funny, and kind person ever! I feel so lucky that he chose me :)
Is there someone who keeps coming back into your life in a quasi-romantic context, but it never seems to work out due to timing, geography, or other factors? What does this person mean to you, and what keeps drawing you to each other? What keeps you apart, and what do you make of that?	Yep, the first guy I ever dated. I was 13 and he was 19, didn’t work for obvious reasons lmao we talked on and off for 6 years, we’d talk for a few months and get really close then he would start an argument and not talk to me for a few months, then do it all over again. it wasn’t until the last time we talked that I realized I was completely over him. I was only attracted to him and liked the attention from him when I was a young lonely teenager, now as an adult I realize he’s just pathetic. It’s been almost a year since I’ve blocked him on all social media and I haven’t been happier	Someone I’ve known 8 years. It began romantically for about 2 years but didn’t work out—more of his volition as he would lead me on then would realize he didn’t want anything serious. We weren’t friends for a bit but gradually started being friends again as we got older, and I did not see him as that same person as before, and we have been best friends for the last 3 years. We emotionally relied on each other and I trusted him (my mistake). He recently did the same thing as years ago—led me on, then realized he didn’t want a relationship. I finally realized I deserve better from both a friend and a potential partner, and said goodbye, as much as that hurts. I never would have imagined my best friend would use me like that again, after all of our history. Sucks.
What is something about yourself that makes you a great partner? What is something about you that makes you a challenging partner?	Great: I am really laid back and I'm usually down for anything and everything. I like trying new things and going new places. I love sex and initiate the majority of the time. I'm a great travel buddy. Communication is important to me. Challenging: I call people out on their shit and people don't always like that. I can be stubborn.	Great: I make amazing baked goods. Also super loyal. Challenging: When my anxiety gets the best of me. I know I can't be logical at those times and it is a huge challenge for my SO
What is the toughest thing for you in a relationship?	Because I've dated men and women, ingrained sexism. Guys I date know I'm a feminist, but will often be unintentionally sexist or have preconceived gender roles in their head. The women I've dated haven't been as overt in their sexism, but their sexism doesn't affect me as their partner to the same extent since we are the same gender. But when I encounter it, I really have to remind myself that it doesn't automatically mean they are misogynists, they just picked up some crap in life somewhere and need reeducation.	Opening up. From my experiences with past relationships and dating I now feel really uncomfortable opening up about myself and just talking about myself, my past, and my life. If someone doesn't ask me something I'll probably never tell them. It's really hard because I want to tell my current SO everything but I don't know the time or place, or how to bring up I want to talk about my life story.
What is the most painful experience you’ve had involving your private parts?	Clearly I remember Pickin' on the boy Seemed a harmless little fuck But we unleashed the lion Gnashed his teeth and bit the recessed lady's breast How could I forget And he hit me with a surprise left My jaw left hurting	A centipede was hiding in my shorts and bit me in the dick. I cried for about two hours. Bad day.
How do guys feel about a girl wearing a hair bonnet to bed?	Why aren't you asking him? You're not in bed with r/askmen are you? And if you are, where's my slice? *Additionally, I'm black too, I have naturally tight micro twists, they look awesome. I've never, ever, in my life, been told or advised to wear a hair bonnet.*	I'd be sleeping tf would I care what you put on your head go ask your dude because even if every single user here says one thing or the other, that won't give you any closer idea as to what he'd think
How would you respond to a female friend asking you for mutual masturbation?	No, the fuck do I want a handjob for? She can DJ Diddles herself. I'll be fucking, because I'm an adult.	I actually straight up had a friend ask me to finger her once. I was over in her room and she eventually just was like "hey, I'm really horny, can you finger me? And then not be weird about it after?" It was chill. 10/10, would finger again. Still remain great friends.
Minority women, what everyday struggles do you face that white women wouldn't?	Being stared at, CONSTANTLY. I'm not particularly hot or anything, being a Chub-Chub, but I am pretty. People stare. I don't think they would if I was a fat white lady.	After speaking perfectly plain, Colorado-accented English to someone they say, "so, uh, you speak English really well." Well, I'm third generation American, so I sure hope so. Okay, it doesn't happen every day, but a variation of it happens often enough.
Married women, what is your greatest wedding regret?	Giving in to family pressure to have an actual wedding. I wanted to do court just us or elope. It turned into a court ceremony with families and a huge reception and I had the worst panic attack of my life at the reception and stayed in my friends car for more than half the time.	Cheaping out on many things, but most importantly cheaping out on photographer. A friend with a good camera swore she’s a good photographer. We ended up with like 5 in focus photos. Not even great photos, but non-blurry photos. We ended up dressing up again the weekend after and took a dozen way better photos ourselves with a tripod, a windshield reflector, and three ikea lamps so we have something to send to relatives.
Older Women of Reddit, what do you think is BETTER about today’s youth?	I was interested in people's answers. But I'm seeing a lot of "I'm not older but" Hard to find nice things to say about younger people when they can't shut the fuck up and let the people the question was directed at answer.	I honestly really like the current youth. You're as politically focused as the boomers were but without the selfishness. You have a lot of the cynicism of us Gen-x without the abject acceptance we suffered. And you have the same drive to deliver a better world we did. IMO a good balance of the two. Yes, there are a lot of the traits that mark every generation of youth - a bit too naive, a bit too simplistic, a bit too easily drawn to extremes - but with the starting point being as good as it is I think you guys will do OK. I just hope you guys understand your power and exercise it before it is too late.
How do you deal with your girlfriend being hit on constantly?	Dude, I have a similar thing (in bars and nightclubs, not on the street or anything). Gets hit on pretty much every night out we have like that. The first few times I was uncomfortable like you, and I guess in the early stage you just have to trust her, but it can't hurt to make sure you're around with her too. Nowadays me and my SO exploit the guys who hit on her. She'll take them up on their offer for a free drink, get the drink, leave them and come to me. Then we share the drinks together. Free drinks! And if a guys keeps being persistent she'll often come and kiss me. Once you get to this stage in the relationship, a "disadvantage" can be turned into an advantage :)	Just because the attention from males is new for you to see doesn't mean that it is new for her to experience, and that might be something to remember. You see it as a big deal but she just sees it as boring everyday life, probably a mild annoyance. You already knew that she could cheat if she wanted to, and that's true whether she gets hit on constantly or not. She knows how to turn guys away and if someone wanted to stand out to her that would be a rare person indeed. If you aren't worried about her integrity then this is no threat to you at all.
Ladies with chronic illnesses or mystery health issues, how do you deal?	as strange as it sounds, gratitude. millions of people around the world have chronic illnesses and pain, but don't have access to medical care either at all or at the specialist level, to say nothing of pain management, and have no choice but to work in their misery. yeah there are problems and the health system doesn't work perfect, but i can see a doctor and get my pain under control the very same day if it gets that bad, and i get a basic stipend for days i can't work. i try not to complain because damn, what some people wouldn't give.	Having a name for it and being able to find a tribe is helpful. I have endometriosis and am struggling with infertility because of it, and having other people stuck in the same boat as me helps keep me sane and cope and learn stuff. I hope your specialist helps you find answers soon. ❤️
How often do you worry about being considered creepy?	Never. You work on social skills and these things aren't a problem. Every once in a while I might show interest in a woman and she won't be interested. But why should they make me uncomfortable?	Pretty much anytime I'm near a woman, no matter how long I've known her. I think about it while I'm walking down the sidewalk (do I smile and nod as I pass by to show I'm not a murderer or does that make me creepy?), when I'm liking or commenting on a woman's social media (what time is it? how old is the post? Is she wearing anything revealing?), trying to figure out where it's safe to direct my eyes in meetings or social settings (how long should I maintain eye-contact while she's speaking? oh god did I zone out in her general direction?), etc. Plus being a black guy I'm 1000% hyper aware of how I might be perceived at any given moment, so I sometimes feel like I'm tiptoeing through a minefield.
How long were you with your SO before your first argument and what was it about?	Few months in. It was about the relevance of philosophy to physics. Ended in slammed doors, yelling, not talking to each other for a while, and just general pissy-ness. Stupid thing to argue about, I know. Most of the arguments in the beginning were like that. One of us is an MA philosophy student at a top university. The other is an undergrad physics major who listens to science popularisers too much. Not that they aren't brilliant in their fields, but they are just fantastically wrong about philosophy. We aren't together anymore (broke up just after the two year mark) but we are still close friends. Unrelated to the physics/philosophy thing.	Depends how you define debate vs argument. Debate I'd say w/in 10 minutes of meeting her - it's one of the things that attracted me to her in the first place. Actual argument - probably a month or two - though they became more frequent (and eventually settled down) when she moved in with me.
What’s your job and what’s a typical day at your work like?	I'm self employed. I typically meet with clients on Monday/Tuesday and then the rest of the week I work from home. I absolutely love being my own boss. I don't have to take jobs that aren't a good fit for me, or if it seems the client will be difficult.	Custodian. Start the work day at 3pm. Clean about 8 classrooms, take out trash, take a break. Clean another 7 classrooms, take out trash, go to lunch. Clean 2 more classrooms, 3 offices and a bathroom. Take out trash. Put my cart away. Get ready to go home by 9.
Single men in your 30s, how does your average weekend compare to your average weekend when you were in your 20s?	34 here. In my 20's I spent my weekends working during the day and hanging out with friends at night. In my 30's I'm very much into my career and often spend time working part of Saturdays. But I love my career so it's fine with me. In the evenings I hang out with my wife and we usually go to a movie or meet up with another married couple. So not much changed except 6 days a week I'm awake from 5am to 10pm. I'm happy with it really and I love spending time with my family.	Instead of going out on Fridays and Saturdays I only go out one night. And I spend the entire next day in the fetal position because I haven't learned how to drink for my age.
In hindsight, what was your biggest missed opportunity in life?	Maybe not my biggest missed opportunity, but i definitely think about it. I was walking across campus to class, and I crossed paths with a super cute girl who smiled and said hi to me. I said hi and kept walking to class. I sit down and realize I am an idiot. Maybe she was just being friendly maybe she also thought i was cute and I should have got her number. Guess I will never know.	Selling my ~3000 bitcoins when they were ~8 cents a piece (had just risen 1000% in like 4 days or something). I don't want to look but I think they are over 1000 bucks each now.
What are some things you do for your health and personal care that maybe not all men do or know about that you’d swear by?	I got to a chiropractor every six weeks and get worked over, keeps my back and neck in line. I also feel wonderfully sore. I also try to get a manicure and pedicure one a month, I spend my entire work day on my feet and my hands take a beating daily since I’m a chef.	Lately I've been abstaining more from social media to the point that I barely use it anymore. It's done wonders for my productivity and has helped my stress and anxiety to go down. Also stretching does wonders
If most gay male porn were made for women (like most lesbian porn are made for men), what do you think gay porn would be like?	Well, what's there to change? Porn is quite literally just for sex so I don't think gay porn would change if it was made for women + how women have different interests, some like cuddling and others just like the sex... So ya, I don't really think much would change or even could change Note: I don't watch porn, I don't get off my watching people have sex but I personally like erm.. Rough sex... So if I did watch porn I wouldn't want to see much cuddling.	See [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net) or [https://archiveofourown.org/](https://archiveofourown.org/) that is what a lot of it would look like. To spare you the time: more story, more foreplay, more "love" (cuddling etc.), more eye contact. However, the tastes vary greatly as you can also see when you look at the stories from the provided links.
On a scale of 1 to 10 (ten being best), how good of a catch are you? Why so?	7 you can't be overweight and be a 10 and I am about 20 over right now, but my GF is a 9 so maybe that makes me a 9.	Well a while ago some girl posted a picture of a guy who she believed was a 5, and I look kind of like that dude so I'm a 5. Average af
What is the most polite way to remove one's self from a date when the woman lied/tricked you about her appearance and you don't wanna advance?	I feel like you should confront her a bit and tell her that she doesn't look like what you were expecting and tell her to stop using deceptive images regarding her appearance so the situation doesn't end up happening again. Tell her that maybe someone else might like how she looks but you're not interested because you were trying to meet up with the girl that she used as her profile or posed as.	Straight up. "I'm not feeling a connection." Edit: let me clarify. This is what I would say to someone. To me it is about connection, I want to feel a feiry passion for which I want to fuck/or get fucked for hours. And/or cuddle. My point is be honest and upfront. Dont waste people time. She obviously wasted yours by her lies. You aren't being rude in telling her like it is. Maybe gays are more casual about it.
What is your S/O like?	What, me chubster/grumpster/trumpster??? Seriously, he's a bit chubby, not really grumpy, but he farts a LOT, lol. He also is really intelligent (he's a software engineer and can do stuff I will never get my head round), funny as hell, a complete softie and willing to put up with me ;)	•He is equal parts hard working and playful. He divides our time together evenly between harassing and cuddling me. •He is excited about his interests and will make you excited about them, too. Just ask him one question about brewing beer, his 3-D printer or his laser engraver and prepare yourself to be interested in knowing more. •Kind I sometimes have a hard time keeping an open mind about unreasonable situations and people, but have learned so much from him. He gives people and situations room to unfold and move a bit. He isn’t interested in judgement or criticism. He has a “let’s see how this works out” approach to everyone and everything.
How has your body changed after pregnancy?	I have stretch marks, weird boobs, and a little tummy pooch one year PP. But the thing that fucks me up the most is the constant back pain. Thank you, shitty epidural nurse.	Boobs are less gravity defying, small tummy pooch framed by stretch marks on either side, both my kids are boys and since having them I now get 3 little black hairs that grow just beneath my bellybutton haha and a few hairs on my lip grow in black, my hips are wider, but the acne and skin on my face has improved.
what is something that not many women realize men crave in a relationship?	* NSA blow jobs where swallowing is not optional. * "the porn star experience" * not being cheated on * not being taken for granted that we'd foot the bill for the date(s)	* Casual touch, hugs, eye contact or just being looked at. * Your undivided attention to just slow down, check in and connect for a minute or two when I come home * Occasional appreciation for doing routine stuff * Getting to feel attractive/desirable
How do you feel about the phrase, "women understand women and don't like women"?	Sadly spot on in many cases. I have said it before and I’ll say it again nobody hurts and tears women down and is as good at doing it as other women. We should be lifting each other up and encouraging each other not seeking how to hurt each other the worst. Sadly one of my worst favorite “groups” tends to be women. I’m trying to correct that because I know some amazing women and I’m a woman myself but women my age and I do not vibe well and when we do something stupid eventually happens.	Never heard it and don’t agree. I’m a woman and I love women and men. Only insecure women don’t like other women.
What's the coolest thing you've seen in someone else's house that you'd never want in your own house?	A massive shower with two separate showerheads. SO is a waterhog and is not allowed to share showers with me until we get one.	A good friend of mine has this massive, round waterbed with satin sheets that revolves on this platform. It's really comfortable and I sleep like a baby in it but it always feels like the pizza delivery guy will turn up any minute in tiny cutoff denim shorts and ask who ordered the extra large sausage.
For Women That Barely Date: What Are Your Reasons?	I’m ugly and im transgender. It’s not really my choice not to date. Edit: I don’t care about being downvoted but it sucks you can’t have a negative reason to not date here	It's very rare that I meet people I'm genuinely interested in. When I do, they're usually friends first that fade into something more. Dating a near stranger for the sake of dating in and of itself is not very appealing to me.
Pet Owners: What are some silly quirks your little friends have?	My tiny pitbull Harley Quinn has to pick up something everytime she's given a command, when she's excited, or a random moments. My other dog cookie likes to dig holes and stick her head then sniffs.	My boy cat likes to eat his dry food by picking it out of the bowl with his toes, one piece at a time. He also likes to pat my face when I cuddle him.
What is your 'jerk-filter' when dating/on early stages of relationship?	For me it's also seeing how they treat waiting staff or people who serve them in general (shop clerks etc.) Other than that, a guy can't be racist/homophobic/bigoted, support right wing political parties, abortion ban etc.	* the classic "how they treat waitstaff" - not just nicely, but also without any condescension and with appropriate tips * how he reacts to small boundaries or inconveniences - if it's small and doesn't matter and yet they react badly, how much worse can I expect them to react when it matters to them? * what their friends are like, including how they treat each other, how they treat me, and who they are in general
Askwomen, what's a question that you wish more people would ask you on a first date?	So, where do you see yourself in 10 years? There is something about hearing a person's dreams that show you a little bit about their character and how driven/ambitious they are. Also it tells you how much they know about themselves and their priorities. There is nothing more unattractive than someone answering to that question, "uh, idk."	"What do you love?". I had a guy ask me this on a date. It was a really broad question but a great one. It's different than the usual "What do you do for fun?" or "Do you have any hobbies?" because those are usually things you "like" not love.
Men, how would you react if this "sex strike" happened?	If it was not indefinite and was slated to last like a month or something I would support my wife's solidarity.	If every woman in America did it, it would generate change. But the people having sex with the anti-abortion crowd are probably on the same team for the most part.
What is your opinion of the #MeToo social media campaign?	Watching this thread: it's fine now, but it has a high chance of going to shit E: Good job everyone E2: nvm, bestof came in and fucked up everything for everyone. gg E3: for future context, just because someone says something that you disagree with doesn’t mean that they’ve said something against the rules. The report button isn’t a fucking “super downvote” button	Watching this thread: it's fine now, but it has a high chance of going to shit E: Good job everyone E2: nvm, bestof came in and fucked up everything for everyone. gg E3: for future context, just because someone says something that you disagree with doesn’t mean that they’ve said something against the rules. The report button isn’t a fucking “super downvote” button
Men, what is the thing that makes you decide to pursue a girl romantically or just friend zone her?	Generally anything that makes her seem particularly unhealthy is a no-go for me. Bad posture, bad skin, fat (and awkwardly shaped), thin hair, rotten teeth. Also won't consider her if there's obvious psychological trauma. I have never had a problem with sticking my dick in crazy.	A big dividing line is physical appearance. It might sound shallow, but I don't mean she has to be crazy hot or anything, just within the scale of what I call 'hot', which is pretty damn broad. &#x200B; Next it tends to be a mix of humour, comfort and conversation. Basically if those things gel to such an extent that you don't drain me at all, chances are I'll start to want you more. I can't want more with someone who eventually starts to drain me, it just doesn't work, no matter how good a friend they are.
What's the most improbable scenario in which you've taken a "can't be too sure" pregnancy test?	I had a tubal ligation and was not having sex. My period was late by about 12 or so hours (super rare for me, less than 6 or so times in my life has this happened) and I FREAKED! I wouldn't let myself take a pregnancy test- because of no sex and refusal to believe that I'm Virgin Mary 2.0, it just seemed crazy to give into that paranoia.... But those were terrifying hours before my period came.	I was about 19 and had started dating my current partner. It should be noted that we took things extremely slow, and had not yet had sex. Anyway, I felt super queasy and my period was late by a few days (which is not uncommon). I worked myself into a tizzy, thinking that I must have come in contact with my roommate's jizz in the bathroom or something, and that I was going to have to explain to my new boyfriend that not only was I pregnant, but it was my roommate's baby. Yeah, it was the beginning of the stomach flu, and I'm an idiot. My period came while I was riding home from the store where I bought the pregnancy test. Seriously, who thinks that sperm is just floating around in the bathroom, waiting to infect you with zygotes. Ugh.
People who were in a long term relationship and got dumped, how do you feel now?	3 year isn't long. You're young, you've changed and grown up, and I'd guess grown a lot. Better to break up now that in 5 years from now when you have a kid, and a house etc etc etc. Broke up with my long-term university BF (he was terrible) met my now husband almost 7 years ago, the best thing that had ever happened to me. If I had stayed with my Ex I'd be miserable.	First, I was pissed. Then, I was sad. Then, I pretended like i wasnt sad. Then, I was a combination of even more sad and pissed and motivated. Then i was less pissed, less sad, and more motivated. Then it was just motivated. Then i stopped caring. All of that was about two years
Man of Reddit, How do you stop a porn addiction that ruins your daily life?	Such a big struggle that people overlook and think it’s normal, had a meathead from over r/testosterone arguing with me telling me I’m a loser for not wanting to masturbate and telling me to get some nice pictures and do my thing, it’s not normal to watch other people have sex. That’s weird. It’s addicting and many people like it but it’s not good for you.	When people try to quit a vice, they often retreat into a new one. For a lot of people, this vice is food, but that can be counter productive because you’ll get sad that you’re gaining weight and retreat to the comfort of your own addiction. Find a new outlet for dopamine, something new to keep you busy. Whenever you feel the need, force yourself to the gym. This will help you in the later steps. Do your best to stay in public. Walking around your town, out a coffee shop, where ever. Just dont be alone in your room with a laptop.
Ladies who use dating sites, does it bother you when the person messaging you didn't read your profile?	Makes sense that it would be irritating, but when a guy knows full well that maybe 10% of the no doubt *many* people who he messages will respond, hopefully in a way that encourages more conversation, reading every single profile and crafting the perfect message for every single person is exhausting.	It's a signal that I'm not going to respond to them. Other things that will cause me to not respond: - Poor quality pics: eg. group shots not indicating which one they are, only extreme facial close-ups, only pics from a distance so you can't see their face, only angry face pics. - their profile isn't filled out or only includes clichés ("I hate writing about myself" "want to know something, just ask") - the message they sent is only a single line ("hey" "what's up") or is obvious copy/pasta.
(Trigger Warning, SH) Ladies of Reddit, to counter the ridiculous "Nice Guy" (TM) claim that, "It's only harassment if he's ugly but flirting if he's hot", what are some incidents where you've been creeped out or harassed by a guy you considered very physically attractive?	I'm sure someone must have already said this, but I do think there'd be some truth to that claim! I think that if you did some kind of study, you'd find that guys' advances would be more likely to be written off as creepy, or whatever, if the guys are unattractive. Whether that's because of women being shallow, or because unattractive guys are less likely to be confident/socially competent, I wouldn't have a clue, but I think there'd be some truth to the idea :)	When I'd just started speaking to this guy from college. He did the whole "i don't know why I'm single I guess I'm not hot enough", I said "Oh you're attractive though" and he said "yeah I'd love to stick my dick in you" That's not what to say on the first conversation.
What's the difference between a "shitty" or "trashy" romance novel versus a good one?	i think a lot of people like to just tack on "shitty" so they make sure everyone knows they don't *really* like X or Y. like when people talk about hate-watching something? it's part insecurity (afraid to enthusiastically like things deemed lesser by society), part internalized misogyny most of the time. people just love to shit on media targeting women, especially romance anything i don't call romance novels shitty, but i think the difference between a bad one and a good one can be as simple as tropes involved, publisher, and cover?	A good romance novel has a plot regardless of the sex. A trashy romance novel has sex regardless of the plot. (And usually the sex is boring or repetitive.)
What is the most immature way a SO has broken up with you?	Not a woman but my first real gf, think freshman year of high school, literally just showed up at a carnival we were supposed to meet at with a new guy. It defiantly threw me off considering we had been together for weeks and were hanging out the night before and made plans to go to the carnival together actually. She literally showed up with another guy with his arm around her and said, Sorry he's my bf now.	Ghosted me. We both had the day off and were watching movies together at my place. He left to go get us lunch and never came back or called. This was before texting. I was freaked out thinking something awful had happened to him. Then the next day my best friend said she saw him at his workplace (he was a waiter) and he seemed totally fine.
Ladies who have been pregnant, what's a bodily sign that made you suspicious of being pregnant besides missing your period?	Early pregnancy symptoms and PMS symptoms are both caused by increased levels of progesterone during the end of your cycle, so there's really very little to tell them apart. If you're pregnant enough to show symptoms, a pregnancy test will give a positive result.	I got out of the shower and my cat started licking my feet. The only other time she had ever done that was when I was pregnant before. I had not even missed my period yet. She knew before any of us!
What are your thoughts on the new Reddit as a "Safe Place" policy and the banning of controversial subreddits like fatpeoplehate?	First they came for the fat haters. And I said "good riddance" because they were assholes. Then they came for the racists. And I said "good riddance" because they were also assholes. Then reddit became a much more tolerable site.	Banning a subreddit does nothing but incite them, as we are experiencing now. Ban individuals, remove mods, even get the proper authorities involved if it gets to that, but trying to remove an entire community (I use that word loosely) will solve nothing. I don't know what they thought they would accomplish.
What has your SO done recently to make you feel loved, appreciated and/or happy?	I got home from a long day at work and the first thing I did was to spill out my freshly filled glass of water. He wasn't too happy about that, but he cleaned it up for me while I wailed in a corner.	He ordered from my favorite take out without telling me so it just arrived to our door right when I was commenting about being hungry. Woke me up by kissing my back.
Ladies: What are some things you see online that make you think, “Geez, the person posting this is definitely under 25...”?	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked for moderation cleanup.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
What was the worst betrayal you have experienced from a non-romantic relationship?	Found out my best friend was going to spend New year's Eve with her another friend instead of me and it did hurt me a lot, because it was the last New year's Eve I was spending in the city we lived in together before moving away. And what did hurt even more was that she didn't see what's the problem. It was 7 years ago, today we're actually not friends anymore and she sometimes asks and wonders what's happened - well, if she wasn't such a shitty friend and didn't disappoint me like hundred times, then we would still be friends. Some people are not worth your friendship.	My parents repeatedly created situations where my mom would have to choose between my dad and her kids and she always, always chose my dad. Memorable examples include when my mom kicked us all out of the house (ages 16, 15, and two two-year-olds) because the toddlers were crying and she didn't want dad to hear it, and another recently when she told my sister to keep quiet about being sexually assaulted by our brother in law because my dad thinks it was a one-time mistake and there's no use in hurting our other sister.
What was the most memorable thing your current or former SO said or did that "sealed the deal" to sweep you off your feet?	"I want to be super gay for you" Aside from being a funny thing to say, the sentiment was that he wants to do whatever girl things I want to do if it'll make me happy. It sounds weird but it was really sweet at the time	He went stomping around the prairies in -40 weather to cut me down a Christmas tree, and brought it back for me in the back of his tiny little car.
What are sexist or misogynistic things in society that people dismiss?	the mix of race with sexism on reddit, people are allowed to generalize about non white culture, but try to generalize about a white culture from POC POV, and you will get critisized to no end. Yeah Trump got elected, but you aren't white so you don't get be racist.	"Oh, their fans are all *teenage girls*" (implied; stupid, materialistic, unable to appreciate actual things or actually apply judgement to what they like) Actually was reading a really interesting article earlier that pointed out one reason some young girls idolize female pop singers and e.g. Disney Princesses is because they're some of the few characters or persons who are able to be feminine and still be at the center of their own story, the story revolving around them as the main character. That was eye-opening.
Do you have a problem with your girlfriend wearing revealing clothes?	My rule is this, if I'm giving other girls the attention her outfit is attracting and she's ok with it, I'm ok with it too.	I like my wife dressing sexy and as long as they aren't rude or aggressive I don't care if guys check her out. I mean, frankly, it would be a losing battle anyway... with her figure *everything* looks good and it would be ridiculous to get upset over men rubbernecking to look at her... I'd just die angry and tired.
Has a guy you liked ever been oblivious to your hints, signs advances?	Man here. Can confirm anecdotally. I am oblivious to everything in the romance sector. That being said, it's so awesome/ hot/ sexy/ amazing when the woman makes the first move. That is if I see it.	My boyfriend. Sooooo many hints. I'd stay up way late with him after our Shadowrun game when everyone else went home or to bed, just talking and cuddling him on the couch... things like sex and porn and books and future plans and how pretty he is... One time, I indicated that spanking was something I like, and he slapped my ass... platonicly. Just when I was about to give up, his roommate told me to just ask him out. I did, he said yes (after he figured out what I was saying) and we've been together almost a year now.
What can you eat a lot of without it adding up to a lot of calories?	You could eat stuff that is high calorie so it fills you up longer and the you don't have to or want to eat a lot of it.	Celery. Carrots. Sugarless gum. Salsa. Tomatoes. Spinach. Green peppers. Cabbage. Radishes. Most things I don't really want to eat (love tomatoes, though!).
What is a hobby/pastime your partner engages in that you find incredibly attractive and wonderful?	My partner and I take psychedelics together. I find it very attractive when we do “trip” together he can compose himself. Also our conversations, i find it very attractive that he is willing to travel into the “unknown” if you will.	He can fix just about anything without having to watch a video or read a manual. It amazes me I say some random thing is broken and he just says oh ok and 15 minutes later it's taken care of and I don't have to call anybody, pay money, etc.
What is the sweetest thing a SO has ever said to you?	"You are the most serious from everyone here". I was dirty, on a PC playing UT, drunk and with a beard too long to be sanitary. I still can't figure out what she meant.	It wasn't something she said. It was something she did. So I guess that means actions mean more to me than words. There used to be a time when her job required her to be at work earlier than I did, and my schedule was about an hour and half behind hers. So there were mornings when she'd take a shower, get dressed and ready, but before leaving she'd climb under the covers, straddle me, put her face to mine and nozzle me until I woke up. Then she'd leave for work and I'd get up and do my morning routine with the smell of her lingering in my nose. One of the best things in life, ever.
What is the classiest way you've been rejected?	Honestly, I haven't really had any rejections that I would count as "classy." The best rejections I've received have been pretty darn lackluster and mediocre, and the worst rejections have been pretty darn hurtful.	Had an OKCupid date, we had sex, it was pretty good, but nothing crazy (she was very hot, I was very nervous). As I followed up for second date, she said something akin to "So, I was thinking about it and I just don't really think we're a match. You're super cute though. This might sound weird but I'd be happy to set you up with a friend of mine." I declined, but appreciated the up-front-ness.
Would you rather your SO have a beautiful face or a sexy body? And why?	Body. Get her some expensive make up tutorials. That contour shit goes a long way. I'm friends with a girl who is a literal bridge troll but everyone thinks she's pretty because she's good at makeup. If she gets skilled enough she will start doing it different ways too and next thing you know your s/o looks like several different pretty girls	Face! Contrary to the saying "You don't look at the mantlepiece when you're stoking the fire." I like to look at the mantelpiece when I'm stoking the fire.
Ok men of Reddit, enough of these questions about women, lets get to the manly stuff: What's your go-to sappy song when you're sad?	bro.. i can't remember the last time i was "sad" or "moody" or "worried" or anything. it's human to have emotions and what not but sad? nope. Make your life what you want.	[I'll follow you into the dark - Deathcab for a Cutie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDHY1D0tKRA) I pick up my dog and sing it to him.
Hello men. Can you please explain to me what the gym etiquette is when it comes to talking to others, and what your own motivations are when it comes to talking to a girl at the gym?	a woman said "hey, i've been seeing you at the gym, looking good!" i got SO MAD about it, how dare someone compliment me!?!	I think the only things I say to people at the gym fall into the following categories * Are they using that machine/equipment much longer * Can I jump in between their sets * Do you know if anyone is using this or did the last person just not rack their damn weights * Nice job on the set/weight/progress * Can you spot me * Can you pull this off me if I royally fuck up * Does this leg raise machine look like I'm riding a jetpack when I first lift myself?
What is the best lifestyle change you’ve made?	Went vegan and started eating a high carb low fat diet. Life's just so great when I can eat my healthy ice cream for breakfast and eat as much as I want without worrying about calories. I'm honestly excited for every meal because food is just so delicious now. I also finally lost the stubborn 10 pounds I didn't think I could lose and most importantly knowing that I'm not supporting animal cruelty has brought alot of light into my life.	Going to the gym. I started about 8 months ago. I'm also really cheap so I feel like a gym membership is a waste of money... so what actually motivates me to go is that I am basically wasting my money if I don't go. I signed a 2 year membership. It does help me relieve stress, helps me separate from work (when I go after work), and gives me the alone time I crave.
What do you consider to be the difference between being sexually desired and being objectified?	As a man this really confuses me? What am I meant to do I don't want to objectify women but I'm always attracted to women. Most of who I've never met and probably never will and a lot of the time I don’t even really want too. Dose this mean I'm objectifying them? It objectification = attraction? Are women never attracted to men only for looks? I mean magic mike's a thing?	Objectification is: thinking about a woman solely as an *object* for your pleasure. She doesn't exist outside of the purpose of entertaining or pleasing you. Objectification is not: thinking women are attractive So, when you dismiss the thoughts, wills, desires, plans, ideas, and values of a woman and simply view her as an object that you can use for your pleasure, you are objectifying her. If you find her physically appealing, and want to get to know her as a person, you are not objectifying her.
How can a sexist man grow out of hating women?	You're not sexist... You were abused. It's perfectly normal to be suspicious of women due to your circumstances. You should definitely see a therapist about this. Cause you're not gonna solve this problem on your own.	You might want to talk to a mental health expert on this one. Because that's a lot of baggage to get over.
I've been thinking about having an IUD put in. If you've had one put in, what have your experiences been like, and what can I expect?	Mine was great for two years. Then something happened and we never figured out what, but I was cramped over in lots of pain. It got worse and worse for weeks until I could hardly walk. I had tons of tests run with no answers. I asked my OB if there was any chance it might be the IUD and he said maybe, we could remove it and see if it helped. Day after removal all the pain was gone. Would not get an IUD again personally, but I know they work well for many.	I loved mine!! I wanted to be off hormones so I asked for the copper one. It hurt like crazy being put in and also I had this really weird stress/emotional/pain/invasive thing reaction where I cried for like ten minutes afterwards. BUT since then I feel literally nothing, I basically never need to think about it, and it works.
What's a common opinion you see across reddit, but don't hear often in real life?	That dating and sex are rare and difficult to attain. Everyone I know who is trying to date is successful.	Forearms. I have never heard a woman outside of Reddit talk about a man's forearms, let alone consider them sexy. Surprised me.
Mothers of Reddit, were you ever worried about loss of identity associated with having kids? How did you overcome this?	No. Motherhood is as integral a part of my identity as anything else I've experienced. I don't have any family in the country to help me care for my kids so I've had to just continue creating the life I want with babies and children in tow. I have no choice, I don't have the luxury of family babysitting or paying for extra care so I'm 24/7 mama - it's been a learning curve, but I do make sure that every day we do at least one thing I want to do. Whether it's dragging the babies along to a cafe for a big old coffee before we hit the beach, or trapping them in a room with me while I do yoga, I've got needs too and while I mother through my needs, they still have to get met.	I made sure to take time for me. I started doing things I enjoyed and not feeling guilty for it. Yes, I am a mother but it's only part of my identity. I let it over take me as a person and I was miserable and lost. In order to be a better mother I had to take back the other parts of my identity and embrace it. Motherhood has added to who I am, it didn't need to take over.
What mental health cliche do you hate?	I have a poor follow.through of the brain synapse. In many cases that means the patient can have violent impulses. But its a myth that all patients do. In my case, its something like ADHD which makes it hard to concentrate. If I need to explain, ill just tell people I have ADHD so they won't be scared of me.	I hate those empty statements directed towards people struggling. Not a friend saying it but those "wholesome" posts. Like "You are not alone". Sometimes I fucking am. Especially with chronic mental health issues, sometimes you are just alone with it.
Have you ever lost attraction to an SO over something that was outside their control?	Yes. He was quite short but otherwise attractive and funny so I gave him a try. I just couldn't find him attractive though. I couldn't see him as a man. Also his dick was unfortunately proportionate. I feel so bad for the guy	Yes! One of the first guys I kind of dated right out of high school. Sweet guy but had a falsetto'ish voice. I really tried to get over it but no, just couldn't. I sadly did the fade. Ran into him years later and nope, still couldn't get over it.
What are some signs that your relationship with somebody is progressing from casual to more serious?	pooping with the door open. I'm 100% serious, we'll continue conversations from the bed room to the bathroom and maintain eye contact through out the whole thing	I think what I noticed, with my last relationship, was that she could literally show up to my apartment unannounced and I'd be happy to see her. We were so comfortable that things just 'worked' like that. In a weird way, when things get serious they feel more casual. When things are casual they feel more serious, if that makes sense.
(NSFW) Do you prefer tits or ass? and why?	I can't pick just one. For years I have been an ass man. Always dated women with smaller tits and a great ass. Then the switch flipped. My recent ex had smaller boobs and not much of an ass, but all of the sudden she went from a small B to DDD's in a matter of 6 months. I then became a tit guy for a while. I'm on the fence. Depends on the gal.	Ass with no tits beats tits with no ass every day In general perky B cups with a nice butt are perfff
How you feel when your SO "fishes for a compliment"?	My last relationship actually failed because i couldn't get on board with this annoying trait. In fact every time she'd fish for a compliment or any other answer via text I'd always send the fishing emoji back to her like a real jack ass. That and of course I'd "mansplain," as she liked to call it.	Would not affect me personally but i would feel sorry for her being troubled by such thoughts. I'd give her the compliment she's fishing for and in the hours following that i may throw in a few extra gropes/pinches *(if i know she likes that ofc)* and let myself get "caught" checking out her body. With my ex-GF it would usually result in her smiling, giggling and getting turned on. Resulting in sexy time. Win-win.
If you knew your friend is regularly secretly cheating on their boyfriend/girlfriend, would you tell them and potentially risk the friendship?	Removed as we do not allow simple yes no questions. If you expand in the body text it can be reinstated.	Removed as we do not allow simple yes no questions. If you expand in the body text it can be reinstated.
Guys, what do you think of girls who gently tell you upfront that they like you, would that be considered too forward or do men actually prefer this method?	>Should I tell him that I like him or let it progress naturally? Meaning "sit passively like a good woman and do nothing unless he takes it on himself." Feel free to be a little more proactive than that.	It's fine, absolutely no reason you can't be honest with him about your feelings. No one's going to be offended by something like that.
Straight men of reddit, how do YOU personally respond to incoming flirtation from another man?	If you have sex with men, you can still be straight, so I sometimes just have sex with them. I'm 100% straight though.	I once visited the Gay Pride parade in Chicago with a male friend of mine. We were both there to enjoy the spectacle and party atmosphere, and we're both straight. I've never been hit on so much in my life. I was never uncomfortable, I found the people very open and friendly and very understanding and accepting. My favourite moment came in the lineup at the Mongolian BBQ. The line ups for food could get pretty long, and I remarked to my buddy as we waited that, "There must be some way to get ahead in this line." The guy behind me said, "I'm sure you'd have no trouble finding someone to give you head in this line."
Men of Reddit, what do you think of shiny black leggings on women?	They are trashy, everyone commenting that they look good is just wanting to encourage women to wear leggings as pants so they can see ass better in public.	A girl at work wears these, An older lady complained that she was distracting the other male workers. I agree with her, it was distracting. But i'm not going to tell her she should wear something else. Because she looks hot in them.
Among people you know, do women sometimes treat their male partners in a way that would be considered inappropriate if the roles were reversed?	The dumb, incompetent husband is the only negative stereotype still widely used and accepted in media and marketing for a reason.	I know a few people like that. It's also a common joke that women have to "train" their husbands. I think that's ridiculous. My husband is his own person, I married him for the person he is. The only time I really ask him to change his behavior is if he does something that hurts my feelings, which is not very often. I don't see the need to boss him around like a child or a dog.
Hairstylists/skincare specialists/makeup artists/nail artists of AskWomen, what can us customers do to make the most out of our visits with you?	Last time I was at the doctor he told me when I’m at the hairdressers I should ask them to check moles on my head when my hair is wet. I’d never heard that before so I thought I’d add it here.	Makeup artist: BRING INSPIRATION PICTURES! People often try to describe the look they want...totally wrong. You have no idea how many people tell me they absolutely do not want a smoky eye when really, they want a smoky eye. They just don't know know that a smoky eye doesn't have to be black and gray. Even if there's 25 pictures on pinterest that you like and you can't narrow it down to one definitive "this is what I want," it'll at least give the artist a general vibe of what you want. The most stressful thing is when someone says "I don't know, I just want to look dramatic but natural." Just have some pictures ready.
Dads whats going through your mind when meeting your daughters boyfriend for the first time?	As a Brother with a lil sister. Just be normal, but watchful. Does he shake your hand right, does he look you in the eye when talking to you, since this is his first time meeting you he should probably call you sir.	Don't have kids old enough to be in this situation, but I can tell you my father-in-law's approach of saying, "So, have you fucked my daughter yet?" is absolutely the wrong approach.
Will you tell us your reccuring dream, and we can all pseudo-psychologically interpret each others dreams?	I will get into an elevator and head for a floor in the middle of the building. But it keeps going up to the very top. I start panicking and mashing buttons because it skipped my floor. The cable snaps and the elevator free falls down. I always wake up before the elevator crashes.	I didnt have a reoccuring dream, but a few nights ago i had a dream i was having a conversation with a mentally challenged person. They kept getting harder and harder to understand to the point that I felt frustrated and it was just noises coming out of their mouth. My frustration woke me up and I realized my sub-conscious was having a conversation with my fiance's high-pitched snoring. I woke him up laughing and we were up from 1am - 3am cracking up nonstop.
[Controversal] Women who get offended by other women breastfeeding (pictures, public, etc), why??	So, I have no problem if they’re breastfeeding under a blanket or in the nursing mothers section of wherever, but I’ve seen way too many moms with 2-4 year olds just hanging on the breast. And these kids like, stop nursing for a few seconds and you see full nipple. I draw the line there. That’s just not something I woke up this morning hoping to see.	I feel very awkward about it but I recognise that as a problem with *me* and how I’ve been socialised to hypersexialise the manner in which I myself ate as a child.
What is the Worst Thing a Women Can Say to Kill the Mood?	"Fuck that feels so good" -me "Yeah, I've had LOTS of practice" -her response I then proceeded the think about how many other dicks have been in her mouth.	Honestly, I slept with this one woman who would ask 'why?' during sex. She'd ask me to talk dirty, then follow my statements with why? Such a headfuck and a moodkiller.
What was your awkward moment with your daughters laundry?	That’s enough reddit for today .. way more talk about discharge than I ever cared to see in my lifetime 😒🤷‍♀️	My little girl tossed a new shirt covered in very fine glitter into the same load as my work uniforms. I grabbed my stuff out of the dryer at O'dark30 and headed into work. I got to be Sergeant Sparkle Butt for a day.
How would you feel about courts mandating one year of waiting after filing/before marriage rather than one year of waiting after filing/before divorce? Would that have changed your life at all if it was the case?	There are too many variables that are grounds for divorce; some are dangerous others are mutually agreed upon. The court should only be involved in matters of safety, custody & divisions of property if needed IMO.	I don't think the courts should be involved in that. Adult people should be able to choose to marry or divorce without any required waiting period on either.
What's the biggest style mistake you have made?	Not listening to my gut about abusive men. Which sucks, because I love humankind, I believe in us, & abusive men take advantage of that *every* time.	Early 2000s were a wild time to grow up so take your pick, really. Vertical striped flares in corduroy, cut up biker shirts, shiny cargo trousers, gold mesh disco halter tops, asymmetrical jersey skirts, striped and ribbed turtleneck jumpers, flowy dresses over flared jeans, shrugs (I mean what am I, 80 and at the opera), super low rise jeans with belly chains, camo everything, Avril Lavigne as a style icon, ties as belts, etc. I was a disaster and that was before I went emo, which was even worse.
What's something you did to try to fit in with the cool girls that makes you cringe?	Not a damn thing. I was the intelligent, goth/rock chick who sat in classrooms throughout school and made the cool girls worry. Hehe	Begged my mother to buy me Limited sweatshirts that were like $50 and way more than she could afford, because they were only what the cool girls wore. Freaking ugly sweatshirts too. Ate a bunch of oreos off a platter in the woods that the cool girls broke in half and rubbed dirt and pebbles into the white cream. In order to be a part of their New Kids on the Block Fanclub that met daily in summers in the woods behind our houses, I had to eat every single one while they sat there laughing at me as I gagged. I ate them all though.
Men of reddit, how would you differentiate a "bitchy" woman vs. an "assertive" woman?	I try to avoid thinking of someone as "bitchy" precisely because of the double standard that exists for assertive people of different genders.	Assertive is using the authority and respect of your position. Bitchy or bossy is making demands you don't have the authority to make. Being a leader is a skill, being a dictator is a great way to lose respect. This is independent of sex, I have women as bosses/co-workers that are great leaders, and I have men as bosses/co-workers that are bitchy. I hate the hypersensitivity around calling a spade a spade. If your leadership skills suck, you'll lose my respect. Your genitals have nothing to do with it.
As a guy, how do you approach your girlfriend if you need emotional support?	As a woman, disregard all the comments telling you not to open up, or that it's a bad idea etc. If someone percieves emotional vulnerability as weakness, then you need out because that's extremely immature and unsustainable. Nobody wants to spend their life not being heard. My boyfriend is very open with me, and I love that we can have clear lines of communication at all times. Relationships are a two way street, and you should be able to talk to the person you love about anything at any time and not feel judged or loved less. Some people are less expressive and that's ok, but if you need emotional support from your S/o, just ask, and tell them why. I feel so sorry for all the guys who think they can't open up, what a cage.	My bf stays still and gives me a particular look in his eyes. Took me a while but eventually I’ve learnt that it is his way of saying “I could do with a hug from you right now even as everything else feels like shit”. Many times, a simple holding of hands or a hug with a back rub is all it takes to remind him that I am here, you are not alone, be strong and let’s face this together. Yes, even after we fight. Someone’s gotta make the first move towards reconciliation anyway.
How do I not keep this fucking cat?	Does it really need to be said? There's no excuse for animal cruelty. NONE. Find a no kill shelter, or an animal rescue group, and give the cat a better life than it would have with either one of you two. Fuck. Seriously.	> Now my mom is telling me that if I go to a therapist, the therapist can license the cat as an "emotional support animal" Your mom could have done the same thing.
AW, what are some stereotypes a lot of men have about women that you've never experienced as true irl?	For me personally, most of them. The idea that women can have sex with hot guys whenever they want is particularly annoying because it only works that way if you're conventionally attractive. If you're not, you get ignored.	I have been rejected, even for sex. I have only once had a guy buy me a drink. I love my female friends and genuinely want them to succeed.
Men, how do you plan to care for your aging parents and in-laws, particularly elders who have failed to adequately save for retirement?	Just let 'em pass. Not your problem, you will have your own kids to worry about. Also if they're overweight, just let them die. Overweight people are generally more stupid and don't contribute much to society.	If they haven't saved, you're going to have to choose between the crap-tier care Medicare offers and bankrupting yourself. Try to get assets passed off ahead of time so that when they're applying for medicare they look as poor as possible.
What would you do if you were obscenely rich?	My family would never work again. I'd set up a shit-ton of low cost, no-kill animal shelters. Set up large animal refuges worldwide. Travel to sight-see, while rescuing animals from zoos and sideshows.	Buy a really nice place to live, give money to family and friends, give money to the place I volunteer at and I'd do a whole lot of traveling. I'd also do fun stuff like get a bunch of $50 bills and hide them in library books just to brighten random people's day's.
If you wanted to get a boob job, and your SO didn't like it, would you want to hear his opinion?	I'd think that he's entitled to his opinion and to state it once, but he'd need to realize that his opinion doesn't carry a lot of weight. Other things come first and he'd need to respect that.	While it is my body and I will do what I want with it, if we are in a relationship I want to know his opinion. My boyfriend asks my opinion before a new haircut. I think that is a bit much but he says that since he is changing his appearance from how he was when he met he values my opinion. I guess my point is you should take his opinion into consideration, it is your body and you should do what you want. If you choose to do something dramatic and he loses his attraction or something... well that sucks but you should know before doing anything.
Women who married "up", what has dealing with your partner's family been like?	My SO's family are all very attractive and I'm rather plain. It's only ever come up once or twice but the first time I met his cousin his grandmother teased me about being standoffish and shy because I was intimidated. No, I was only there to give my SO a drive home and I didn't want to socialize because my uncle died that day.	Fairly difficult, his mother often refer to my family as "low income". She has stated many times she didn't understand how my husband could live in my house and not become sick. It wasn't the nicest but it was clean. Has often explained how although I am use to being dirty, I should learn that her standards as they are much higher and I need not to subject him to my dirtyness. He is actually a slob! So yeah my MIL definitely looks down on her southern white trash daughter in law. I just do my best to avoid her.
My GF doesn't really have friends. How can I talk to her about it?	Making friends isn't a terribly difficult thing to do. If she wanted to, she would. Some people don't keep a big circle of friends because they just don't want them. There doesn't have to be a deeper meaning than that. I spend all my time with my girlfriend, because we live together. Apart from that I can count on one hand with finger to spare the amount of people I spend any appreciable amount of time with. I'm fine with this. People are a drain.	I don't understand what you intend to talk to her about. The fact that you feel guilty isn't her problem. If you feel bad for hanging out with your friends (which makes no sense), maybe bring her once in a while or do more stuff with her. Badgering her over her lack of friends isn't "helping" her. Why don't you just take her word that she's fine staying home alone when you go out with your friends? Allot of people actually like having time alone. My wife doesn't have a lot of female friends and she doesn't mind at all if I go out with my male friends. She likes to stay home and work on her hobbies alone or go shopping alone. Not all women are social butterflies.
Men who hit the gym before work, how do you get through the day without falling asleep?	Boy I'm lucky. I've a small gym at work so I do 45 minutes around 2 or 2:30 or whenever my afternoon slump starts setting in. Then, I have have some sugar and a coffee after that and stay productive until 6pm.	I half think its not the gym that did it, its the early rising. Getting up early without being in that routine isn't easy. You usually start work at 830, so maybe you wake up at 7 regularly? 3.5hrs out of sleep schedule is a big change suddenly. Maybe you're just not used to it yet or need to go to bed earlier. Just a thought.
Men, have you ever felt your standards dip out of horniness?	Kudos to you for being able to even get it up for a girl you're not that into. Personally, it isn't even an option for me. I cannot get aroused around someone I'm not really, really into, so lowering my standards isn't really an option for me. That's not to say I'm holding out for a model as such, my tastes are pretty reasonable, but I like what I like and if I can't get someone to fit the profile of what I like, I just have to go without. Not much flexibility there I'm afraid =/ Like, I could never tell myself "Meh, she's only a 6, but I'll do her". I have to be jerking off to her nightly to warrant the chase lol.	I feel like half the questions in this sub are written by 12-year-olds just due to the sheer obviousness of the answer
Men, what is your go-to when you're feeling depressed?	Do more stuff that scares the shit out of you. Fear is just natural response. Don't shy away from it. Next to that Depression is just your body telling you: "Dude you're supposed to do other things with your life." Conclusion... what you're supposed to do is in that area where you experience fear.	Meditation and breathing. I still contemplate things as deeply as possible, but remaining grounded in the moment is so much more important to me now. Asking "why" and trying to deconstruct what's making me unhappy can be an endless endeavor if I let it, so staying in the moment via mindfulness turned out to be paramount to letting go of those things and allowing myself to be truly happy.
What is something men do that women tend to read way too much into?	Fucking everything. I swear women just endlessly fret and overthink situations, guys will fret and overthink things before talking to a girl but once they're in a relationship you chill out, women will start overthinking in the relationship and just the most minute comment can become catastrophic.	Being simply polite is often seen as an attempt at flirting. It makes you think to what standards are they accustomed to if simple decency is seen as an attempt to woo them.
Moving in with 2 men as a female. What should I know?	Make them clean the bathroom equally!!!!! I've lived with 1 guy and 2 girls for the last 3 years and my gosh, the hair and grime that accumulates after bro-man hits the gym is absurd. He's one of my *best friends* but has not once ever gotten down on his hand and knees to scrub the dead skin, piss, blood, fecal matter off the toilet bowl. Edit: added word	My GF lived with me and two other guys in a 3 bedroom place many years ago. A few notes from past experience. - You and your boyfriend should each pay your share of the rent. With 3 people, each person should be 1/3rd of the rent. - Setup a division of labour before there are any questions about who should be doing what. - Generally don't live with friends if you want to remain friends. There are exceptions but overall living with someone as a roomate will eventually end your friendship (either actively or you'll just fade out). Edit: I should clarify that I mean being a roommate with someone you were friends with before being a roommate.
Have you ever noticed someone try and sneakily take a picture of you?	I know a woman that this happened to on the city bus. She confronted the guy when she heard the shutter, it escalated, then he got off at the same stop as her... Thats when he apologized and claimed to have deleted the pic. Thats when she slapped the phone out of his hand, smashed the phone into bits under her heel, all while yelling "fk you, you dont take pics of me without my permission." All the people around applauded.	Yup. In high school there was a bunch of guys who were always clustered around my locker so I had to step over them to reach it since apparently they're superglued to the floor for exactly 1 hour once they sit down. One of them pointed his phone under my long jacket to take a picture of my ass and started passing it around to his friends while I was still there. He asked me out later that year and was genuinely surprised when I said no.
Which fashion crimes do you proudly commit on a weekly basis?	Not sure if others consider it a crime but all winter I wear my Uggs and usually with fleece lined leggings as pants. I'm in the Midwest and winters are cold. Sue (suit?) Me.	my bra straps are very often visible. but hey, it's summer, i am physically uncomfortable if i don't wear a bra, and i'm gonna keep wearing tank tops because it's hot and my job doesn't include a professional dress code.
What annoys you the most in literotica?	21(M) here that loves literotica as it makes a nice change from porn. The stuff that I like to read isn’t necessarily like 50 shades of grey... its more like stuff you find on xnxx stories. I’m curious as to what women like to read and any recommendations to all time favourites?	Most of the male characters have the “most beautiful green eyes” and the women have “the deepest crystal blue eyes”. Every sexy dude on the planet can’t have green eyes!
Have you ever assumed someone's behavior meant attraction and made a move, only to find out you were mistaken? What happened and how'd you feel?	Opposite situation: men and women are often attracted to me because apparently I give up lots of signals that I'm attracted. None of that is conscious. I'm asexual, but also autistic, so I had no idea. My ex calls them my "victims". Edit: I'm heteroromantic.	Had a girl at work ask "would you take me out?" and said "I'd take you out" over the course of two days who turned me down when I asked her out. That was a confusing situation.
Is brushing your teeth a "private" action?	I hope you started hamming it up by brushing your teeth with your mouth wide open and tons of frothy toothpaste dripping into the sink after she asked you to stop. People like her need a reality check.	She is gonna have real fun with the next 3 years of dorm life. Teeth brushing i not a private action, I probably would have started laughing.
Askmen, how do you feel about anal?	i think that it's morally objectionable to have sex with the butt when there is a perfectly good vagina to put your penis in	My girlfriend really likes it, but I honestly don't really care for it. I don't hate it, but I definitely prefer her vagina. I do it to make her happy.
What crazy snack combos did you concoct as a kid? Do you still eat them?	As a kid I think I once put mayonnaise in vanilla waivers because I thought it might just be close enough to an Oreo. Yeah, I haven't eat that since.	When I was young I was dangerously underweight and always tried to eat more caloric stuff. I used to take one graham cracker and PILE on cream cheese to like a 1-1.5cm thickness. Instant cheesecake.
What do you all think of nipple piercings?	Nipples are so good naturally, I don't think altering that beauty is a great idea. I generally hate piercings, it's a major turnoff to me. To me, only cheap slutty girls have nipple piercings. I mean why would you get one if not to show it? If it improves your own confidence, go for it, but know that a lot of men won't see it as an advantage. Many will be indifferent because, well, boobies are boobies no matter what, right?	I'd say that opinions are going to be 50/50, so it's up to you. Personally, I don't like them. They just get in the way. My SO had hers taken out recently after 14 years of having them and I'm a lot happier without them there.
Do you ever get offended by the standard of men who show interest in you?	offended when they show interest, no. offended when they actually try to pursue me as if they have a reasonable chance, absolutely.	I'm not offended by men showing interest in me, I'm offended based on HOW they show interest. I won't get upset at someone mentioning it casually, in fact I'll be flattered. However, if you catcall me on the street at 7am because you think I have a nice ass, go fall off a cliff.
What things would you have done differently/prepared for if you had known your ex was going to break up with you?	I would have broken up with her sooner to lessen the blow. She stayed just long enough for me to care too much about her problems. I too often end up someone's free therapist who spends too much time worrying about them and sacrificing time and energy to them, all just to be repaid with 'things are a little difficult for me, I quit'	Not spend a shit ton of money getting an artist to make a portrait of us for Valentines Day, since he broke up with me the day before hahahaahahaaaaaa (Don't worry - I cropped him out, now I have a cool ass cartoon picture of myself)
What is the most pathetic/ridiculous thing another man has done in attempt to assert his dominance over you?	Some guy in a bar was walking around really close to all the guys and getting their face while smirking. When it was my turn, he came up to me, I strategically placed my feet in a certain way, he kind of tripped, fell and spilled his drink all over himself. He said “you want to fucking fight me bro”. I said “you want to fucking fight me!?” While giving him a death stare. He kind of shivered and cowered away. The bartender gave me free drinks for the night, everyone clapped and gave me $100% dollars and I got the 2 hottest chicks in the bar and had a three some and someone gave me their lottery ticket which turned out to be a 50 million dollar ticket and now I’m set for life and I married both of those hot chicks.	I asked a drunk guy to leave the store I was working at and he said " you wanna try me " ,I said "no" , he went "aa" and then left from the store.
Those who watch Bob's Burgers -- are you Bob, Linda, Tina, Louise, or Gene and why?	I am a super Louise, right down to slapping the perfect faces of people I like and resent for making me like them.	I'm a weird combination of Tina and Louise. A little socially awkward, a little sadistic. I have a friend who is literally Bob. It's weird but amazing. He was even Bob for Halloween last year
What book(s) are you currently reading?	I'm reading The Handmaid's Tale for school, about 3/4 done with it. Honestly I think it's pretty interesting so far but too bad I heard (from a friend) that the show was bad.	I'm currently reading **Stillhouse Lake** by Rachel Caine. It's about a woman who discovers that her husband's a serial killer after he gets caught, and is dealing with the aftermath of everything. I'm a huge fan of thriller/mysteries.
From reading all the the threads about approaching, the conclusion is that most girls are not very thrilled to be hit on by strangers. My question is, how did you meet your last boyfriend?	Met husband through friends, never got close until he started calling me and asking to hang out. Friends for a while, sex ensued, love got to us. Im one of those women who hate strangers. I have several very uncomfortable experiences from strangers approaching me, often drunk, and behaving offensive. I prefer the company of friends when meeting new people overall, just the way i work.	I met my current SO in school. I tried to ask him out a week earlier then chickened out. A week later I was going to hand him a note asking him to dinner and a movie but I chickened out and left it in my pocket. Later that day he asked me out to dinner and a movie. I took the note out of my pocket and wrote my number on it and said yes. (I saw that he kept the note, its in his safe. He's had it for 9.5 years now).
What are men's unrealistic expectations in regards to romantic relationships and where do they come from?	That we're all looking for our perfect virginal girl who will give us the best sex we ever had, on demand. Comes from porn.	Some men, including me in the past, can expect romantic love to fill their entire need for emotional intimacy. Like they save a lot of "stuff" for confiding exclusively in the people they date. Women on the other hand tend to have a wider range of friends they are emotionally intimate with. To me this comes from stereotypes about masculinity meaning stoic, emotionless, invulnerable and that sort of thing. I think all my relationships improved with learning to confide in friends more.
What's it like having sex with a pregnant woman?	Big tits, sweet breastmilk, and she was horny AF. My dick might be long, but it's not nearly long enough to hurt an unborn baby. Pregnant bellies are not like fat bellies. They're not particularly attractive or unattractive in my mind. Overall I would recommend it.	There's no risk of harming the baby, and sex can actually help stimulate the onset of labour, once she's near-term (relief!) As a male, I noticed my wife was much more into sex while she was pregnant. We did need to moderate the kinds of positions we used, so that they were comfortable for her, and that was a novelty since she was not that adventurous before. I wish we were rich enough to have more kids! LOL But, seriously, sex with my pregnant wife was some of the best I've ever had with her! Great memories.
How can I support my BIL through his divorce?	"I'm sorry that I didn't tell you fifteen years ago that my sister's a backstabbing slut"? J/k... Sort of. But that revelation which she confided in you would be a big help to him during the divorce process. Infidelity is usually frowned on in divorce court. Of course, you would have to take his side, and betray your sister's trust; but considering that she's in the trust-betraying business herself, I wouldn't lose sleep over that.	Offer to hang out with him regularly to help take his mind off things. Be patient with him. I'm sorry your sister did such a thing, and I ask you to inspire him so that he doesn't lose hope on life. Be a friend, be his hero, be his go-to-for support. If I were you personally I'd stick around long enough to make sure he ends up with someone who will treat him better, and make sure he's emotionally safe. Hope that helps. :)
What makes your average guy attractive?	Confidence and being a nice gentleman. Can’t believe how many guys I thought were cute came out to be assholes and then they were ugly to me afterwards.	According to some studies, most women think that most men are below average in appearance. With that being the case, you need to use multipliers to make up the difference. You'd be surprised how much having good posture and a nice pair of shoes makes a difference. Make eye contact. Learn something, play an instrument, cook, improv, woodworking.... Become passionate about something.
What is something that's constantly brought up on reddit, but you never encounter in real life ?	(surprised to see some brogressiveism on this sub wow) i've never encountered "misandry" that reddit loves to claim feminism actually is	Trusting a fart and pooping yourself. I have a pretty finicky digestive system and weird poops galore, but...I know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.
Do you ever feel like society swears men don’t have emotions and only women do?How has this effected you?	To be fair, women’s emotions are invalidated constantly. How many times have you seen a woman be called crazy or hysterical?	It does seem that the only two acceptable emotions for a man are happiness and anger. And nobody wants to be around someone who’s angry. I personally deal with this; I’ve held my emotions in for so long, it seems anger is the only one I’m comfortable expressing, so everything that’s not happiness comes out as anger.
I should've have realized when my boyfriend at the time said horrible things about his ex wife, ex girlfriend, and other ladies he dated, that once we broke up he would start talking shit about me. What has happened in a relationship that you overlooked but shouldn't have?	Hmm with one of my last relationships I said bad things about my previous partners but I have since had two partners and have not bad mouthed her to either. Right now I am in a long distance kinda stressful relationship so I bite my tongue with quite a few things in order to make the relationship work out. I probably shouldn't but I think only time will tell.	i had a boyfriend say "if you had your body, but (a girl we both know)'s face, you'd be perfect" and "i'll probably meet someone better than you in the summer". i was extremely low on self-esteem at the time, so i just agreed with him both times. i definitely shouldn't have. putting me down a lot = wouldn't have been a good relationship in the long run.
Men, how do you deal with the possibility you might be single forever?	Dude, lots of chicks into older men. Trust me if you take care of yourself you're gonna have it good up until like 35 years old. I see it all around me. Girls under 25 years old fall for older guys so fast. There's like the stereotype that older guys are more smooth and experienced. Your best is still ahead of you man	I’m in my 30s, still single, cant seem to find anyone to even go on dates with me. I deal with the inevitability of me being forever single by keeping myself busy. I have a motorcycle, I travel, I play video games, I go to concerts and festivals.
Do guys honestly notice nipples?	yeah, and i have preferences. in fact, I could probably describe a handful of women who are my physical idea of a wet dream. Bit it doesn't matter - If I like you well enough to want you naked, it isn't a big thing if your nips are different from what I would like. Sure, I'm shallow, not not _that_ shallow.	Unless they are REALLY weird, I wouldn't worry about it. Most boobs look pretty good. I know I said something to a GF when I was 17 that I regret to this day.
"we do not pick up on hints, ever. We are awful at it." How true is that?	Pretty accurate. I've had a gorgeous girl sitting in my lap kiss me gently on the lips, and I was sure she wasn't interested. Be blunt.	Just realize that all the subtle hints that women drop, guys have seen before from women who aren't actually interested. Sometimes it's just because she's friendly or likes the attention. You have leave very obvious hints for it not be big a big risk.
What is your unpopular opinion about women?	Because of the constant coddling they get, they never really truly learn right from wrong and treat men like shit and we have to pretend to be ok with it or else be labeled a misogynist. Only respond if you have something better than "b-b-B-B-but sometimes men are bad!" Yeah I know. And they actually face accountability for the shit they do. You will only address female coddling. Just look at all these excuses for shitty female behavior piling up. Exactly as predicted. Fuck it. You idiots won't tolerate accountability for female shit behavior and openly celebrate it while mocking men who fall victim to it and then somehow have the audacity to claim your precious m'ladies aren't like that at all!!!	I dont think they should lower physical requirements for certain jobs to accommodate women who may want to get into the job. The physical requirements should fit what the job entails, and if anyone can't pass it, regardless of gender, that job is not for them.
Men who are not planning for any children. Why?	Because I believe our society is about to crumble and I'll be dammed if I bring a little fucker to suffer the fall down of civilization. Also, I can't get a relationship to last longer than 2 months , so there is that as well.	My greatest solace at the end of a day of work is that I can go home and completely shut down and goof off until the next morning. The thought of going home and having yet *more* responsibilities waiting for me makes my balls unspool in their sac.
If a random man had to spend the next year of his life as a woman, what do you think would be the most surprising thing to him?	Unfortunately, we had to lock the thread due to brigading from other subreddits. Thank you to everyone who participated respectfully and in good faith.

I'm putting my dog down today; any advice on how to deal with it?	> we're putting my dog down around 12 and his age is just catching up to him. Wait what? Please tell me I'm misreading this, it sounds like you're having him put down because he's old.	Be in the room when the vet puts him to sleep. I've read so many comments about people never forgiving themselves for not being in the room. I'm sorry you are going through this.
What's the weirdest social interaction you've ever been part of?	I often encounter other humans who are quite convinced that something magical lives inside them. We spend a lot of energy protecting this magical thing for events we think will happen when the time comes for worms to start burrowing through our bones and brains. Or some human beans believe in this invisible magical creature composed of words they call a self and let such words lock them into unpleasant places. Human beings writing stories for themselves and others, creating wounds and walls for one another all because the words they heard and have to tell. Some humans love words so much, they go and kill other humans (any human, big, small, withadick or without) because some words they like more than they like other people being not dead.	I walked into the reception of a doctors surgery, signed in then sat down and waited. There was one other person there, a middle aged woman who obviously had some kind of learning disability because she was reading a Peppa Pig book out loud to herself. I very skinny woman walks out of the surgery and sits in the waiting area, 2 seats from the woman reading. The reading woman (RW) turns to the skinny woman (SW) and this was the conversation: RW: Hi what’s your name? SW: Louise RW: oh Louise that’s my mother’s name! SW: oh that’s nice RW: Do you smoke crack? SW: Yeah. RW: Oh. And that’s when I got called into the surgery and I never saw either of them again
What are you preachy about?	The whole HAES/FA movement makes me preachy because it's hypocritical, stupid, anti-feminist, and dangerous. I will definitely argue passionately against anyone who believes in that horseshit. Also dislike anti vaxxers and anyone opposed to equality.	You guys already hit the big things, so I'm gonna go with not putting your cart away in the grocery store parking lot. I yell at friends and almost got into a physical altercation once. Like, seriously, why is it so effing hard to return them to the little cart corrals?!
Queer women, how do you feel about celebrating Pride this year?	Hey folks. For those who aren't aware and keep reporting this for "specifying demographics," our rules ban "specifying *majority* demographics." It's an important and specific distinction. However, if you are not queer, or not a woman, you can still answer how you feel about celebrating pride this year without it being derailing, as long as you don't make your response about your male-ness or straight-ness. Thank you for your understanding.	Hey folks. For those who aren't aware and keep reporting this for "specifying demographics," our rules ban "specifying *majority* demographics."

What was said to you after, “You’re a great guy, but...”?	Your one ball is too big, everytime I go to lick your ass hole it slaps me in the eye, I'm tired of going to work with black eyes	“But im into someone else.” I thought it was a very polite and honest way to say no so it waant too bad
My co-worker just microwaved his fish dinner. In what ways has God blighted you recently?	FYI might sound bizarre but microwaving fish actually isn't bad - it's quick and it stays incredibly juicy, but you do miss the crust or browning from pan frying or baking. I hear microwaving bacon is also good. Marco Pierre White swears by it.	I experienced a sharp pain on my ass when pooping. Went to the doctor, turns out I have an anal fissure. For those who don't know, that means the skin inside my asshole tore open.
You guys that piss all over the toilet seat, all over the floor and dont flush; What the fuck is your problem?	Only will do this if the bathroom stall is absolutely disgusting in the first place. I will ensure that if a place makes an effort to keep their toilets clean, I will clean up.If the toilet is, well, a gas station, I'm not going near that shit (literally)	The one that confounds me is the giant turds left unflushed in the bowl. "I'm so proud of this one I just can't send it down *sniffles*"
I'm at work and the guy in the toilet stall next to me is watching porn. What's the most inappropriate thing that you've seen or heard at work?	Lol I jerk off at the work bathroom. But the sound is off and I never make a noise, and I only do it when the bathroom is empty.	I was training a new co-worker. And she kept "falling asleep" in the middle of me talking to her. I automatically knew what was up, but I just didn't say anything. Hours later near the end of our shift she went to the bathroom and didn't come out for a *long* time. So naturally, I went to check on her. Knocked on the door and no reply so I opened. I was genuinely worried. Well, there she was, pants down and passed the fuck out on the floor with her needle kit on the windowsill next to the toilet. She had OD'd on heroin. Had to call an ambulance. She survived thank god, but that was the last I ever saw of her.
Women of AskMen, what are some things you learned about the opposite sex from this subreddit?	Maybe that they should not give advice in AM because they aren't men. But I'm a guy, so, you know... I can.	I've been astonished to discover from this sub and Reddit in general that men are pretty much just as self-conscious about their bodies and how they are perceived by the opposite sex as women are. It also never occurred to me before just how terrifying it is for a man to approach a woman in a bar or club or elsewhere. I've never been mean to guys who approach, but reddit has made me very much more conscious of how much a guy is putting himself out there just to come over and talk to me--and I've been trying to be the initiator more (it's goddamned hard, though, I nearly peed my pants the first time I approached a cute guy a few weeks ago).
What is the quickest that a first date has gone bad?	The second thing out of his mouth was: "U2 is my favourite band. I've seen them in concert 12 times" Nothing wrong with that, but they are not even close to my favourite.	I went on a date with a girl my friends tried to set me up with, she insisted on going to Denny's at 2am and I fucking love Denny's at 2am so I agreed. what I didn't know was that she planned it at this time so she could go out drinking and show up shitfaced. she told the waitress to hurry up so we could leave and she could "get fucked". she ended up going under the table at one point and when I'm embarrassedly like *please stop I'm so embarrassed everyone's looking I could die right here* she proceeded to scream that she's just looking for my panties. also she drove there herself and took up like 4 parking spots.
What have you learned from AskMen this year?	A lot of you overthink how to talk to women. A lot of you overthink how to talk to people in general. It's not fucking hard, and the fact that you think it's hard to the point where you go into an online forum and ask for advice makes me question where the world will be in 20-40 years. Logically, this means a lot of you are anti-social loners, which is pretty sad but also makes me feel better about myself, considering I don't lack social skills with people and women.	That a lot of women really really want to ask that one guy out and absolutely would if only they had some balls. Truly, they try so hard despite their disability.
Why do you think boy bands are huge with teen girls, but girl bands typically have not shared the same success with teen boys?	Because teen boys are not that into pop music. Girl bands and boy bands are musically not that different. Teen boys would not threaten their just developing man hood by openly enjoying girly pop music. No! They will want the hardest rock or the most gangsta rap. Also girl bands really are for women. The tagline of the Spice Girls was girl power.	Because boy bands lyrics talks about how they just want an average girl who only has love which sort of connects with us Not the girl bands which is mostly about how cool they are
Shouldn't some sexual preferences be examined/questioned? Why do we treat preferences as some sort of sacred cow?	I get pretty frustrated with the amount of men who come into sex-positive, feminist spaces with a whole lot of unchecked male-privilege, and try to dominate the conversation with their ramblings about how proud and unashamed they are of their rape fantasies, and how "normal" and "natural" it is. Fuck you. I'm judging. That is not what sex-positivity is supposed to be about. You're not abnormal or disgusting as an individual for having them, but let's not be an idiot and pretwnd like our sexualities aren't constructed within a patriarchy and a rape culture. How DARE you come into a space that intrinsically attracts a lot of rape-survivors, and then misuse the space like that. That shit is TRIGGERING. The fact that so many men think rape is hot, is a DAMN PROBLEM.	There are sexual preferences that are normal. Being attracted to short/ tall people, small/big people, hair colour, eye colour whatever. Totally normal. Those are fair to be accepted and not judged, but there are two conditions. You cannot treat people you are attracted to better than people you are not attracted to. And, you cannot act like something that makes you attractive makes you better than someone else. That's where problems arise. Now, that being said, some other stuff can be judged. Children, animals are never OK. Not ever. These people should seek help and have help provided for them. Then there are grey areas. Submissiveness and dominance are both acceptable, but only in a consenting relationship with no other underlying issues. People who say that they're only attracted to submissive Asian girls are looking for someone they can take advantage of.
How old are you and what changes in female beauty standards have you seen during your lifetime?	People want big butts now. Butts are the new boobs. Also, for some reason people are obsessed with these big thick eyebrows on women. Makes me want to gag. To me, you look like a man. I like having some hair on my snooch. I shave everything "under", but I like to leave a patch on top. For a while there you couldn't have any hair otherwise there was something wrong with you. I just don't follow any of these rules. I like what I like and that's it.	Eyebrows are the big one to me. I remember in high school, a lot of the girls I knew plucked or waxed their brows down to almost nothing. Then a fuller look came back into vogue and everyone started scrambling, but I know one of my friends had plucked hers down so much they couldn't grow back.
Older women of Reddit: What was the key to your successful marriage?	Not a woman. Not married. But a great advice I read somewhere on similar lines was - Don't use sex as a reward you give your husband for playing along or start witholding it when you don't see eye to eye. It should always be about something that both of you enjoy doing together. Don't use it as a cookie to train your monkey.	Disagreements are going to happen. It is most important that when you least understand each other, respect each other. 27 years and counting. It is worth doing right, all the best to you.
What do women do at your place that you cannot stand?	Open a bottle of wine to drink just one glass (or less). I don't drink wine by myself, but wine doesn't keep once opened so now I gotta flush a whole bottle of wine down the sink just because she wanted one glass. The worst part is every time I try to explain *"look I don't mind you drinking wine, but I feel bad about wasting a whole bottle if you only want one glass, so how about we just go to bed/have some water/etc?"* they always seem to turn it into a fight about me being difficult or not letting them just have a glass. So much wine wasted. So much! >_<	Well, it sounds like you're only there on weekends, which is good. A problem I had with an ex was she would come over quite often and just sit there, either expecting me to plan something exciting, or watch TV (which I personally hate doing for long periods of time.) But yeah, your SO might occasionally want some alone time for a portion of the weekend.
How do you guys deal with feeling unwanted?	You have to learn to love yourself and enjoy time with yourself before anyone else will. Take yourself on a date go out to eat and to the movies	I still have no clue as to how to go around it. I'm the boy who nobody ever wants to pair up with science practicals. I was bullied and isolated extensively in primary school, and don't really have many people I can truly call friends. A handful at best. Never had a girlfriend either outside of two tries on an app, and am afraid I never will. I don't belong, wherever I go, and whatever I do. I'm OK with being on my own. It's how I grew up, and it's all I've ever known.
Women who don't wear makeup-why don't you?	I think it's a bit ridiculous? It's face paint. I'll do the face-paint thing when I go out clubbing because I'm trying to get laid, I'll do the face-paint thing for pictures because easier than photoshop, but I'm not going to wear it on a daily basis. Plus I have bad skin - it's really strikingly obvious when you have bad skin covered up with make up. Also I still don't 100% believe people who say that 'they're wearing it for themselves'. You mean to say if you were the only human being left on Earth, the first think you'd do when you woke up in the morning is make sure your winged liner was on fleek? I just don't buy it.	I hate how it feels on my skin, I don't want to spend the money or time, and it's inconvenient. I have a good skin care regimen of course, and always put moisturizer/SPF on before I leave my apartment but otherwise, no make up.
I often read on AM, "Don't take advice from girls about girls" Do you think the same is accurate about boys?	In heterosexual dating, women don't see all the required homework men have to do in advance, likewise, men don't see the homework women have to do in advance. So maybe, the best advice about dating men would be gay men, since they are both sides of the picture in a single person.	I often say, men should never take dating advice from women, only take it from men who are successful with women. I believe the exact same thing is true from women. Only take advice from women who are successful with men.
Dudes who drive around shirtless, where are you going? And what happened to your shirt?	Chill the fuck out. I don't have a/c I need to maximize airflow over my body's cooling system. I probably also just did something that would result in me drenching my shirt in sweat if I were wearing it, which I'm not.	When I lived in Yuma, AZ, I had a sadistic master sergeant who made us run at 2:00 in the afternoon through the summer. As the joke went, "it's 110 degrees in the shade, and there's no shade." My shitbox Civic didn't have AC, so I would *bake* on the way back to base. As a result, I'd usually strip down to my [silkies](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6c/6d/41/6c6d41a1059290dd7e76c1661102bf6a.jpg) and drive back to base like that. The MPs were not amused.
What was the most racist encounter you had in a country you visited?	Okay I've had enough of dealing with reports from this thread, I am locking it, your petty slapfights are over.	Okay I've had enough of dealing with reports from this thread, I am locking it, your petty slapfights are over.
Cliche event: Guy at party unknowingly kisses dude's girlfriend, why does the boyfriend get mad at the guy, but not the girlfriend?	Surprised to hear no one mention sexism here. I'm not one to cry "sexism" at the drop of the hat, but isn't this a clear example of assigning the man agency and control as the decision maker?	Probably because people would rather blame the guy in that situation was at fault than to believe that their gf would cheat on them.
What is your experience with getting permanently sterilized when you haven't had any children?	It's fine, I would just say if a person is really young, that they wait a few years to make sure it's something that they really for sure want. I've read that it can be very difficult to get a doctor to even agree to do the procedure for someone so young.	I did it at age 43 or so. Got the Essure sterilization procedure, the same week that folks filed a class action lawsuit against it (sigh). But I've been fortunate - haven't had any problems, haven't had any pregnancies. I wasn't given much hassle about getting sterilized - despite being childless, being recently divorced and in my 40s may have made it less controversial.
Men who explore abandoned buildings and other locations. What’s the craziest/scariest thing you’ve stumbled upon?	Came across some gang members in an abandoned warehouse. They had fire in their eyes and their words were very clear. They're out to get me, I knew i should leave I can but I didn't want to be a boy I wanted to be a man. I wanted to stay alive, better do what i can. I wanted to show them that I was'n't really scared but I was playing with my life it wasn't a game of truth or dare, but I wanted to be bad.	Some homeless dwellings. Few times when the "owner" was there (mostly very friendly when showed respect). Weird dolls and graffiti in an abandoned Asylum, but it was a popular spot so we expected other visitors to put them there. Nothing that scary or crazy. Cities are actually very safe unless you get shot. Which is still rare.
A couple of months ago I was talking to a girl who thought that men were just being pussies when it came to being hit in the nuts. After she said that, some of females in the group nodded in agreement. How common is this belief among women?	**Edit - that didn't really respond to your question... I really don't think it's a common belief among women. I'm generally of the camp that I'll respect your pain as long as you respect mine.**	I don't think that's true at all, the girl was either stupid or egging you on. We have a fraction of the nerve endings you guys do down there and I've been kicked pretty hard in the crotch (by a younger brother). If they hit a certain spot it's agony, and I know you guys have it worse. It is ridiculous that this girl said that, I've seen men throw up after being hit in the balls.
What's the absolute worst pickup line you've ever had to listen to?	It was from me: I spot a twenty-something gal at apartment complex pool reading a physics textbook. Me, a fresh college electrical engineering grad (and somewhat fat) see my chance: “I have some physics books in my apartment if you’d like to sometime come and look at them!” I don’t remember exactly how she said no, but it was tactful and polite. I think she moved out shortly after. I’d like to think I had something to do with that. Update: twenty+ years later and I’m not thin by any means, but not nearly as fat, and I don’t have the textbooks anymore. So all female sciences majors, you’re safe to read in public again.	First, and last, interaction ever with this bloke. I'd been sitting at a bar with my friend who left to go to the loo and he sort of saunters up (he had no business sauntering, let me tell you) and goes, "my cock just died, can I bury it in your pussy?"
Single Men of Reddit. What are some fun &amp; exciting things to do alone?	There's no activity that can get you where you want. It's a philosophical change you need. I would ask you this. Look at how your parents behaved together and look at if there were any childhood things that happened that kept you from learning how to connect. Activities are great and all but it's a mask. I actually saw this awhile ago and while i dont really od the PUA thing I enjoyed the 4 points of higher value which I always felt was true	I play a lot of hockey. I work out a lot. Video games are great. I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I'm learning bicycle mechanics. Netflix is fun. I'm learning to homebrew.
Have you ever became distant with a close friend of the opposite sex, simply because their SO didn't want them to be close with you?	No, if my SO didn't want me to be friends with someone and it wasn't for a valid reason, I would tell him to take a hike. If he had a valid reason, I would stop being friends with that person, not become distant.	I'm a guy's best female friend, and honestly, I'd INSIST he prioritize a potential girlfriend over me if it came down to it. He insists that any girl who doesn't like his friends should take a hike, but seriously- If it's someone he could potentially spend his life with, she comes before me. SO first, your best friend second. It's how it should be, else I've become the girlfriend (which I honestly feel like some kind of surrogate sometimes).
If you have been with your SO for over a decade, how has your relationship changed through the years?	My husband and I have been married for 10 years. We were together almost three years when we got married. What has changed? He came out as bisexual. I realized I identify as polyamorous and that monogamy leaves me feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. So now we have an open marriage. I've had another partner for almost 3 years, and my husband occasionally goes on dates.	Together 22 years this month. It's gotten better because we both know exactly who we are, together as a couple, and individually as people. We're stronger as a couple, because we can fix any issues as they pop up. We're having more fun than ever. The sex has never been better.
Ladies of Reddit, have you been so incredibly frustrated and misunderstood that you start crying? What’s your story?	I’ve learnt not to break down in front of people because they perceive it as being weak...heck if I see someone start bawling because of a relatively inconsequential event (so death/accident/trauma not included) even I’d mentally ask them to get a grip. I start crying out of sheet exhaustion and frustration AFTER the incident, in the privacy of my own home, preferably under the warmth and comfort of the shower.	I don’t handle people yelling at me or being disappointed in me very well, and I’ve been either wrongly accused or wrongly punished many a time and have just started crying instead of saying something. People usually say something like “crying won’t make me less angry” or “yeah I bet you feel guilty”, which doesn’t help.
Guys who married their first and only sexual partner, do you ever feel like you missed out on the "bachelor" life and if so, have you ever expressed these thoughts to your partner? How did they react?	All these people that say "the thought has never even crossed my mind" are so full of shit it makes me sad. Stop lying to yourself. It's completely normal and IMO a byproduct of evolutionary biology	My wife and I have only been with each other (she was also my first kiss), and I can only speak for myself but I 0 % feel like I'm missing out on anything. We have a great sex life, and I wouldn't change a thing between us - why would I look back at what could have been? No sense in eyeballing the Miata next to you when you're driving a BMW
What is the most cringe-worthy thing you have said to a girl?	When my ex and I broke up, with spite he said "these past two years, I could have made you cum so much more if I wanted to but I was just didn't care enough" that was salty	Girl: ugh I have to work early tomorrow Me: oh really where do you work? Girl: ... here She was my co-worker and we were at work . True story.
What do you wish you would have known before moving in with your SO?	Everything with my SO is great, but I'm not 10 years older than her. Seriously that age gap is a major red flag.	I thought you she would hold me up to her rigid standards; instead, she has sunk to mine. It is a hollow victory.
[Serious] Guys with intense feelings of inadequacy and self hate. Who/what brought you to this point?	**Your post has not been removed, this is just FYI.** AskMen does not moderate for the [Serious] tag like AskReddit. If you are concerned about your question not being taken seriously, you may want to consider removing it and rewording it. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskMen) if you have any questions or concerns.*	My ex, she blindsided me. Broke up with me saying she was just settling for me. Fair enough on her part I can't blame her for it i suppose anyone would do the same. Unfortunately it did put me down in the shitter for a long time, I guess being told you're not enough by someone you care about kinda hits hard well harder than I thought lol.
As a woman, whats an unpopular opinion you have on women or womens issues?	This topic has been locked because apparently the minute some of you hear the word "unpopular" you suddenly think this is some Purge like scenario and we suddenly stopped moderating this rule >No misogyny, misandry, transphobia, general assholery, invalidation, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary. We want this place to be comfortable for both those who are asking and answering questions. If you haven't gotten the picture, bigotry is always going to be unwelcomed here, and there is no magical exception to the rules. Intolerance is going to continue to be strictly moderated. Thank you, dsklerm	This topic has been locked because apparently the minute some of you hear the word "unpopular" you suddenly think this is some Purge like scenario and we suddenly stopped moderating this rule >No misogyny, misandry, transphobia, general assholery, invalidation, or otherwise hateful or disrespectful commentary.

How do you feel about men who don't take lesbians seriously?	Remember that these men are not representative of the whole of mankind. They're just the ones that you remember, because nobody ever remembers the things that don't happen. Pretty much by definition, the only guys that are going to have a strong reaction to your sexuality are going to be assholes. The ones who don't think it's a big deal and simply accept it just don't say anything about it one way or the other. It sucks that you have to deal with assholes, but that's life. Just try to remember that just because they're the ones making the most noise, that doesn't mean they're the only ones that exist.	See, I think straight men should have no problem understanding lesbianism. Personally, I don't find men attractive or sexy at all. And really, I can't understand why so many women do. Don't get me wrong--it's great that they do, and that some men are also attracted to men. But the idea of a person being attracted only to women makes so much sense to me, because that's how I am.
Men, once you have sex with a girl, what makes you want to stop talking to them?	I wouldnt say this is the case with a majority of men. try phrasing your question in a way that doesnt imply all men are assholes like you	When the sex high goes away and everything is back to normal and human flaws start to shine through again.
What makes someone boring to you?	If someone only goes to work and gym and rest of time watches netflix, yes they are boring to me.	People who treat a conversation only as a way of talking about themselves. Only listening to answer, never asking follow-up questions, not interested in your point of view
My boyfriend is the greatest guy ever...so why am I feeling like this?	This is something I observe in many women and it's probably the main reason why I refuse to be in a relationship. You could be the perfect man, nourish the relationship, try to make your partner happy and one day find out all this effort was for nothing. Stability is the woman's worst enemy. Could it be that you don't feel the thrill? Would fights, breaking up and coming back together, relationship problems make you want him more? Because that seems to be the common denominator of most of the long lasting (and IMO, destructive and disfunctional) relationsips I know of.	This may not apply to you, but a hell of a lot of people throw away something good because it doesn't line up with some bullshit they have in their head of "the way a relationship should be." It's shouldn't *be* anything. Stop thinking about anything other than this one question: Does he make you happy?
What movie or tv show actually made your blood boil?	Logan - when they killed the entire family with the kids at the beginning of the movie I was DONE. I literally sat on my phone the rest of the movie.	Abducted in Plain Sight. There are so many thing wrong with the characters I regret sitting through the 90 minutes...
Askmen, how do you break out of the 'Nice Guy' routine? Is it wrong to be kind.. what is too much?	Try to always be aware of the difference between NICE and GOOD. Always be GOOD. "Nice" is when you buy a bowl of ice cream for a chubby girl. "Good" is when you buy her a bowl of lettuce salad. "Nice" is when you do her job/homework for her. "Good" is when you convince her to do it herself.	Imagine that you're a leader of a country: You have to be polite, gentle and kind, but disrespecting you is an affront to an entire nation and you simply cannot tolerate that.
Non-white women of AskWomen, do you feel that society identifies you more strongly by gender or by race, and in which ways?	I'd like to see how this is broken down by class. A lot of working class women I know, who don't have a ton of education and don't work professional jobs, seem to feel race is more of an issue for them. My more educated friends, who do have professional jobs or work in white collar settings, feel their gender is more of a barrier.	Race. I'm biracial, although ethnically Hispanic My accomplishments, failures and behavior will be attributed to my blackness. My blackness will be attacked before my womanhood. I can only get a job or get into college *because of affirmative action* and the fact that I'm *black* If I get angry, I'm an angry *black* woman If I sleep around, I'm contributing to the lack of family unit structure within the *black community* When I'm told I'm pretty, I'm "pretty for a *black* woman" That's just how it is... EDIT: Without fail, the commentary regarding affirmative action and the insinuation that we can't get into uni without it are rolling in.
What's the longest running prank or gag you and your friends have done?	Rule one of playing Magic at the store I frequent - always piss off the salty/sore loser first. Then, if you can, win. It maximizes the hilarity levels greatly as one of them tilts out so hard after a bit of ragging that he starts making the entire table laugh at him.	For the last 8 years, I've been occasionally getting a call from my friend's ex who is in Nicaragua. She says the same shit every time and hangs up: "Kick the baby!" I don't trust any international calls.
Have you been right about having a bad feeling about a friend's boyfriend? What's your story?	It's bad being right and doing nothing, it's worse doing something but being wrong. Makes you look like a saboteur. I guess it's best to be careful.	Yes. I have a friend who was in a ldr with a dude living in a different country. they had been together forever and i was a newer friend so i didn't really want to say anything, but the way he treated her rubbed me the wrong way. He made her cry way too often during fights and I would hear stories about all of his close friendships with teen girls at his work. &#x200B; She did all of the work getting him to our country and on their wedding. About 9 months after the wedding he left her with a lot of debt and with claims that he was abused. to top it off he told her he was having second thoughts about the whole thing BEFORE she got him over here.
Whats the first thing you thought when you saw your SO for the first time?	"Thank God he's taller than me." I met him from Tinder and I had forgotten to ask how tall he was when we were messaging, and I'm 5'9 so it wasn't a given. I wore flats to the date and crossed my fingers! I told him later and he thought it was funny, so all's well that ends well.	"What a shithead." He had just accidentally backed into me as I walked behind his car in a CVS parking lot. We just got engaged last week!
Guys, when was the moment you finally realized that you no longer give a fuck anymore and how did that realization affect you moving forward?	I stopped giving a shit in highschool. But idk lately I think I’ve started to give a shit again cause I’ve met someone. Kinda sucks but whatever I guess	After my last relationship ended badly, I realized that I cared way to much about what other people think and I try to please everyone else before my self. I literally remember sitting in my room and saying " why do i give a fuck? " It was at that point that I realized, I shouldnt. I should live life for me and make my self happy regardless of what others think. It worked out pretty well, I own a house have a better job with a much better schedule, working on starting my own business and me and my beautiful fiance get married next November :)
Women of reddit who have been to prison, how accurate is the setting of "Orange is the new black"?	This show is SO on point. I literally got so many friends in it. I'd like to imagine it is so easy to get sucked in because it is such a foreign environment to us. I do think they have done a lot of research to carefully and perfectly put together the show. It definitely has changed my outlook on prisons.	My mother in law served a year in federal prison for embezzlement. We discuss the show often, and she actually loves it. She said it is really accurate, and that they way it shows that the system gives absolutely zero fucks about rehabilitation or your well being is the most accurate part. She said that the way that the prison divides itself by race is accurate, but she said she kept quiet and was nice to everyone to avoid trouble.
Have you ever found someone on Reddit you knew in real life? What kind of stuff did they post?	I found out a friend was a redditor when he shared a link from TIL on facebook. Never found him here, though.	Not quite what you asked, but my mother found me on here. She was in /r/raisedbynarcissists and saw one of my posts. She knew it was one of her kids, and I'm the only redditor in the family so she figured out it was me. She printed off my posts and showed them to everyone that we know. It was horrible. In the end, I decided not to start a new account. If she wanted me to tell nicer stories about her, she should have treated me better.
Girlfriend(18?F) lied about her age. What would you have done?	I think you overreacted, massively. Ok, sulk for a while and be mad for a bit, but Jesus. Tune down the hysteria a notch.	I’m a girl and I think that you did the right thing dumping her. If she’s lying about something so insignificant like age so that she doesn’t seem immature (even though 17 and 18 really isn’t much different), she probably is deep down immature and could lie about other things.
What's a typical work day like for you?	I'm an actress so a typical day for me is wake up, stretch and do a little bit of yoga, then head over to the theatre for rehearsal. Depending on the show and my role, what I'm rehearsing can really vary. I might at some point have an audition to go to in which case I'm rushing around the city. I might have a waitressing shift depending on my schedule that day too. When it comes to the performances then I usually have a more free morning (when there's no matinee) and will either work at the restaurant or look for other auditions/take classes/meet up with other people in the business for coffee (or just friends of course) Basically no two days are the same for me	I teach English in Japan. I pretty much either play games with kids or talk to old people about their grandchildren.
How often do you look at the butts?	Always. And if I fail to notice a good one, my wife will squeeze my hand to make sure I do.	If a nice booty walks past and it’s in my line of vision i’ll peep but i’m not trying to be super egregious about it IE craning my neck. Admiring a nice ass is one thing being a creeper is another.
How would you react if a stranger insulted you and your girlfriend in public?	Tell him his boyfriend wouldn't like him talking like that to strangers. Dollars to donuts if there's an assault charge it'll be his. My guess is he mistook your friend for someone else.	I've learnt one thing in AskMen: everything with the word "emasculated" in it is bullshit. If I had that happen to me I'd be amused that somebody is insulting us and proceed to troll him for more.
Does anyone else think getting married before 25 is just kind of... insane?	Fuck yes! I even go farther and say that having a serious relationship before 25 is generally a bad idea. In the years before, you're still learning who you are. If you're constantly trying to please and grow with some one, you aren't growing in an organic way. You just done know enough about yourself and the world before 25. I always have people say that it's harder to have kids around 30, which may be true. But that doesn't mean its not going to happen. You need to fill your own needs before you should concentrate on a child.	What was the point of putting all that emphasis on the couple being straight just so you could put "or gays" in parentheses?
[Serious + sensitive] What would you do if you knew your unborn child was going to have a disability?	Whatever you do, don't abort the baby. Have you considered the possibility that the doctors could've made a mistake? Before I was born, the doctors sat down my parents and talked about the very high probability that I would be born with down syndrome and proposed aborting me. Well today, I am a straight A college student. Just think about that.	Abort. Life is hard enough being a normal functioning person, bringing someone into this world with a clear disadvantage is just cruel to the kid, and not fair to yourself
What is a mundane thing in your life that the average dude would have NO IDEA the use of?	Tomatoes. I have been trying to watch my weight. Only thing is, before bed, I'm a snacker. I like to munch on food right before I go to sleep. It's a habit that's hard to break. So I get a couple of tomatoes. They are ridiculously low calorie. I can chomp down some tomatoes and still be under my calorie limit for the day. Thus far, I'm down over 70 pounds.	My SO was pretty baffled one day. When I stood up and put in a tampon, using an applicator. (He was doing something at the sink, while I was peeing.) Though in his defence, he'd never actually *seen* anyone use one.

Women past child-bearing age: If you never got married or had children when that is what you really wanted, how do you find satisfaction within your life?	I have kids and and find the wording of this question, implying a lack of satisfaction with a woman's life sans motherhood, to be offensive. I do hope that you didn't mean it that way. But even having kids, I find implying that my life's satisfaction revolves around them to be an incredibly limiting and one dimensional idea of me as a human.	ITT: Women upset with the wording. What if she said: Women who really wanted marriage and children but couldn't (for whatever reason), how did you fill that void? It's not that great of wording I guess, but I don't think she's trying to offend you all.
Other than "lower your standards" what advice do you give to other women who having trouble getting dates/sex/relationships?	Don't lower your standards. Don't settle. Find that guy that will treat you like you treat him. Advice: Stay Single Fuck Society	When going on dates, try to have very little expectations. When you go in with no expectations, there's less chances you will be disappointed. Go out to meet people and have fun. Don't expect things to go this way or that way, just go with it, go with the flow and only plan to have a good time.
Would you look at a woman's breast when she is breastfeeding in public ?	I think that everyone who would stare at your breasts while breastfeeding is a freak of nature. Or, at least, a BIG pervert. I would never look at a woman's breasts while she is feeding the baby. If I happen to see it, I will just look away. There's nothing wrong with breastfeeding in public.	Knowing me I'd probably freeze like a deer in the headlights until my befuddled the brain figured out what was going on, and then I would awkwardly turn away as soon as I returned to higher levels of cognitive function. Probably stuttering out apologies if I noticed you noticing me
How do you stop yourself from crying when you feel like you're going to cry in front of colleagues etc?	I don’t care how many down votes I get but to cry in front of everyone at work, just out in the open with out a care makes everyone extremely uncomfortable. I’ve worked with a lot of people who cry out in the open more then once a week or just regularly through out the month and it’s just ridiculous. Everyone can totally see you’re going through “it” as is everyone else on the planet. Trust me, I get it! I don’t want to work to pay my bills or have personal drama either. No one does. Try to cry on the inside like a winner or excuse yourself. The atmosphere you’re creating with your tears is unhealthy and toxic.	Eyeballs up, deep breath in. Also, I try not to speak to anyone too much cause as soon as my mouth opens the tears flow, so, I take a bathroom break till I can pull myself together.
Why is traveling viewed as so attractive and why do we emphasize it in dating and social media? Does it really make a potential partner more attractive?	When women say "I love to travel" in their dating profile, what they really mean to say is "I love to travel when you pay for it"	It's attractive to people who also want to travel and it's "exotic" to people who feel "stuck" where they are, or perhaps haven't traveled much. There's a lot of world out there. Some people are happy staying in their home town, some people want to go out and explore it.
Why won’t you just go to / call your doctor when you’re not feeling well?	All these answers, feigning toughness and sticking it out so you don't have to hear bad news. Bunch of pussies. Wanna show how tough you really are? Go in looking for bad news. Ask for that shit. It's fear that makes a man hide from the reaper. True courage is looking the potential of a drawn-out agonizing death right in the eye and walking towards it. Ultimately, get your shit sorted out or stfu about it. Quit complaining about the same ailment over and over if you refuse to get it looked at. You relinquish you're right to bitch when you refuse to do anything about it.	I have a lot of faith in walking things off. I wouldn't budge over a week-long sinus infection, but years of incessant coughing would certainly be a tipping point for me. That's like asking for bad news.
How do I START a relationship life at 28?	Don't be afraid to take risks. Take to every woman in which you find attractive. Be confident in yourself!!!!! And do not be afraid of rejection. There are Billions of women on this planet and I am 100% positive 1/4 of them would want to be with you some way or another. So talk to everyone you find attractive my friend. BTW, best getting to know them options that women love, Coffee dates. Public areas, they feel safe, they can really open up to you in an hour of talking to them. Coffee dates for me have turned into more dates in the future. GL my friend	I'm not sure why you think being attractive isn't important. That's a little bizarre. Anyway, you find a woman, ask her on a date, repeat until one says yes, and then go on the date. At the end, ask for a second date. Repeat until you have a girlfriend. Do NOT explain about your lack of experience. Do not self-deprecate. Do not say bitter things about women. All of that shit is brutally unattractive.
What would you warn young men about women when advising them about dating?	Love her but don't trust her - women are often ruled by emotion and there integrity is based in the moment unlike men who are loyal like dogs	Don't depend on anyone else to make you happy. Don't worry about what others think of you. 20 minutes with a condom is better than 20 years of child support and baby mama drama.
Would it be an issue if your SO didn't want to wear a wedding ring once you were engaged/married?	My parents have been married 33 years and my dad's never worn one. I don't care if my future husband wears one, because let's face it, a little piece of metal doesn't make a man honourable. I will probably wear one because I get hit on mercilessly.	Call me cheesy, but I think wedding bands are romantic. I don't see it as cheating prevention, but rather as a sweet gesture, i.e. "I'm proud to display that I'm bound to my SO for life." Yes, it would be an issue for me if my SO didn't **want** to wear a band. However, if he were in a particular situation in which wearing the band posed a danger, then I would demand that he take it off.
What are some signs of disrespect that you might have experienced in relationships?	Not answering calls or texts because of stress/busy/whatever. If I'm calling or texting my SO it's because I care and to ignore that is pretty disrespectful.	Always answering you in a passive way. It usually means you're SO is starting to get tired of you and doesn't even have the gall to tell you off. Usually leads to a huge bottling of emotions instead of talking problems through to fix them. "So how was your day?" "Fine" "You wanna go somewhere today?" "If you wanna go then go ahead" "Where do you want food from?" "You pick whatever place you want." "Hey is everything alright?" "I don't know is everything alright?"
Did anyone here who got in better shape feel more aggressive than when you were less healthy?	Dropped 70 lbs. I have more energy, I ache less. If I feel any more aggressive it might be because of the private MMA lessons I take. Still have about 40 more lbs to drop, so it could be things will change more around then.	It's not that I feel more aggressive specifically, it's that all these new muscles demand to be used. They don't really care if that's running up the 1 in 7 decline at work or punching some cunt in the face, they just want to be used.
I'm having a hard time finding a job. What did you do when you had a hard time finding a job?	From my experience, being picky lowers your chance of getting a job. It's not about preference. So long as you can pay your bills with the job, you gucci	Oof. Yeah, I've been there. My last job I got after sending out 155 applications. My current job I got after sending out 63. Nothing pissed me off more than people with jobs telling me to hang in there because I'd find something, but now that I'm on the other side, there's nothing else *to* say. Job hunting sucks balls, there's no getting around it. But no one, except for dead people, is jobless forever.
Who gave you the best blowjob(s) of your life, and what was the secret of their technique?	I don’t know if this counts, but for me it was a slut off of Tinder that was into really rough sex and wanted to be hurt. She would take the roughest oral sex I could give. Like rougher than you see on porn sites. I can tell you, It is something worth having.	I'm lucky enough to say it's the woman I'm currently dating. I don't know the specifics of what she does, but I would say one thing that really helps is she eased my guilt of just receiving pleasure by making it clear she's there because she wants to be/enjoys doing it.
What is the most surprising, funniest, or otherwise remarkable confession you have heard from a drunk girl?	"You're so cute!" "Omg, where have you been!" (when i showed up a little late) "You want a drink?!" "I love you!" All from the same girl in the same night, while we were out with her boyfriend. I've avoided her since; but I would absolutely love take her for a night.	She said she wasn't on birth control, but also hasn't had her period in over a year because she's dead inside.
Today my motorcycle broke down and a passerby asked if I had any tools. I said, "I don't need tools because I am the greatest tool in the world." and only later realised that I somehow managed to insult myself. Men of Reddit, have you ever insulted yourself without realising it?	Every guy in r/askmen who talks about pushing their dick down to aim while sitting on the toilet. You've just indirectly said that you are overweight and/or have a small penis.	My husband had complimented me on my soft skin. I said it was my lotion and to use some. He started rubbing it on his body and told me “ I now have the softest cock east of the Mississippi. “
Guys with 6 pack abs, does it make a difference when it comes to women?	It makes a difference when it comes to women who care about 6-pack abs. It doesn't make a difference when it comes to women who don't care about 6-pack abs.	Unless you're at the beach or have a shirtless tinder profile pic, you don't get to show her your six pack until you have it in the bag and it doesn't matter much then. But being fit in general, which shows more through your face, forearms, chest, neck and shoulders makes a huge difference.
What are your interests?	I really like playing RuneScape. Community is kind of mean, and its really repetitive at times but its the best MMORPG out there	Sorry not more people have commented yet but I'm into rugby and others are into (as I live in england) football/soccer. If you live in UK maybe that or American football. Generally keeping up with and doing some sports must be a good idea I think when people think of autism the gravitate towards an awkward albeano gaming kid with acne but I know this isn't true. Another thing I would say is try to be interested in whatever you want to be interested in, don't try to fit in too much but maybe if you talk to people about their interests you might find a mutual enjoyment in somthing. Hole this was a little helpful, sorry if not :)
Women of Reddit who don't have 'The Chair', what do you do with your worn but not dirty clothes?	I fail to understand how “worn but not dirty” is a thing. If you think your clothes aren’t dirty, put them away. If you don’t want to do that, you should probably wash them.	I have a laundry basket that has two separate bins inside so I use one for slightly worn not washable yet clothes and the other side for dirty clothes. Contains it all so no piles in sight!
Asian guys... how often do you get the "I don't date Asians" line from girls?	It's unfortunate but I can understand the sentiment even if it's not "fair" on you guys. As a white guy I know I'm significantly less attracted to black women in general. I might like them as people but in terms of average sexual attractiveness definitely below average white or Asian girls. It's just preference for me, Kudos for not being the idiot who mistakenly calls it racism though.	I kind of blame media portrayals of Asian men. So often it seems that an Asian dude is the computer nerd, or the villain, but almost never the romantic lead. Which is a shame, as there are any number of Asian actors who could step up to the role, and any number of Asian men who would make excellent partners. I know it's difficult to convince yourself of this, but if a woman is excluding an entire segment of the population due to racism, then it's really her loss.
What was your best father/daughter moment as a teenager ?	Unfortunately, I don't have one. He was arrested when I was 13 and in jail for a couple years. He is a mean, narcissistic asshole. Teen years was when I decided to end all contact with him.	We go camping together, sometimes we bring the rest of the family, but mostly we just take the dog. My Dad is...big, not tall, not exactly fat, just big. He was telling dumb scary stories by the camp fire and he decided to embellish the jumpscare by throwing the small axe we used for the fire wood at a tree. We couldn't get it back *out* of the tree. A few years later we happened back upon that camp site...axe was still in the tree.
Has anyone taken '23 and me' or other DNA ancestry test? How accurate was it and what did you find out that surprised you?	23andme’s business model is taking your dna and selling it to anyone who wants access to it. Think about the implications. The profit is not from finding out ancestry it’ll come later when they have one of the most important information databases in the world. when you sign up for their services, inside the fine print you sign away all your rights to your dna and give them the right to sell it to third parties	My older half brother (given up for adoption) was able to get in contact with us because he took the Ancestry.com one. It somehow matched him with my great aunt who figured out who he was and put him in contact with my dad. It was a pretty cool day when (with permission) he and his family turned up on my parents' doorstep
What was the worst mind game(s) a girl used on you?	WOW! I just want to say sorry on behalf of all women. Sometimes I think i'm a bit nuts, but then I read this and now I feel like THEE absolute perfect girlfriend in the world!	I had a girl pee all over my clothes once because she was mad at me for not paying enough attention to her. No joke. Sex with her was incredible but she was bat shit crazy and that was the last straw.
Men that decided to be single, why?	So I am excluding all the fwb, short terms and casuals since while they were an absolute a blast they are not relevant. Just relationships pursed as long terms: First long term: Ended in loss of attraction and was heading into dead bedroom so I pulled the plug. Next one: Dating was amazing but she was OCD to a pretty extreme level and I absolutely could not handle living with someone like that so I called it. Next one: She was an extreme extrovert and heavy partier and I am pretty introverted, we were mismatched and struggling because of it by the end so she called it. Last one: Both of us work higher end professional careers, she got posted overseas and I didn't want to give up my career so we mutually called it. Otherwise I suspect we would have worked out indefinitely. Current one: Steady as she goes.	I stayed single for a few years after getting divorced. Honestly it was nice to be able to do whatever I felt like doing. Friends going out? I'm there. Wings and beer for dinner? Hell yeah. Work til 7? Ain't nobody complaining but me. House a mess? Only if I'm the one who made it. Play video games all weekend? Sure. Eventually I started dating someone who fits in really well to the stuff I already like to do and decided to marry her.
What are your thoughts on bagels? Favorite Kind? Favorite prep? Favorite brand?	Montreal style > NY style; my favourite kind is whatever has just come out of the oven, with plain cream cheese or even better chèvre melting inside it. I make my own, so… My kitchen brand is my favourite? I don't need a new bagel flavour; I'm a bit of a purist and I'm more than happy with black-sesame, herb and cheese, and pumpernickel.	* I love bagels. * I'm a simple woman, I prefer plain. * I like them toasted with butter or plain cream cheese. I also love to make egg and cheese sandwiches with them. * I tend to buy them from my local coffee shop, so I don't have a favorite brand. I do like Breugger's though. Yum.
If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?	I wish I wouldn't have grown up in the church. Looking back, I realize how brainwashed I was by their morals and ideas. I fell victim to a lot of bullying for it. I was sexually assaulted by members of the church. It was just a bad thing for me. Now, my parents don't even go. Edit: Fuck you to whoever downvoted this.	I would have liked not to be raised in a bubble by helicopter parents. My mom has recently apologized for making me think that everything is "scary" as a kid. Couldn't ride bike alone, go to the park alone, go to sleepovers, etc. I was a very lonely, anxious child.
[Serious] After feeling you would never find someone as great as your last partner, did you eventually find someone as good/better?	**Your post has not been removed, this is just FYI.** AskMen does not moderate for the [Serious] tag like AskReddit. If you are concerned about your question not being taken seriously, you may want to consider removing it and rewording it. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskMen) if you have any questions or concerns.*	I have found someone better in every way. Unfortunately they don't want a relationship. It's a FWB situation and I'm probably gonna have to end it because...feels.
How often do you drink?	3-5 days a week. A bottle of wine a night isn't too bad, although what's his weekends like? > Side note/personal question: Would it be rude of me to ask him not to drink when we are out for dinner with my parents? I would bring it up that your parents brought it up to you.	Most evenings i'll have 2/3 pints of beer, on Friday and Saturday night that number will be closer to 8/9
What do you think of when you see the term "Sapiosexual" in someone's dating profile?	Makes me much more likely to swipe right on a woman. I value intelligence and, being above average intelligence myself, but lacking in physical areas like height (am 5'6) - it makes me feel like I have a much better chance of matching with them and hitting it off with them since their attraction isn't based in the superficial.	"I'm an idiot who is easily amused by big words". Alternately: "I'm a tool. I'm such a tool I should have Black and Decker tatooed on my forehead."
Guys, if you were with a girl who genuinely enjoyed anal sex, how often would you prefer to have anal rather than vaginal sex?	I'm not into the idea of anal, but I'm also not really against it, so I guess that would depend on how often the girl asked for it. Then again, I'm very much a sub, so this question doesn't really apply much to me.	Let me start by saying anal is my favorite. It's tight, it's a good hard orgasm for her almost every time, it's really my favorite. HOWEVER, it's my favorite because it's not every time. I play with her ass a little every time, but full on anal is not every time, and that's part of what makes it my favorite. She'll give me head or vaginal sex pretty much whenever I want it, within reason.....but anal.....anal is when I know she's really into the fuck, and wants to have a good hard orgasm. My answer is that if she WANTED anal all the time, by gosh she'd have anal. It's the bomb.
How did you unwittingly embarrass your parents or family when you were a kid?	When I was 5, my dad took me to a small cheese shop that was run by Mennonites (Ontario Amish sort of). All the ladies working there wore old fashioned dresses, little white linen head coverings, the whole deal. So we walk in, and they have every kind of cheese known to humanity in huge fridges along every wall. I was impressed. The first thing out of my mouth (in front of all these religious ladies) was, "OH, CHEESES!" My dad was embarrassed.	When I was a kid, I was really into this movie called Banjo the Woodpile Cat. There was a scene in which Banjo's father instructed him to find a "switch." I had to ask my dad what it meant, and he explained it was a stick for spanking. I thought this was HILARIOUS for some reason, and I always wanted my dad to pretend to spank me and I would just giggle. My family also would playfully tickle each other, because my mom and I are both very ticklish. One day (according to my parents-I don't remember this) we were in a park with other families and kids and my parents were talking to other grownups, and I found a good switch and started yelling "SPANK ME, DADDY! TICKLE ME AND SPANK ME!" Allegedly, my parents were absolutely mortified. Good times.
Fat women: What is your experience being the "fat friend"?	My friend's boyfriends wouldn't have any problems unleashing their fury on me, physically and verbally, because their girlfriends (my shit friends) got a kick out of it. But interestingly, the nicer ones always got dumped. I've once even convinced a girl not to date guy because I didn't think I would survive. My worst experience was having one of my slightly less overweight friends lose the weight. She'd been mean before, afterwards she was cruel. We'd been childhood friends but she changed so much we don't see each other much anymore. She's said she misses me but I'm not about to be her punching bag, even if it is for old times sake.	Con: Men ignore you and treat you like the gatekeeper. Pro: you never get trapped in conversations with strange men while out with your friends and other women don't get threatened by you. You seem funny, easy to be around, and approachable. Girls were telling me their secrets right and left Con: You lose the weight and some of those same girls start acting weird and competitive with you, passive aggressive and on edge. So your friends might not be the people you think they are. You are their "makes me look better and feel better about themselves" friend.
How long should a woman expect a man to last in bed? Do you feel bothered if a woman has a hard time getting off?	As someone who hasn’t lasted more than 10 minutes in years, it’s likely your choice of men. I’ve been single and selfish with it and don’t make a huge effort to last, most guys are capable of lasting if they make a conscious effort to. Guys who care typically stimulate with hands and mouth long before penetration to ensure the girl is satisfied. The less I care about the other person, the shorter our time is.	The idea I built up in my head is to always give the woman an orgasm through oral first and then go to penetration sex. That was she's already had at least one pleasurable instance and then spend the rest of the sex to make sure she's satisfied. I am a selfish person in real life. I'd like me to be a selfless one during sex. This is just my strategy though.
What's your "I'm an idiot" moment that has happened where a girl liked you but you didn't realize it?	Gave me a lot of free drugs, free beer, and responded to all of my flirting, didn't get mad when I spilled said drugs a bit, but I was just trashed so I didn't really keep up with what was going on.	I was out at a party one night when I was 19 and I started chatting to this girl and we kind of hit it off. Anywaaaaaaay, we're flirting and she says "oh gosh my lips feel so chapped, could you check if they're all right ;)" and I, literally with no hesitation, lean right in and get good old look at her lips with my eyes and say "NOPE, they look fine to me!". Haha oh man, good times.
When's the last time you went to urgent care or the ER? What happened?	I had a concussion for about a week and then it all of a sudden got really bad one day. Dizziness, extreme disorientation, migraine. Spent 4+ hours in the ER and over $400 worth of tests only to tell me I have a concussion and sent me home. Thanks, doc, I had no idea.	I was trying to sleep when I had this weird feeling on my left side. Felt a little discomfort and then it quickly turned to pain. It was gradually becoming worse to the point where even laying in the fetal position didn't help. Had my husband drive me to the ER where I then threw up because the pain was so bad. Kidney stones. I have never felt a pain so horrible. Luckily it happened Thursday evening/Friday morning because we left for the Dominican Republic that following Sunday.
Men, describe sex with a chubbier chick vs a thin chick. Which do you prefer ?	Chubbier is better. Everything is rounder and softer, even internally. Fucking a really skinny chick is like sticking your dick in that dryer hose that has those metal rings embedded in it. The only advantage of a skinnier girl is that her clitoris can be more exposed, meaning she'll enjoy the sex more.	Smaller makes some positions more viable, but bigger means more durable, making some activities a lot easier, specifically but not limited to kink and generally permitting a sort of greater amount of vigor. The diminishing rate of return drops off a lot narrower for thin, though. I'm not sure that I have a preference. I have fun with different types of bodies in different ways. There might even be a bit of 'the grass is always greener' going on.
What's your favourite video game and why?	The original Half Life. I have every step, every spawn, every boss, every gun location committed to memory. It was my first computer game. I had the old school SEGA genesis before my parents got a computer and bought me HL. The N64 came next with OoT. Gaming was my childhood.	Age of Empires II for PC. Along with the expansion packs. Fun to play vs. the PC (sometimes it was torrentially good, sometimes it was horrendously inept) and it had a great (at the time) multiplayer.
What’s one thing you’ve learned about women that has saved you a lot of stress?	They are bluffing. You let her argue with you. The negative emotion hurled towards you is actually a radar signal to determine how soft you are. I used to have people pleasing tendencies, low self esteem and low assertiveness, this got me burnt by an energy vampire. Never again. Your fear of not getting pussy is the gift of power, if you know what you want, have solid boundaries, and confidence, their manipulation can not work. End of story.	They are far more concerned with their safety than men, first step with all women is to make them feel safe around you.
What's a telltale signs that a male character is written by a woman and female character is written by a man?	As a guy, sorry if I'm not suppose to reply but I feel its relevant. I don't read much but listened to goldfinch and hunger games. It felt like the males we written by females because of the way they think so emotionally and with detail. Maybe its just my mind but i feel guys should be written more instinct or reason. It been a while since so take my opinion with a grain of salt.	An English teacher of mine pointed this one out. Men describe women using fruit (cherry lips, pear shaped hips, apples in cheeks, etc.) Once she pointed this out I cringe every time I read a fruit-based description of a woman.
Do you feel comfortable giving ''instructions'' to a guy when he performs oral sex to you?	Yes, it's important to me, and yes, I communicate with my partner when I have sex because I'm an adult and that's what adults do.	Like, the very first time? No, I usually just feel him out to see how he does it. After that, assuming he didn't get me off the first time? Absolutely.
What do you find unattractive what most others find attractive in women?	Fat asses. I like a nicely proportioned ass but if it's droopy and cellulite-y, I'm not a fan. Also big boobs. There's a point where they start to get gross.	Whatever you call the aesthetic that Kylie Jenner sets as the modern "standard". I hate caked makeup, gigantic lips, and whatever else is a component of that look. EDIT: Holy smokes, this blew up! Good to know other people feel the same way!
Women who've dated both men and women, do you feel the beauty expectations were different? If so, how?	Guy here. I like my women shaved as well, but would not go so far to downright demand it from them. My current girlfriend always rants about how she needs to shave again and doesn't really want to (because lots of effort). Even though i would prefer her shaved clean, i really don't mind if she doesn't shave for quite some time. Like most women, she has a very good hygiene and she'll shave anyways sometimes down the road. Sometimes she even points out her armpit hair and says "uh gross, i need to shave" and i'm like "ok?". It's weird to read how many guys demand freshly shaved bodies on a daily basis. I mean, i love my girlfriend - shaved or unshaved.	My sample size is too small, but I've been lucky. My boyfriend doesn't like body hair on me, but he doesn't like it on himself either. The woman I dated didn't care at all for either of us, which I liked because it mirrors how I feel. Neither gave a shit about makeup or hair stuff. I do think it's probably more common for men to expect things from women that they don't do for themselves than it is for a woman to expect it from another woman if she *herself* doesn't do it.
Men of Reddit, how has Tinder been going for you ? Any good experiences ? Advice ?	From about 2012/13-2016/17 tinder was fucking fantastic, probably close to 40 lays off it, including 2 of my top 3 hottest girls, but the last year or so its been pretty brutal. The girls that are DTF are ugly as sin, and basically zero girls on there that seem like they would be LTR material. Honestly its heydey has come and gone, I'd stay away from it unless you are in college and just looking to get laid. Now, I will say, in the past couple months I have been traveling a lot more for work and THAT is where tinder is a goldmine. I'm gonna be chilling by myself the entire week anyway, so if i can get a hookup and or a dinner date why not? My company pays for it anyways, and I already got a hotel.	A girl once tried to recruit me in a pyramidal scheme. Otherwise, I got nothing else to say. Oh wait, I also remember one girl saying I was going too fast when I invited her for coffee.
What were some obvious (in hindsight) red flags that your SO didn’t love you anymore?	They're all controlling and Snoopy to varying degrees. You won't really know until you live with them. Oh and they definitely get much better over time.	He stopped wanting to spend birthdays and holidays together and called me clingy when I asked him why. He put a password lock on his phone and would turn it away from me when he was on it. Despite that, I caught him flirting with another girl on his phone. He said it was harmless. The final red flag was raised when I went to visit him on his day off and his mother (who I only met a handful of times) greeted me at the door and congratulated me on my pregnancy. When I confronted him about who he impregnated, he told me I misunderstood his mother and said I was ruining our relationship with my distrust. I think his son is about 8 years old now? The gaslighting with that guy was incredible... only to be outdone by my denial.
What are the most confusing "signals" a girl has given you?	If I try talking to her in office, she ignores me. If I ignore her the next day, she explicitly shows her sadness. Okay, so I start talking with her again, and ....... These answers are probably going to help me too :-) :-(	A woman once stayed the night in my bed. She grabbed my thigh and started masturbating. Turns out she wasn't interested. That was ... awkward.
Do any of you also experience a female "refractory period"?	I have different parts down there, but once I get off I'm done and dont' want anything to continue. Then I will nap.	If I orgasm from clitoral stimulation, then my clit CANNOT be touched if we are going into PIV. I don't enjoy PIV as much afterward because my clitoral orgasms are REALLY intense and my come down time can last 5-10mins. I have a hard time focusing on whats happening right afterwards.
Former thong wearers, what made you stop?	I do it for working out. Under workout clothes, of course. Oh, what made me stop? I should read questions before I answer because I am wearing one now. Dang.	I wore thongs exclusively before I had a baby. Then I got hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids and thongs do NOT mix, let's just leave it at that.
Ladies who disliked their engagement ring, what did you end up doing?	I haven't been in this situation but if I were I would probably just delicately ask to swap it. It's just a ring at the end of the day and he shouldn't take it personally if you don't like it. You're the one who will have to wear it for the rest of your life!	I shut up and wore it because while I didn't love it, I also didn't hate it. The ring my husband picked for me wasn't offensively ugly, just really not my style. I stopped wearing the engagement ring some time after we got married and I now only wear the wedding band and told him the ring isn't really my personal style and I don't want to damage the rings (since they're not soldered together). Thankfully it wasn't a super expensive engagement ring or I probably would have said something much sooner. I still have it and plan on doing something with it in the future- having the stones reset into something else.
Do you rid yourself of the hair above your lip or just live with it? Why?	I don't "just live with it", I live my life and happen to have hair on my upper lip while doing it. No one cares. Reading all of the comments here made me really sad.	I wax it off when it starts getting long enough to notice in the mirror (as long as I notice it on a Friday so my skin has the whole weekend to recover before work on Monday morning. I don't like my stache so I get rid of it. Plus, I work in a high school and, even though I shouldn't be, I'm still very worried about students making fun of me for various other reasons. If I can do away with one small reason, I feel better. If I liked my stache more on my own, I wouldn't wax it just for my students, though.
If your wife/gf cheated on you with another woman, would it bother you the same as if she cheated on you with a man?	cheating is cheating. It annoys me to no end when bisexual women use the "it was with a woman so it's okay" defense to justify cheating. I know it's not fair to the millions of faithful bisexual women out there but it's happened enough time that I try to avoid dating bi woman	I believe the reason this phenomena exists is because if she cheats on you with another man, you can make a direct comparison between him and yourself and that leads to thoughts of inadequacy. Essentially, what's he got that I don't? With a woman though, you can't make that direct comparison. What's she got that you don't? Well tits and a vagina for one. The sex she has with your SO isn't the same as the sex you have with her, the things your SO finds attractive about her are likely not things she's looking for in you. Because it's apples and oranges, the tastiness of your apple isn't called into question.
How often do you have sex with your partner and how long have you two been together?	When I was 26 I’d be good to go anyplace, any time. I would have loved to have you around. I’ve never pushed someone’s hand away from my crotch in my life and hope never to. I hate to say this, but if he’s not getting it from you, are you positive he’s not getting it somewhere else? It may not just be a low sex drive thing.	I'm about your age. I could bang my girlfriend every single day, multiple times a day. One of my best friends told me he only cares about sex once a month. Your bf might just be like my friend, no real deeper reason than that.
How many of you had sex with a girl that you were very unattracted to?	I have. Tho not PIV sex... She was a lesbian who wanted to be fisted in all holes by a man and then cum on her face. I obliged. I also did the same to her gf who was really pretty.	Yes I have. I was recently separated from my wife who cheated on me. Self esteem really took a hit and I went for whatever I could get to make me feel better... it did not make me feel better.
What does taking yourself on a date look like for you?	I must be old. I have never heard of the term "taking yourself on a date". I'm not really sure what it means.	I go to tjmaxx or Marshalls and sniff all the candles. Then I go to trader Joe's and buy a small houseplant. I go home and order delivery. Then I get really high. I light one of my candles and then I figure out where to put my new house plant. Food arrives and I sit on the couch and watch really trashy reality TV. I talk out loud to the tv the entire time. Then after all that I go to my room where I watch porn and masturbate. I'm asleep by 10 and it's great.
Would you take male contraception? Why?	Nope, I don't like the idea of chemicals fucking with my sperm I doubt I would ever take it, but would certainly wait 10+ years to check for eventual side effects	Yes. She's stopped taking the pill because we had concerns about it affecting her mental health. I would absolutely take it once I'm happy about the extent of the side effects. Condoms suck.
When was that flip of the switch moment for you, when you realized how you're being treated isn't right, and you deserve better?	When I found out that I was worth something. By this I mean I had value in my life. I’m a Christian so God tells us we are valued by Him.	When I realized that my friends, family and coworkers would be ashamed and would pity me if they knew how I was living and what I was putting up with.
To those that went to an all-girls school, how do you think it affected you?	Honestly, the color scheme of the uniform affected me way more than the fact there were no boys. It did make my childhood harder than it should have been. I went to a school with boys from 15-18 and it was whatever. I'm gay and was never particularly interested in male approval, so YMMV if you care about that.	I taught a course at an all-girls high school a long time ago. Before I taught it, I was weakly opposed to single-sex education -- I couldn't see any benefit to arbitrary segregating people by gender. But teaching there was shocking -- the students at that school were completely unlike any others I'd ever taught. They were confident, engaged, and enthusiastic at an age when most of the kids I taught competed in the "I care less than you do" olympics. I have no explanation for why removing boys from the classroom would make act so differently, and if I hadn't seen it myself I wouldn't have believed it.
What is the best thing you've ever purchased from Amazon?	1) My Wedding Ring. :) Mexican Fire Opal. 2) Surprised no one has said lube, yet. Leave it to me to pop everyone's comfort bubble. 3) The bedhead watermelon shampoo I use when I give my dogs baths.	Fucking toilet paper. I'm not joking. The Safeway near my home sells a 24 pack of Charmin ultra strong for **$18**. These are 2 ply, regular size. Amazon sells a 48 pack of Charmin ultra strong, 2 ply large size for **$20**. I went from buying toilet paper every 2 months to every 4.5 months, for $2 extra. Free 2 day shipping with prime.
People with stupid names, how's life been treating you?	I once met a woman named La-a. Now let me ask you, how would you pronounce that name? Turns out it's pronounced Ladasha because and I quote "The dash ain't silent." Not sure how life is going for her now but I always found that to be the most unfortunate name I've ever heard. Edit: Why the downvotes?	A guy I work with is named Daniel Daniel Daniel. He takes it in stride since a lot of people ask if this is really his name. He gives ever changing Joker like answer about how he got the name. My favorite is his dad lost a poker game and had to name his kid the same name first, middle, and last.
What's the worst conversation you've ever had with a random man?	in the apartment complex where I live, that are several India men (they work near here) and one of their apartment has its porch turned to the backyard. my cats love to play there so I take them everyday and enjoy to take a walk. it's been a week I think that they (the Indian men) keep staring at me, like really watching while I walk. today I was tired of this bullshit I decided to talk with them, I'm thanks they did not disturbed me anymore. I hope they don't it tomorrow. it wasn't one of the worst "conversations" but I know, it feels like I don't have privacy, respect or safety inside my own home!! feels terrible to think that I can't walk my cats without being bothered by man with disgusting stares.	being hit on or cat called at the age of like 11-13 by grown men when I clearly looked like a little girl fucked me up
What was a silent "bro moment" you shared with a complete stranger?	I was masturbating at a supposedly empty public toilet (its a place where there are less people arpund) and then this handsome dude comes and tells me "I can suck it for you". I let him suck me and then we went our separate ways.	Was at Disney where I got a turkey leg to eat. Some guy who spoke zero English pointed at the food and pulled out a map. I showed him where and left. About an hour later my wife and I were stuck in a crowd. Looking around I see this same guy in the crowd. Dude lifts his turkey leg up with one hand and smiled. I returned the gesture. Food is a universal language
Black women of reddit, what has been your experience with criticism and judgement from the black community with dating outside of your race?	I am a black woman, and I do not like it when I see hot black men with ugly fat white women. On the other hand, hot black women usually go out with hot white men, so no inequality there	My best friend growing up was black of North African descent. When she dated a white guy, I remember this black male friend of hers flipping out and said black women should date only black men and black men can date anyone. This guy always spoke his mind without any worry of sounding hypocritical though.
How do you cope with being alone and unloved ?	It's very unlikely that you're unloved, unless you legitimately have zero friends. But if that's the case, the first thing you have to do is work on why "being alone" is a negative for you. Once you enjoy your own company, and are comfortable in it, everything else will come easily.	Usually, I don't care, but sometimes this feeling comes rushing and then I just mope a bit or in really bad cases, cry myself to sleep.
Have any of you encountered a PUA / Red Piller in the wild? How frequently do you come across them?	I have known a few guys who read TRP (well, not on reddit, but TRP type stuff). They weren't PUAs though. I didn't date them but I didn't find them awful. They had been majorly burned in the past and were trying to find their inner confidence. Trying to get a footing, rather. They were respectful to me, although who knows what they actually thought of me. It wasn't that bad. *shrugs* I liked talking to them about their experiences.	i was at a party in college and this guy kept telling me he had a magic trick that involved him stroking my hands for a really long time. i sat there for like 20 minutes waiting for the magic trick to happen and then he was like "now you're going to want to kiss me" or some shit and i was like...why? you just took 20 minutes of my time and there was NO FUCKING MAGIC TRICK. PUAs lie, guys.
Fathers of daughters: Did you warn your daughter's bf(or gf?) the first time you met them about anything?	If I have a daughter I'm just going to put on an act because it is fun as hell. Im like 6'3 and large so it'll be fun as shit to show off all my guns and how I would use them on someone who hurt my daughter. Then you have to invite them over when she isn't there with a cigar and a drink on the rocks and explain how it was fun to fuck with their head. It is like, American tradition. And if the dude gets scared and doesn't come back then oh well. I'm not that scary. Damn yall are all about feelings and shit. PCaskmen	Not a father, but I'm really hoping this is one of those dumb tropes that basically never exists in real life (like the sitcom dad who is an imbecile with a room temp IQ but somehow manages to own a home and support a family entirely on his one income). Your daughter will have her heart broken, have good relationships, make bad decisions, have rigorous sex, perform oral... You know, all the things a son would do. Its called experiencing life.
Men, what makes you feel sexy?	Women. Honestly I can feel good wearing nice clothes and stuff but women make me feel sexy. Can't nothing beat a woman want to put her hands on you.	There was this girl I used to see. We didn't really date per se, things didn't work out, but we were quite fond of each other for a small period of time. We were sitting on a couch and were holding hands, when suddently she jumps out of the couch giggling and going somewhere else. I took it as a weird epiphany of rejection, but later that day she sends me a text telling me "Sorry about that, but you made me wet and didn't want to embarass myself in front of everyone". Sweetest thing anyone ever said to me
Has your partner ever told you they found you less attractive after you LOST weight??	I have a friend who was 300+, dating a thin girl who liked bigger guys. He hit an emotional moment of severe depression and decided to start losing weight, during his insitutionalization after an attempt, she cheated on him, and then again as he was losing weight. He became very cynical about women in general and upset but fueled his desire. Many years later he is a crossfit instructor, 180ish and very fit with a new girl who seems to be perfect for him. People r shit.	Yes, he has. I'd lost far too much weight accidentally due to other factors in my life when I was very busy and skipped meals often in order to study and work. I thanked him for his concern and honesty and put on some weight. If you can't tell your SO how you feel about their body honestly, then the fuck kind of relationship is it?
Ladies, did you find your SO physically attractive the first time you saw them?	Only a little bit. He's just your typical tall, lanky guy, so nothing special. I only started dating him because I pitied him a bit...and yet, here I am, two years later, and we're planning to get engaged. The more I talked with him, the more attractive he became. To most of the world though, he's nothing special.	When I first saw him in person, yes. The pictures on his on his dating profile didn't do him justice, though, so before our first date I was kind of on the fence of whether I found him attractive or not.
What is your immediate perception of a woman that has no social media or online presence?	A) she's probably as close to a perfect woman as you can find or B) she is hiding social media from you B is usually more likely	My wife has no social media presence of any kind. She's also the most grounded, stable, and reliable woman I have ever met. Great mom to my kids, fantastic wife to me, killer work ethic, etc. She did have a facebook briefly, but my family are a bunch of dicks who post gross photos, so she deleted her account and told me that social media is my problem now.
Fiancée was amazing until I proposed. Im conflicted. What do I do?	If you are not the type of person who likes to play 'keeping up with the jones/jeffersons/whatever last name' you might want to rethink marrying this chick. I'm not going to say she is going to flip the switch as soon as she know you cant run without legal backlash but I am gonna say i suspect it. the best way to find out is just ask her. I'm not saying she is going to tell you the truth when you ask her but her reaction will tell you everything you need to know.	Everyone's saying dump her but that's dumb. She's stressed because she probably has her idea of a perfect wedding and what she wants is getting in the way of your relationship. I would suggest premarital counseling because the question you really want to ask is whether you're more important than the wedding and that's a delicate question that would benefit from a mutual third party.

How do you deal with a friend who is constantly coming to you about their toxic “situationship” but won’t leave them?	I become pretty distant and have no emotion when they bring up the same thing. Or in some cases I Left the friend. Once to three times is fine. I get it takes time to disconnect from a person But any more than that is just finding an excuse to complain and do nothing about it because at the end of the day they choose it Toxic venting is a thing and I won’t have it near me.	You have two options. 1. You tell them you can't handle it anymore and the conversation needs to stop and possibly go low/no contact. Or 2. You provide help and support where you can. You encourage them to be more independent, to be strong, to take care of themselves with the hope that when they're strong enough they will make a better decision.
What did you get for 25$ or less on Amazon that made your life easier or better?	Flushable wet wipes. My puckered rectum has never enjoyed the after effects of hot wing night more. The soothing comfort add a slightly cool, damp wipe clears capsaicin from my brown eye is amazing.	Any time this kind of thread comes up, I recommend the same thing: [this wash cloth](https://www.amazon.com/Salux-Nylon-Japanese-Beauty-Cloth/dp/B000CSDDDG/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1470327904&sr=8-3&keywords=salux+wash+cloth). I've never felt so clean as I do once I started using this thing.
What unrealistic expectations do young men have about dating?	That you have to ask her out, then go on the date, then bang. My most successful relationships were bang first, date second. We just met in class, work, friends of friends, and hit it off well enough to bang before formally dating.	That there's some special trick that will make any woman want to sleep with you. Whether it's doing her a ton of favors, negging/peacocking/whatever the PUAs are talking about these days, having a six pack, whatever.
Your thoughts on a guy asking his future fiancée's father's "permission" to marry?	It's misogynist as hell. If my partner even tried to pull that crap, I'd dump him on the spot. There is no reason to even speak to anyone other than the partner before proposing.	I know some people who insist on it because it's very meaningful for them, usually as a way to involve their fathers in the whole thing. Like, it's a big deal to their dads, so it's a big deal to them. In my case my husband talked to both my parents, and just said, "How would you feel if I asked her to marry me?" I liked that better. I do think it's nice to get some family input if the woman in question is close with her family - he's going to be joining the family, after all, so it impacts them too. It's not necessary or anything, but it's a nice gesture.
How aware are you of your own attractiveness?	It's fluctuating. Sometimes I'm aware, sometimes I really don't get why women find me attractive in a context where I really don't find myself attractive (bad picture, looking like shit after a rough night, etc.)	No idea. Eventually, I just gave up and concluded that when people said I wasn't unattractive, they lacked enough motive to be lying.
Anyone who found themselves completely friendless as an adult, how did you deal with this and/or overcome this?	Gonna get flak for this but I think it's way better to have more shallow friends than those 'best friends' cause there's so many expectations out of a best friend, also do they really care anyways? I'm sure some best friends would do literally anything and always be there no matter what, but that's 1 in a 1000.	I moved a lot as an adult, and I found that the best way to make friends (outside of work, obviously) is to look into clubs/groups for things that you're genuinely interested in. Imo it's much easier to get over the initial friendship awkwardness if you have a topic to discuss that you're both interested in. I started volunteering for an animal rescue and joined a gardening club. I also cook a lot for people, so they chat and entertain each other while I cook and interject as I wish. \*Obviously most of this is on hold due to COVID.
I'm turning 21 in thirty minutes and I'm stuck at the doctor's with strep throat. What did you guys do for your 21st birthday?	Went to a bar with like 100 friends, got blackout in 45 minutes, puked on a jeep and woke up in nothing but jeans face down on a hardwood floor. Good times. Edit: why the down vote?	I bought a sixpack of Sierra Nevada and drank one. I had work the next morning. That weekend, my roommate and two of my sergeants brought me to the casino and got wasted. I ended up being the sober one. My roommate barfed in my car. I won $210 at blackjack.
What's a dating norm that's recently come about that you don't like?	If your post is an attempt to rationalize and explain the behavior that the commentators in this thread mention in their responses - don't. That's not the point of this thread, no one asked for an explanation, it will be removed for derailing. If you read comments in this manner responding to top level responders, please report it.

What do you consider to be the most casual/subversive sexist thing you've experienced?	I am tiny. By tiny I mean 4'11" and 120 soaking wet. But I live and work on a ranch, so I lift 50 lbs fed bags all the damned time. I've gotten used to it and lifting things are easy. I get men, mostly, trying to step in and lift heavy things for me when I can do it myself. Dog food bag at the store? Hell of a lot lighter than the fed. Cat litter? Water bottles? No problem. I hate it when they say." get a man to do it." Asshole, do you wrestle with adolestant rams to make them move? Didn't think so. I can do it myself. The only time I will have people lift it for me is if it's too large for me in height and its Awkward. Or my back injury is acting up and it will hurt me.	When me and the SO were buying a new tv and on a separate occasion a laptop, I had a list of specs and things I wanted at minimum and things I didn't care for. The salesman kept speaking to my SO exclusively and trying to talk about the different products with him. Eventually I went off by myself to find what I wanted went back to the salesman for a quote and to negotiate a better price and he would keep looking at my SO and trying to convince him what I wanted was wrong so I took the quote and found a different store who priced matched it.
Women who are ambivalent about having children, what is the biggest reason why you wouldn't want them?	As a mom of two: If you’re not willing to “life” for and with another individual 24/7, don’t have kids. 🗣💋🦄🖤🤷🏻‍♀️ EDIT: “I don’t want them. I don’t have a reason.” Is 100% a perfectly good reason. Dont let ANYONE convince you into kids- you convince you.	The potential to wreck my body/health, having to put the child first over everything else and the lifestyle change. Comes across as selfish and probably is a little but it’s a huge responsibility that you’d have to be willing to give 100% to and I don’t think I’m at that stage or if I’ll ever be. I see people half-ass their parental duties and I couldn’t do that.
What is your favorite physical attribute?	The fact that such forces as gravity, inertia, and friction act upon me. Life would be rather difficult if they didn't.	My hair. It's naturally three toned. It's thick and silky and lustrous. It sucks in the summer, but no one ever said being fabulous is easy.
Which myth(s) do you wish would die already?	Gun control will keep people safer. Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. They also have one of the highest homicide rates in the country. Criminals do not pay attention to laws. They will get their hands on guns no matter what. Disarming law abiding citizens does not make everyone safer.	Defibrillators aren't magical life-restarting machines. They're quite literally almost *never* used correctly in TV and film. I know it's a great plot point, but I think it's giving a lot of people potentially dangerous ideas about what these things actually do. If a patient has flatlined, using a Defibrillator isn't going to do anything but mildly barbecue their corpse.
Ladies who chose the copper IUD: did your periods really get worse? How much worse?	No, but I did get a baby cousin as a side effect of the copper IUD that my aunt wore! 😆	After about 15 months my periods went from okay to awful. I became super bloated, like I couldn't button my pants, I was bleeding through a kotex super plus tampon in two hours or less. My cramps would make me nauseated and light headed. I had it removed after 18 months.
(Question) I'm contemplating getting a vasectomy. But I don't ever get laid. Is it worth it?	I say do it. If you've gotten to this point in your life and still don't want kids then you never will. And you don't want a little drunken mistake to happen either. With pills, if they come out, if you miss a day, then you're potentially fucked. A vasectomy is how you know you won't have kids. Get it.	>I've been reading that the male birth control pill is soon to be released to the public Hehe, I will gladly bet you $300 that "soon" does absolutely not mean within the next 5 years. $150 that it does not even mean within the next 10 years.
Men who browse askwomen, in what ways has your view of women changed?	[Aight folks, as our sidebar says....we don't do complaining posts about other subs here and this one's turned into quite the doozy.....so we're locking the thread.](https://shareitfitness.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/large-salt-pile1.jpg) Real talk: don't like a particular sub on Reddit?

What's your favorite picture of yourself?	Users are reminded that by sharing a picture with the community, they potentially lose all control over what happens to that picture and what other users do in response to that picture. In the past, we have had issues with: * Stalking/Harassment * A user writing a script to scrape the thread and attach pictures to user names at a later date * Doxxing * Unwelcome private messages Post at your own risk!

Girls can now join Boy Scouts. What do you think about that?	Honestly, it’s a good thing. Girl Scouts as an organization has been lacking for decades compared to the BSA, and the more people involved the better, especially with different perspectives like women. Although it shouldn’t change too much, I don’t want it to slip into Girl Scouts 2.0 or whatever.	I mean, there is a thing already. It's called Venture Scouts. It was treated in my troop as a post-Eagle thing, and it was co-ed.
What is the most unusual kink that someone you dated revealed to you?	Had a girlfriend constantly asking to peg me. I told her to fuck off and she wasn't happy so we ended that shit then and there.	My girlfriend had kind of an odd fixation on lactation for a while. Did all kinds of stuff like take herbal supplements and changed her diet to try to cause her to lactate without getting pregnant. Never worked and she eventually dropped it.
What glorious thing took you far too long to discover?	Girl fuck that gym up! ✨👏 I'm certain they'll help. I doubt they could handle a whole bladder but a lil pee would be easy as heck for them to handle. (Edit: Why downvoting??? I love seeing badass babes owning the gym!)	Refusing to engage with people who make me feel bad about myself or simply say things only to get a raise out of me and have pointless arguments with. The moment I realised I don't have to acknowledge these people or give in to their madness, my life became so much more enjoyable.
What is a conventional female practice, that as a woman, you don't like or agree with?	Remember, as we're getting our snowflake on, you can not like and not agree with something without running down those who do.	Remember, as we're getting our snowflake on, you can not like and not agree with something without running down those who do.
What's the littlest thing someone has said that's upset you, because it showed how little they actually know you?	When someone says X pair of shoes are too expensive. O-o Maybe for you but nor for me. Plus, I have soft-sensitive feet and invest in quality & comfortable footwear. I don't wear cheap shoes that will f'ck up my feet. Prefer to invest in high quality shoes than have dozens of low quality shoes that are crap. I know countless women in their 20's & 30's who have f'cked up feet for wearing cheap low quality shoes, with bunions, hammer toes, sores, etc., They have to have surgery while I have feet that are presentable and good to go! :))	"Where can you get the best crab cakes in town?" "Mom, I don't know. I'm allergic to shellfish." Every. Visit.
What is the worst decision you've ever made?	I would say it was rushing into a shitty marriage with my soon-to-be-ex-husband, but then I wouldn't have my daughter, so it's hard to say. So I'll go with taking on so much student loan debt.	"Smokers get more breaks from work, I'm going to smoke just this summer at work, until school starts." 15 years of addiction.
Sex lingo: what terms don't you know? What are you surprised that other people don't know? How did you learn these terms?	I feel like I learnt a couple of new ones doing a sly google during cards against humanity but I can’t recall now.	I lived with an ex-boyfriend and a his best friend for a while. One weekend, I was talking to the best friend, told him that boyfriend and I were going to the glory hole tomorrow, and invited him along. Confusion and hilarity ensued when we discovered that I had never heard of the sex act "glory hole" and he had never heard of the waterfall in rural Arkansas named "the glory hole". It's a real and awesome waterfall. You should look it up!
Why is doing repetitive grind in game for nothing more gratifying than doing repetitive thing in work where you actually earn money?	Because grinding in a game is something that you WANT, whereas the repetitive boring job over and over again is something that you NEED to do.	Games have shortened the loop to minutes or hours, not months and years like real life. The reward loop is much more immediate and predictable in a game.
What is something you've done with a past exGF that you wouldn't do with you're current/future GF?	Get serious before checking I'm even capable of it. ... Yeah well, mostly what shouldn't have happened with previous girlfriends wasn't really under my control.	Put up with abusive behavior. Fuck that. I love my current girlfriend and she's amazing to me, but the second she starts treating me abusively, I'm out. My ex was awful and it took years to leave. I'm stronger now and I know the signs of an unhealthy relationship. I refuse to let someone treat me poorly, hit me, or manipulate me emotionally.
My fiancé just ended our relationship. Of two years. What do I do now?	Get on tinder and fuck as many people as you can. This is the fastest way to get over a break-up. It does not matter the nature of the relationship you just left, or how long it was going on for, or how it ended. Fuck. Everything.	In short: Focus on yourself, your heath, your schooling, your self-improvement. The grief is real, but it will evaporate over time. Trust me. You are very, very young and, if I can say so, too young to be getting married. I know everyone has different views on this, but your brain isn't even fully formed. At 36, I am completely different human than I was at 21. You have a metric shit ton of growing to do. In time, you will likely look back on this as a blessing in disguise. Mourn, and then embrace your freedom.
What do you hear Women saying about Men that just makes your blood boil?	Bigoted, generalized statements (ugh men always do xxxxx) especially from self-professed feminists. It's not so much that I feel bad for men, more that the hypocrisy enrages me. I see it on AskWomen from time to time.	I have a co-worker who says things to the men in the office along the lines of: "I bet you're a good boy and help your wife clean at home". If a male co-worker called me a good girl, he would have to apologize or face consequences. The fact that she could get away with talking like that to a grown man is appalling.
What has been your most frustrating moment of an attempted invalidation of your hobbies/interests?	So, playing a game that you enjoy is perfectly fine, but... A) You should probably stop leading with it. People have their prejudices, but if they know a little more about you when they find out about the thing they have a prejudice about, they may give you a little credit. B) She could have been engaging in a little playful banter to see how you would react. In response to the insinuation that your hobby is a mark of an immature person, you went with childish petulance. Fail, dude. You might have turned that around with a little self-deprecating humor. Instead you confirmed the prejudice.	When people who watch tv all day complain that i play video games and say it's a waste of time.
Have you ever made a major “girlfriend vs. career” decision? How did it turn out?	Kind of disgusted by the amount of people in here saying "Always choose the job." Not every man is a cold-hearted, simple-minded robot.	I was strongly considering joining the Air Force to pursue a TACP career. I was training pretty hard and was just about to contact a recruiter. But military life isn't great for relationships so I ended up not going through with it. I don't regret it at all though.
What is something you never understood initially, but suddenly clicked later on?	Physical attraction. I thought a pretty face was it, and good hair and makeup was a done deal- nope! Body shape is important, and wearing clothes that accentuate it while independently exuding femininity has been a total game changer for me. ex: Bit of cleavage, feminine color> GOT t-shirt. I still like my Greyjoy tee, but it no longer comes up in the date wardrobe.	This is a horrible story, but in second grade i noticed this girl on the playground didn't have fingernails. I asked her why, and she said "my mom pulled them out, she said I didn't need them." Seven-year-old me was just like, "huh." When it finally clicked for me ten years later, I felt and continue to feel horrible for not realizing what a horribly abusive situation she must have been in.
Okay, Men - Yesterday I asked what you got your SO - now I want to know... What did YOU get??	A bunch of button downs from Express. A new stage microphone, a microphone shield (so I don't need to soundproof a room), a new jacket and some other odds and ends. All around, I'd give this Christmas a 7/10. 8/10 with rice.	My SO is still asleep and everything's still under the tree and I'm losing my mind even though I'm 31 years old
Do you have angry sex?	I’ve never had angry sex. Sometimes I think I’d like to but when I’ve brought it up to my partner he’s always said he had angry sex in past relationships (that weren’t healthy) and it’s not something he wants to do with me. I guess I’m special?	Nope. If I'm angry with him I usually don't want to be in the same room, let alone have sex.
What makes you unreasonably angry?	Those inconsiderate asshole cyclists that just "have to be cars" on 40 mile per hour roads when there is clearly perfectly usable sidewalk. Now I have to lane change to get around you... Also people that throw cigarette butts out their car windows. Seriously pollute your own worthless car not my fucking world.	When you argue with a person whose disagreement is based on not understanding the totality of the issue rather than having an honest disagreement. Of course, if you say 'you just don't understand' you're a jerk. And I wouldn't say that. But sometimes a person needs like several classes in the subject just to get to the point of arguing and I'm just not willing to explain the constitution to you, Gerald.
What is the most recent thing on (mainstream) Reddit that made you think "fuck this shit world and all who inhabit it"?	All of the hate that Hillary Clinton gets over in /r/politics. I personally support her candidacy for president, but don't hate Bernie Sanders. He's just not the guy I want to vote for. The sheer amount of *hate* that woman receives there, along with other online forums is absolutely astonishing to me. A lot of people who hate her can be super condescending to Hillary supporters, or undecideds as well. That's not to say there aren't Hillary supporters online who are just as rude, but I feel like the HRC hate is *strong* on here. I just don't understand why all those fervent Bernie supporters aren't channeling that hate over on the opposite party line. If your candidate does what he needs to do to get votes, he'll win the primaries and move to the general. You hating on and belittling HRC on Reddit isn't going to change that.	Seeing sexist comments in programming/technology subs is very personally discouraging to me. It doesn't make me mad, just makes me feel kinda down when I realize that I might run into attitudes like that once I get into the industry. Oh well, can't let that stop me.
What’s better than taking a tight ponytail out of your hair after an 8 hour shift?	**Status: Topic locked.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**	**Status: Topic locked.** Topics are generally locked when a post has received a large number of rule-breaking comments that require moderator attention. **Please report all rule-breaking.**
How is sex after childbirth?	It feels about the same to me. It still looks about the same I think, I would have to ask my boyfriend what he thinks. I think we waited about 10 days.	Pretty much the same. Did not notice visual differences. Orgasm at the same rate. We were told to wait six weeks, but waited four because we are both bad at following directions.
What is the biggest criticism or annoyance you have about someone but can't tell them either because it's not your business or because it'd be inappropriate?	If you want guys to stop thinking you're into them and trying to get in your pants, then I would highly suggest you s*top blatantly hitting on them and flirting like a fourteen year old!!!!* I'm a little tense.	I have a coworker who is sickeningly sexist both to men and women. It is damaging her career and she seems to think her deep understanding of the genders makes her stronger instead of disliked by many. I don't tell her cause she wouldn't listen anyway so what's the point.
Do you ever worry that a sex tape or nude photos will come back to haunt you?	If you worry about that, then a LPT is not make nude photos. There isn't even a point to taking them.	Yes. I just found out my ex sent pictures of me to at least one of our mutual friends. It's degrading and embarrassing. I never wanted the friend to see me like that. My ex won't even apologize :(
Is the latest crop of young female stars particularly baby-faced or am I just getting old?	I've thought the same thing about those two. I'm a dude and I just can't see Ariana Grande as a sex object.	I think it's a common theme with petite girls, I can never tell how fucking old they are most of the time. She could be 16 or 27 only the god of many faces knows.
All right now, how often do you wash not-every-time items?	I'll start. Towels once every week, sometimes two. Sheets about once a month. Pillows, I never wash mine but my husband's needs to be fluffed a couple times a week. I have never washed shoes unless they've been puked on. I wash my bras when they get especially dirty, usually every month or two. Almost never wash bathrobes, but we don't usually wear them much. Almost never wash other blankets unless there are visible stains. I live with my husband.	I am so foul that I don't even have a schedule. Just whenever I look at it and think, "Man, when's the last time this was WASHED?" And then I wash it. Towels and sheets get done the most out of your list. I never wash shoes. I need to be more on my bra washing game, it's kind of ridiculous.
What do men like about being straddled by a woman?	talk about trying to get into the head of someone, OPs follow up questions are intense to say the least	Love it. It shows a level of interest that I appreciate, and there's something very sexy about being pinned under her, too.
Ladies, what lies are your friends/acquaintances living on social media?	This one girl I went to school with is travelling at the moment and her posts are all "on the beach! love life! seeing the elephants in thailand!" and that feels sucky for all of 2 seconds until you realise she is sinking money into something she cannot afford on account of her job prospects being zero.	My MIL constantly reposts stuff about Parent Alienation. She lives in this magical world of denial that her ex-husband kept their sons from her when in reality she had done so much fucked up stuff to the family (she cheated, did drugs, kicked her own kids out forcing them to live models, etc) that her sons wanted nothing to do with her and chose not to see her for years.
What's the longest you've gone without showering?	About a week. Army. Sometimes because of an FTX. Sometimes because water is limited in Iraq. But I only went without showering because it wasn't possible. I still kept myself clean with baby wipes as best I could. Purposely going more than two days is just nasty and I'd never do it out of laziness. I'm no slob.	Three months. In the middle of summer. In Arizona. While only using maxi pads. I did go swimming often, but to say that I was a disgusting teenager would be the understatement of the year. I blame falling for the cult that is "juggalo family."
Men in your thirties who are living a "prolonged youth" – enjoying life, your hobbies and your relationships without kids or other extra responsibilities – what are the drawbacks to your lifestyle choice?	No drawbacks for me. I have tonnes of time and money. I have sex with a couple new chicks a week. I see all my married friends when I play hockey and they wanna see pics and vids of the chicks I bang. I went to my nieces 2 year birthday party recently and all the couples with children look literally EXHAUSTED. Some of the mothers look like they've been through the war. The expression on their face said "Shit, I didn't know I signed up for this life"	Um. Well some family members (not all) bug me about kids and "when yall gettin married?" Some friends have dropped off the map. But I've since met new friends too. So I don't really feel alone that way. Occasionally I get to visit a long time friend and catch up. Other long time friends have remained ever present in our social circle even with their kids. Some folks become home bodies and some don't. For the record I've never been the type of person who has to keep up with some life script, as you put it. What was your reasoning for asking?
How do you deal with having your heart broken?	Whisky, Weed and Women. It's not a great long-term plan but it works wonders for the first couple of days.	Same thing happened to me about a month ago. It's starting to get better, but I've got a long way to go. The only thing that's helped me so far is trying to keep myself busy. I know it's tough, but try not to think about her too much. It's really easy to slide back and relapse.
What are your favorite movies about women?	Girl with the dragon tattoo series, the newest Mad Max has a female co-star Are there really not many movies that feature women? Seems like an equal amount to me.	A League of Their Own, Little Women, Now and Then, Million Dollar Baby, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Help, Thelma and Louise, Girl Interrupted, Mean Girls, Clueless, Frozen
Men who are in their 30s, what advice will you give men in their 20s before they turn 30?	31 here. Alcohol is a waste of money. When I think about the number of cars, investment opportunities, and vacations I drank away it makes me want a drink. Alcohol is a drug. If you're serious about doing drugs then do them hard and get yourself out of the way of the rest of society. For the rest of us, don't drink. It serves no good purpose and it makes you grow titties. You don't need titties that bad.	Create a routine to stay in shape, you dont have to be on the cover of mens health but start a routine now, weight is harder to knock off when you get older. This will also help with confidence and your over all health. Tomorrow is never promised
Heya Gentlemen, what is the "manliest" movie to come out in the last 25 years?	The Grey. Liam Neeson in a hauntingly well acted role trying to get a few men through the wilderness alive.	First one that comes to mind is Gran Torino. Young punk's transition to adulthood guided by the dirty old man next door who is struggling to accept 21st century American life. But I'm sure there are other better examples.
Lesbian women of Reddit who once thought you might be straight/bi: what did you feel toward men you THOUGHT you were attracted to? Straight/bi/pan women of Reddit: what do you feel toward men you ARE attracted to?	I'm pan and poly. My primary partner and one of my secondary partners are male, and I have a female secondary partner. Primary: He's funny, suave, sophisticated, incredibly intelligent, an amazing lover, and kind. I like his short dark hair and beard the most, aesthetically. I love him. Want to bang him all the time. Male identifying Secondary: He's funny, goofy, nerdy, gamer. He's kind, understanding, sweet. I like his long hair and his eyes the most, aesthetically. I like him a lot. Definitely want to bang him a lot. Female identifying Secondary: She's shy, sweet, and beautiful. I don't know her too well yet but I definitely want to bang her.	I’m gay but tried to convince myself I could be bi when I was younger, like middle school aged. The only boy I’ve ever had a crush on was a friend of mine in 7th grade. I thought he was cute and wanted to hang out with him. My crush ended when my friends told me they wanted to hold hands and kiss their crushes and I realized I had no interest in that, turns out I just really wanted to be friends with this dude
[NSFW] Men, what made you shoot the biggest cum load you ever have?	I was 21, i was fucking the best friend of my little sister (16 yr old sexually ferocious black girl) - was banging away from missionary when she went from gripping my ass with both hands to inserting a finger up my ass - no one had ever done that before - under any circumstance - I came about 2-3 seconds later - i shot the never ending load in that girl. Just a river of jizz.	The last girl I was with, we spent the day in bed. She and I decided to actually test this and continuously get me right up to the point where I came and then back off. We'd fuck, stop and eat, maybe watch tv for a bit and cuddle, and fuck more, rinse and repeat. After about 7 hours of that on and off, she decided she wanted to see just how much I would cum. She was on top and when I came, it shot over both of us and hit the wall above my head about 4 feet over my head, and the rest absolutely coated her back.
Why is your ex-bestfriend your ex-bestfriend?	I joined the military, and he still sits around in his sister’s house smoking pot, working at Lowe’s, and dating a high schooler. I want nothing to do with that.	We just drifted, no bad blood but after a while we just stopped seeing and speaking to each other regularly.
What little quirk do you love about your SO?	His belly laugh is probably the cutest thing on the planet. His face gets all scrunchy and he tries to suppress it and keep talking and then he smiles all the way into his eyes and he laughs like when you shiver and your voice gets all stuttery. It's pretty difficult to get him to belly laugh, so eliciting this reaction is like witnessing an actual miracle.	His white boy dancing paired with the way he'll randomly sing something instead of speak it. "I can't mess up this paint joooob, don't fuck up don't fuck uuuup, aw yeah, didn't fuck uuuuup..." And then he does an absurd butt waggle to seal the deal. He's ridiculous and I adore it.
What is your "The one that got away" doing nowadays?	He didn't in the end. We both weren't ready for a relationship the first time around. We've been together 8.5 years and are expecting our first child.	He's single, has an amazing job and bought his dream car. He's living the life we planned, just without me. I sometimes wonder what life would be like if we stayed together.
My girlfriend believes the moon landing was fake. How do I explain to her it wasn’t?	You know those posts where the op posts about a friend/partner that has done something innocuous while asking for a ridiculous scorched earth solution? I this one of those times where it’s warranted.

Are any of you also really tired of friends constantly staring at their phones?	There is a whole generation coming up that will be even worse then the current one. Everyone is becoming a slave to the smartphone...	I usually don't take out my phone when I'm with others unless it's to answer a call or show them something. It is rude to be glued to a fuckin' screen when you're with some one. I've actually hung out with some female friends of mine and they barely said anything, just on the phone or wanting to take pictures of us together to tag or what ever and I get home after not talking and grinning and bearing a picture or two (I hate them) and I'm tagged in a status and tagged in what ever pictures they managed to snap... but we really didn't socialize. I hate it. Everyone is so concerned with convincing every one else they are having a great time and a great life and all that shit but in reality they're pissing it away making a highlight reel on their phones. It's dumb.
Who is actually looking forward to having a family and why?	Yes well it's that or the priesthood both is fathrrship but God knows. Father to maybe five kids or father to hundreds of parishioners.	Jot me down as +1 for family. Not anytime soon, but I'd love to have a wife and children with her one day. There's so many family discounts to places I can't take advantage of yet because none of my friends pass for young kids. Also the love that comes with belonging to a family would be cool too.
What's the worst thing you've overheard someone saying about you?	During college I was walking to class one day and a car goes by and I could hear a guy saying "she's ugly". They were probably checking my ass, since I was wearing tight leggings and I have a nice butt. Guess he didn't like the rest. I can honestly say it didn't bother me too much, by that point I'd made peace with my looks.	In highschool I was super shy somewhat depressed had few friends and was a general loner. I overheard someone say they thought I would shoot up the school one day.
What traits make a guy marriage material?	1) Has a solid support system consisting of both family and friends. 2) Has a good job. 3) Is seeking a strong woman with a career of her own. 4) Wants to build an empire of wealth **with me** not **for me**. That whole "I will show you the world" bullshit is really condescending. 5) Wants kids. 6) Likes weird stuff, and likes trying weird stuff. 7) Isn't a cookie-cutter personality. 8) Takes care of himself physically and mentally. 9) Is willing to subvert gender roles. 10) Open-minded. 11) Goofy.	Funny, sweet, nice to children and others, wants to do better for himself, wants a family, trustworthy, similar goals/aspirations, and loving each other is pretty important.
Men in LTRs or marriages, how has sex evolved in your relationship?	the first two years, put a penny in a jar every time you have sex after the first two years, every time you have sex take a penny out of the jar. The jar will never be empty	For us, the heat has increased tremendously over the years. The frequency has been pretty consistent at about 5 times a week. Most days we get busy. For us, it has gotten better and better. Comfort only grows. We laugh in bed. We try anything that comes to mind. We are really attracted to each other. We realize that sometimes only one of us might be in the mood. It is not hard to give it up for the one you love, and you usually end up in the mood along the way... We respect each other. All of that adds up to an amazing sex life that keeps getting better and better. We joke that it is not likely that anyone does it as well as we do and the jokes on them, cause it 's easy... Together 13 years, married 10 in September.
How has your personal relationship with religion changed as you have aged?	Bought up low level Christian. Church happened but only on occasion. The more I looked at the bible as I got older the more I saw it as a terrible book. I guess I just drifted away from it. I'm not religious but don't like the smugness of the athiests either.	My parents can't make me go anymore. Never really believed as a kid and it didn't do a thing for me and am an open atheist now.
Single dads: What's the most infuriating thing you've been told (that's related to your single dad status)?	You don't "get custody" when your spouse dies, you continue parenting. Whenever I hear of a father getting custody, I always assume the mother has a serious mental illness and/or addiction.	Took my 5 yr old daughter to the park after work and let her run around on the playground. Sat down on a bench to chill while she was playing with some other kids. About 10 mins later I was approached by an officer asking why I was there. They had received complaints of someone matching my description (tattoos and beard) stalking children at the playground. He was cool about it and figured I was there with my kids, but he had to ask. I wonder how many mom's have had the cops called on them for taking their kid to the park?
For Father's day, what's your relationship with your father like?	When I came out as trans to my parents it pretty much ruined whatever semblance of a relationship we had. My mom acts supportive but she has a problem with literally every tiny thing I do (those pants don't look good on you / You still like girls? So you're going to be a lesbian? / You're never going to look pretty so why are you going through all this?) My dad on the other hand seems to think the only reason anyone would transition is because they're gay and want to pretend they're straight so he rolls his eyes anytime I mention my girlfriend.	It's great. He's coming over tonight for dinner and gets to see our new, partially beshitted apartment. I got lucky having a supportive, caring, loving father.
Girl I've been seeing can't have sex(Medical Reasons), what would you do?	It's kind of crappy she didn't bring up the issue before you guys started fooling around and possible feelings got involved.	I mean... You gotta do what you gotta do. That level of intimacy *is* important. Do you want to feel like a dick now or drag it out until your resentment makes you explode?
Gentleman, what are your thoughts on how relatively little support there is for abused men compared to abused women?	As long as feminism keeps pushing for women are always the victim and keep dismissing false claims it will never change. i dont think the majority of men care enough to change it until they hit that "it happened to me" time.	On the radio a few weeks ago i heard an interview with a male survivor of domestic abuse. His story ended with his girlfriend having kicked him so hard his testicles ruptured. The entire story up until that point had me at waning interest and ambivalent thoughts. The fact that, at the end of telling the story, he was crying so much he was unable to get his breath. That hit me hard. I learnt alot from that interview.
Ladies who enjoy casual sex, what health care and safety measures do you take?	I use condoms for my less frequent partners. For my other very frequent partner, we don't. We're both clean and it would be a massive pain in the ass to use condoms because we stop and I suck his dick four or five times per session. I'm also on the pill and am super careful with taking it correctly.	Always, always use condoms. And I've had a tubal ligation for birth control. Trust your gut for safety about going home with someone. Don't drink too much.
Men- what's a few things you wish your SO would 'get' about you?	I want her to get the fact that I don't like arguing but we start because she takes my jokes too seriously. And that she needs to know that I don't like weed, it's not cute.	I don't feel the need to cram as many activities into my free time as possible and it annoys the shit out of me when you do and then guilt me into playing along. Just because we have a Saturday free doesn't mean we need to have activity after activity after activity planned so we spend the entire day touring the whole god damn state. I don't mind doing things, but I also want to have some time to just relax without having to schedule it between activities and adventures.
What lies are your friends/acquaintances living on social media right now?	That their shit is interesting to anybody. And I don't use social media anymore but that's the big lie of it all isn't it?	I know a couple of guys who, when I wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning, will have really, *really* long snapchat stories of them out in bars/clubs looking like they're enjoying themselves. I've seen them on nights out and literally all they did was sit round a table in a corner of the bar, with their phones out, taking snapchat after snapchat.
How difficult is having sex for the first time as a guy?	Easy, but awkward. It's usually followed immediately by your second time, though, which is *amazing*. Don't worry too much about it. Have fun! Play with her tits and her butt; it's a blast.	Help him put his penis in. This sounds stupid and funny but a lot of guys actually have troubling *finding* the actual hole of the vagina their first few times. You don't realize how much extra space and skin there is until you are trying to put your dick in and it is pitch black and you are nervous as hell.
Have you ever turned down sex from a person who was clearly throwing themselves at you? What happened?	Yes, more than once. I remember a slightly boozy girl I met at a movie theater lobby, friend of friends, and this woman at a gym who asked me to go upstairs w/ her etc. I dislike and suspect women who make themselves suddenly sexually available and don't find it an arousing scenario.	When I was in high school, this girl invited me to her house. She was alone, threw herself on her bed and said to take her now. I said no... She said gimmie three reasons why, if you can't, you have to. I said, "I don't have anything to protect us." She said it wasn't a good reason. I walked out. Next school year, she was pregnant. I was glad I walked away...
What is your number one protip for interactions with girls?	1. Stay dispassionate about them but passionate about the fun things that you do. 2. Stay mysterious. 3. Realize that you are an object to them - nothing more.	It's going to sound annoying and over used, because it is so often touted because it is the number one tip, listen. Seriously, listen. You'll learn more about what to say/do if you listen to a women closely and intently than if you just try and catch key phrases or just pay minimal attention. *Really* listen to what she has to say.
You are given unlimited funds to host the most fabulous garden party ever. What theme, food, drinks and desserts would you choose for this party?	I'd go with an Asian themed party. The garden would look like a Japanese garden. Guests would have the option of changing into traditional clothing upon arrival. The food, drinks, and music would be from across the entire asian continent, and specialists would be hired to make sure it all came together nicely. Traditional dances and folk tales would be told, and the night would end with a massive fireworks display.	I would have an elaborate hedge maze constructed. But what the invitees don't know is that the first to reach the center will be killed. The garden party is now a murder mystery party.
I'm so bored at work I just realized I spent half an hour reading the patent for stuffed crust pizza. What is some weird stuff boredom had led you to do?	I was once so bored with life that I bought a road vehicle that's borderline invisible, extortionate to insure, and offers no crash protection whatsoever. it changed commuting from a sequence of rote movements to an excitement-packed thrill ride. will that bmw pull out in front of me? I can't get out of that car's blind spot--I hope he knows I'm there. did that van forget to cancel their signal, or are they about to merge into me? I don't know, but I'm dying to find out!	A few weeks ago, I was super bored with life and decided to catalog all 480 some books I own into a spreadsheet. Now I can calculate the percentage of books I own that I've actually read. It's 41%
What's something you secretly judge women on?	I find short hair universally less attractive than long hair, so I judge a girl who gets really short hair although I don't have any animosity towards her or anything. If she wants to do it, do it. Also fat girls who hit on me. I can respect it if an ugly girl hits on me because she didn't choose to be ugly. But I'm in very good shape and fat girls don't have a chance.	When they're clearly deliberately playing down their own intelligence or opinions in order to seem cute or avoid conflict. It makes me feel like I'm having a conversation with a badly-written fictional character. I understand trying not to rock the conversational boat too much, but a clearly artificial personality, especially one that infantilises yourself, makes you seem desperate for approval.
What incorrect hygiene practice or belief annoys you the most?	I don’t understand people who think just splashing water on their vulva and labia is cleaning it. Sweat, discharge and blood (periods) need soap. I’m not saying shove a bar of soap up your vag but a little soap and water will not kill you.	A lot of the women in my family believe that showering/bathing/getting your body wet while on your period is a surefire way to ruin your uterus. ????????????
What podcasts do you listen to?	I listen to Pod Save America, Lovett or Leave It, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, StoryCorps, and Ask Me Another!	My Dad Wrote A Porno is hands-down the best thing to ever happen to me (sorry hubby). I have - legitimately - almost run off the road because of the tears streaming down my face as I'm laughing. Also My Favorite Murder.
How often do you initiate contact with your SO and come up with plans for the two of you?	From the beginning we never obsessed about who contacted whom and how much. We still don't. This was not the case with my other relationships. Best thing is when your mind didn't even go into the "am u trying too hard? Do I contact him too much? Will be run away if he thinks i am too interested??"	We live together, so contact doesn't really need to be initiated. Before we were living together, we sort of fell into a routine of spending weekends and Wednesday nights together. I don't remember quibbling over who initiated contact.
What is your opinion of having sex on the first date when looking for a relationship?	Honestly, if she sleeps with me on the first date I'm going to assume she's easy and sleeps with a lot of other men. I like when a girl is willing to holdback and let the tension build up a little. I think it makes the sex better once it finally does happen.	To me, it just means we're really into each other. What makes them girlfriend material is what we do afterwards. I've never got the whole "losing respect" thing. Sex is fun and natural. Unless they're huge degenerates, I couldn't see it as a bad thing.
Ladies, do you have short or long hair and why?	I have long hair because I got tired of my short hair. Short hair is higher maintenance for me. Also long hair is warmer in the winter.	Long because it's low maintenance. My hair is curly and awful and when I have it short, I have to put time into actually styling it to not look ridiculous. When it's long I can just tie it back and I'm done.
Are there any 25+ ladies who have never dated?	I'm demiromantic so I rarely feel romantic attraction. I need to become close friends with someone to feel anything, and even then, I've had three crushes. Two asked me out. For reasons I don't want to go into, I told both, "No." Things were complicated, and they're in the past. It hasn't felt like it's impacted my life much. I miss the feeling of a crush, but beyond that? You can't miss what you haven't experienced. Dating people I don't know to try and find someone doesn't interest me, and tbh, if I tried that, it'd be less Tinder and more Friender. I've had some marvelous friendships though.	I've never really "dated". I had a "relationship" in high school, but that was basically holding hands and then we never talked again. I'm basically a human ball of anxiety and self-loathing. Not exactly great relationship material. I don't know that it's really affected my life at all. I just kind of do my thing.
Women who love themselves and have high confidence, how do you do it ?	I used to hate myself and have very low self-esteem, but I have just realized that... well I am conventionally attractive, I am smart, I am successful for my age and on track to be more so, I am loved by the people who matter to me... How could I not feel good about myself when I realize there is nothing to feel bad about? Sure I still have my small hang-ups like wanting a flatter belly or whatever, but I know that it doesn't affect my ability to love and be loved...so eh?	I like to think of myself as my best friend. I'm the only one who will always be there for me. I would never say a negative thing to my friend and therefore won't say a negative thing to myself. Sometimes you have your down days, but as a few others have said, you actively say "no" to those comments.
TW: To those who've been sexually assaulted/raped, when did you feel okay again?	The next day. I'm not going to lie, it pissed me off in the moment but when it was over it was over. I have never been able to wrap my head around allowing something like that to cause so much trauma. It's a moment in time and when it is over it's gone. Why let what amounts to a few moments in time ruin any more of your life?	I’d say a year later I could mostly function in day to day life (medicated and in therapy). Got gradually better and better with healthy lifestyle changes. I got into a good relationship which has been healing for me. Now at 6ish years later only certain things (images, smells) trigger me.
Men who have a smaller than average penis, what's the proper reaction from someone you're hooking up with?	How is “smaller than my pinky” possible? I feel bad for dude. But since he’s an asshole. He deserves to have a babydick. Honestly the best reaction to a baby dick. I don’t even know. If he never told you about it in advance then good luck I think?	I mean... OP, there's smaller than average and then there's smaller than your pinky finger. That's micropenis territory. The chance of it happening again is pretty small (heh), but definitely acting like nothing's wrong isn't the way to go. The guy isn't stupid, he knows what he's packing. If it's *too small*, be honest. Let him know it's not working, so he can find other ways to please you. Toys, his hands, his mouth, etc. Also, check with him to see what's the best way *you* can make him feel good. Communication is the singular, most important thing in any sort of relationship. If you're comfortable sucking his dick, you should be comfortable discussing it.
I am not afraid of asking that girl out. I am afraid of having to put in the effort to develop a relationship with her. Does anybody else share this sentiment?	ITT: "I hate putting effort into something that has a low success/high return probability and feeling like I have to actually *prove myself worthy*. Why won't chicks come to meeee???"	Yes completely, Im not afraid of asking a girl out, I dont want to be some girls court jester: entertaining her, keeping conversation going, organizing everything, etc. I hate the feeling of constantly having to "prove" myself, its exhausting.
Men of reddit, with report after report of diamonds being worthless. What do you think men will be proposing with other than diamond engagement rings?	Strictly speaking, gold and silver are near-worthless, too, except for perception. You will find that most great things in life require a buy-in of one sort or another. If you want a long-term, committed relationship with an extraordinary woman, this is your buy-in. Let's be completely honest; in most cases she is getting the shorter end of the stick when it's all said and done, anyway. No pun intended...	There are a lot cooler gems colourwise I think getting one that is her favourite colour is a good idea
How do I, as a dad, help my daughters grow into happy, healthy sexual beings?	I guess you could let her know that that kind of behavior isn't appropriate for being in public. As for the "wait until you're married" advice that you seem expected to give, just refuse to give that advice. And if your wife decides to, tell your daughters when she isn't around that that advice isn't the only way to live.	When kids do that in social situations, as a teacher I say, "Ok _____, time to sit properly," or whatever. People can't masturbate in public.
What universally beloved thing do you hate?	Network TV Lil Wayne Basketball and Soccer (I understand they take talent to play but I simply don't care for either sport. More of a Baseball and Hockey guy). Bernie Sanders Weed- For the record I am 100% for the legalization. I have nothing against smoking it, I simply don't want too. How I Met Your Mother	I have nothing against Beyonce as a person or artist. Even though her music's not really my cup of tea, I can admit she's a great singer, performer, and dancer. Her FANS, however, are totally ridiculous. It's a cult.
To piggyback off of the "what's the rudest thing a guy has said to you?" Post... What's the NICEST thing a guy has said to you?	Maybe a bit superficial (but I'm also a perfume/good smell addict), but he looked at me with huge cartoon-heart eyes and said, "You smell like coconut...and...*heaven*!"	My husband and I broke up once while we were dating. Just for a couple of months. Once we got back together I noticed he had all these lotions from the a hotel laying around (he travels a lot for work). Him not being a lotion kind of guy I asked him. He said they smelled like me. So he brought them home.
Inspired by shoes-in-the-house thread: What's a norm that you didn't realize was specific to your culture until someone brought it up?	Bringing a small gift when you first visit, guest right, kissing on the cheek as a hello, offering coffee to anyone who comes in (even the mailman), not talking to strangers, smiling is reserved for friends... A lot of things How Americans treat everyone else as crazy in this thread is fucking annoying. If you're the only people in the world to harass strangers on the street, maybe you are the crazy ones?	Until I grew up and left my mother's house and joined the Navy, I was unaware most people ate so much store bought food. We had a ranch and many animals ranging from 50 some odd head of cattle, 15 pigs, 30 or 40 turkeys, and 50 or so chickens. We regularly traded meat for vegetables from various neighbors and visited the grocery store for special things like bread and pizza and peanut butter. I mean, we had 200 or so acres, what else were we supposed to do with it other than raise animals? Everyone has some chunk of land, too, right? Probably between 50 and 150 acres? No? Just us and our little area?
What do you wish you had discussed with your SO before you dated them or married them?	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders to your partners. Responses are welcome from all relationships regardless of genders.	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders to your partners. Responses are welcome from all relationships regardless of genders.
What are your thoughts on slut shaming?	Slut shaming is just another way to be mad at men who don't want you in my opinion. When I was dating I made it known right away that I don't date whores. There's varying levels of what's normal in terms of promiscuity. A woman in her 30's who's had 20 partners is understandable where as a woman who just turned 21 having 20 partners is a slut. I don't think slug shaming really exists outside of someone Already having a vendetta against a specific woman.	Some people are downright hateful towards women who are promiscuous, or even just women who are perceived to be promiscuous, and I think it's fair to be critical of that. At the same time, it's pretty common to get accused of slut-shaming just for having a preference against dating promiscuous women, even if you don't express any particular hatred for them or shame them. I think this overuse of the word is wrong and it doesn't get talked about as much as it should on the discussions of slut-shaming.
What's something that others often freak out about but you don't think is a big deal?	Periods. Women have them, and I don't understand why so many women make such a big deal out of trying to hide it.	Doing pretty much anything by myself. I am happily married but if my husband is busy or doesn't want to go, I have no problem going to dinner or a movie or anything really by myself.
What's a common belief about dating/relationships that make you think "well I must have missed the memo, because my experience is totally different"?	The belief that it's important to have sex early on in order to ensure that you're "sexually compatible." Sexual compatibility is real, but its importance is vastly overstated--at least on reddit. If a man and woman love each other and want to make each other happy, they'll usually be sexually compatible. We're not sexual jigsaw puzzle pieces that can only fit into rare shapes.	3-5 day rule for texting/calling. If I like her, she's getting a text from the taxi before I'm even home, and if she likes me, she'll be glad to hear from me.
What are the Pros and cons of having and not having an SO?	I've been thinking about this a lot recently (mum asked why I'm STILL single, and I asked her why should I not), and I'm struggling to think of a reason other than sex for the pros. Emotional support is something that you can get from friends and family, and I'm a bit of a solitary person, so loneliness isn't something I feel, but again, you have friends and family. Like, it almost feels like it's more for the woman's benefit, but, again, I don't see how. I think it's more whether you want people to think you're happy, and you have your shit together. I'm probably wrong, just my opinion.	Pro: i can do most things without needing to schedule or anything. I also havent shaved my balls in a long time. And my bedroom is a mess and i dont have to worry about anybody judging me for it. Con: im lonely and sad and in desperate need of hugs and kisses and cuddling.
How does a guy dance at a club and not look silly?	No one cares what you look like really. Only people who look bad are the ones who aren't having a good time. It's more about energy than moves anyways. If you look like your having a good time and putting out good vibes, that will attract people. You're overthinking it. It's a minority of people who can dance well.	For fucks sake, the number of Zen Masters in here telling OP to not care about society and be a perfectly confident self-actualizing being... He's not here asking for saccharine philosophical life advice. He's asking how to look better dancing in social situations. If you don't have advice specifically addressing this, then don't post!
What do you think of "trophy wives/girlfriends" and guys who date them? Do you have any experiences with them?	I think it's a little exploitative of those women to prey on guys who, for one reason or another, can't form any actual meaningful, quality relationships with women, and have to settle for one where they know that their partner's only really interested in them for their money.	I know of at least one succesful couple like that. My buddy owns a pretty big IT buisness, but is not only almost supernaturally ugly and goofy looking (at his best he looks like a crossover of Jack Black and Danny deVito), and really awkward around women. 3 years ago, he married a stereotypical "Russian bride", a girl she pretty much literally hired to be his trophy wife. And despite (or maybe because) the the cynical and matter-of-fact nature of their relationship, they are both very happy with each other. AFAIK, they are essentially housemates who sometimes fuck, but otherwise live their own separate lives, with friends, and even lovers (escorts for him) on the side. They are deifnitely not in love with one another, but are very good buddies, and their extensive and over-lawyered prenup guarantees that their financial relationship will be always steady and smooth.
What is a stereotypical personality trait in your society that gives both good and bad results?	Country with the world's most beautiful women (Colombia) Positive: sure, I can see it. The mix of different races and ethnicities makes for more interesting facial features Negative: people think women are "only" beautiful, and in certain circles expressing intelligent thought is met with surprise and shock	People in Turkey live their emotions at extremes. This causes people to be incredibly generous and helpful, including to complete strangers and tourists. But this also causes overreacting a lot of times. Basically whatever you give, positive or negative, you get it x3 back and people can go from very angry to love you like a sibling in like 20 seconds.
Men, what was something a woman said to you innocently that actually hurt you instead?	I was dressed down a bit more than normal since I was due to run some laundry, and a (non penile-equipped) friend of mine said something to the effect of "If you dressed better you would be really attractive" I made her *suffer* for like a week. I still don't know what prompted her to say something like that.	“You were my second hardest heart break” . She broke up with me actually. But why you gotta put a number on it?
Would you be embarrassed if your gf or wife masterbated after sex?	No, why would you? Some women need more stimulation, or if you can make it a point to make sure she gets off at least once before you do them maybe she won't have to Masturbate after sex as often.	Sometimes my husband will finish first and that's fine. We will lay together and he will kiss my neck or breasts while I finish. It's still a very intimate time for us.
Do any of you guys ever go through a nihilistic slump where nothing matters and there no reason to anything?	Not really.....I mean when I was younger, sort of. I hated the idea of going to law school or doing some mundane office job. So now I'm going to become a Police/SWAT officer and I can't stop smiling. So exciting.	I'm currently feeling that way. I continue on as normal, because there's no point in not living just because you won't be concious to reflect on your life.
What does your SO say to you that has you melting?	usually a few "youre dying a slow death, i poison your lunch and dinner every day" "you annoy me" and lastly "you are it, and that's it" edit - realize this is ask women and im a man, but im leaving my.answers	He really likes alone time and I come from a big family and never need time alone. He’s really good at telling me if he wants to play video games or something and we work well together. But I recently went on vacation and we both figured he would enjoy a full week of playing video games and watching tv he wanted to watch and me not monopolizing his time (#bachelorlife). First day I get a text that says “It’s pretty lonely without you here”.
Non American women of this sub. What is something you don't understand about the American women if this sub?	Please stop reporting this post, as it doesn't break any rules. However, remember that we do have rules against being disrespectful to each other. Thank you.	Please stop reporting this post, as it doesn't break any rules. However, remember that we do have rules against being disrespectful to each other. Thank you.
What is the most presumptuous thing someone has done, or said to you?	I remember in school my peers asking if a local vicar that came in to do assemblies was my dad. He wasn't and we looked nothing alike. A few years later they asked if the sexual health nurse was my mum. Again, no resemblance or relation. They often wouldn't believe me when I'd tell them who my sister was. After some insistence on my part, they'd then assume we were only half siblings. Nope, fully related. I think a lot of the confusion stemmed from the fact my sister and I ignored eachother at school because I was being bullied at the time and she didn't want to end up having to deal with that too. Can't say I blame her, it wasn't much fun.	At an informal dinner w/vendors this guy started speaking to me in Spanish. When i told him No habla, he starts lecturing me that I should be ashamed for not knowing the language and denying my Puerto Rican heritage. I'm black and my last name is Irish in origin, so...yeah.
Does anyone else just wear pack underwear everyday?	No because I only wear thongs and the VS XS are the only ones that fit my tiny butt :(	Yep. All I use is the Fruit of the Loom/Hanes packs ones. They're comfy and inexpensive and last a good long time!
Fathers of girls, has having a girl changed how you view of females, or given you a different understanding of women?	I don't have girls, but a friend put it this way. If you have a boy, you have a penis to worry about. If you have a girl, you have all the penises to worry about. Edit: For all you folks downvoting, I don't 'agree' with the quote, they're not MY words, just the kind of thing we hear from people within the context of the OP's sentiment. I was trying to add to the conversation, by kind of shining a light on the way a lot of people think about this.	I've got 3 daughters, and honestly they're all so radically different. It's like raising 3 different species. One's a lesbian tomboy, one is a frantic, emotionally delicate 13 year old, and raising her is basically like raising Murph from Interstellar. One is a little fireball who loves to cuddle, and is fun to troll There are general differences between men and women, and you can recognize some patters, but for the most part each woman is her own person. If you know something about the general patterns that you see with women, then that's going to help you understand a woman, but that's not even half the battle. Most of the battle is understanding her as her own person.
How do I call off this date?	"Hey, I actually don't think it'll workout so I'm cancelling our date" "Hey, I'm afraid that I've decided to cancel our date, I'm just not feeling it any more" "Oi, no date, ain't interested' (if you wanna be a cunt) Not that difficult, imo. Be direct about it, if she isn't interested she'll only feel relieved. If she is interested then she fucked up -- her feelings might be hurt, but that's the risk of this whole dating thing.	In my opinion, you should wait it out. If she said she wants to go on another date with you, take her at her word for it rather than overreact to a single days interactions. Confirm the date and plan it if you really like her. That being said, if she goes cold and doesn’t respond, move on and relish that you were right.
What have been your reasons for ghosting someone?	Most of the times I've "ghosted" people are when we've been talking for a while and been on one or two dates where I was always the one to initiate everything, and I decide "I can't tell if they're actually into me and I don't want to be pushy, I'll tell them to text me to set things up after our next date and if they're into me, they'll contact me." Then they don't text. I'm fine with things ending that way. I don't want to date someone who's too busy to make time for me or doesn't want to put in any effort. The only times I've refused to respond to someone's texts/calls are when they're being scary and won't accept my previous rejection.	Usually it's that they're pressuring me and/or otherwise making me uncomfortable in a way that makes me think they won't react well to being outright rejected.
Fathers who originally were indifferent to having children (or straight out didn't want any), how do you now feel about being a father?	I do not have children but your post remembers me of something I witnessed: A woman at the very end of her 30 complained that her husband is still not into the idea to get children. She said that he already said that he does not want any 10+ years ago but she can't understand why he still does not want any because she was so sure that he is going to change his mind. All her female colleagues joined in blame him for that.	I wanted no kids and the wife wanted 3, so we "compromised" and had 1. I love my daughter; she's awesome. I'm told I'm pretty great dad, but I still feel like I've made plenty of mistakes and will, very likely, make many more. Having my own hasn't made my like kids any more. If anything, seeing how polite my own is has made me even more cynical when it comes to the common child. They're all just... rude and selfish.
Might be a stupid question: what should I do if a stranger randomly molests a girl I'm with on the street?	You should have punched him in the face and pretended like she was your girlfriend or sister. Worse case scenario you get beat up.	Way I see it, you got three options: 1 Do what you did. 2 Do as others have said and call out the assaulter. Expect violence. 3 Go with crazy option. Yell out loudly "DUDE WHY DID YOU JUST GRAB MY DICK". Continue loudly asserting that this man did indeed grab your junk. I would be prepared for two things: violence and your lady friend calling 911. But I'd go #3. People don't want to fuck w/crazy. edit: counting is good
Do you ever feel uncomfortable hearing some men talking about sex in a predatory way? What drives this behavior?	In all reality this is done by both sexes. Some times your personal ideas don't match with others, that is part of the beauty of life.	I used to bartend and I had co-workers tell me that customers had said these sorts of things about me on multiple occasions. It made me feel like absolute crap. That these people I'd been nothing but friendly were talking all this disgusting, disrespectful stuff about me behind my back like I had zero sexual agency. Made me want to shower for an hour and then wear a burlap sack for the rest of time. I think it shows a huge lack of empathy and inability to relate to women as people. I've never heard anyone I respect talk about women this way. I assume they don't think of women as equals.
Would you side with the Jedi and the light side of the force, or the Sith and the dark side and why?	I have no idea, as I am a 43 year old man who has never seen a Star Wars movie. Yes, really.	I personally find both too constrictive and unnecessarily blind to other aspects of the force. I'd definitely be a Gray Jedi if possible. There is no Dark Side, nor a Light Side There is Only the Force
Where do you fall on the scale of [Ugly &lt;---&gt; Beautiful], and how do you know?	I'm a ten. I know this because everyone is a ten. Beauty is completely subjective. One person's "2" is always going to be someone else's "7". i know for a fact that I'm a ten for some people out there, so that's the number I go with.	Somewhere deep down I know I'm well above average looks-wise. I know this because of the way society has treated me since puberty. But when I look in the mirror I see Quasimodo.
How do I talk to my son?	How about you actually read books about it. Or, simpler, when you were a kid, what do you wish you got from your daddeeh? Either way, no kid wants to talk about school, they hate it	Take him on activites. I never had a dad, he was around but it was just awkward, I didn't see him that much. Honestly, just be around, just be there, play some ball. But don't force anything, just try to hang around, eventually he'll get comfortable around you. It's your son for god's sake.
What supposed ‘beauty hack’ have you tried that actually did more harm than good?	My mom always told me that “Beauty is pain” and once I found out that I needed to hurt my body to be “beautiful” to other people’s standards, I rejected societal forms of beauty	Using baby oil instead of shave cream. I almost died trying to step out of the bathtub when I was done. I will never do Pinterest beauty hacks again.
what's something that has made your life significantly easier ever since you started doing it?	Washing my clothes. I read a comment on Reddit that in order to improve your social skills you should first take care of your appearance. I don't own a washing masheen and I'm sort of a clothes hoarder but I'm very OCD about which clothes go together so it's very hard to get dressed in the morning that I just ended up wearing the same outfit as 2, 3 and 4 days ago. I washed one of my outfits in soap and warm water in the bath tub and people actually sat next to me on the subway the next morning!	I started doing Yoga a few months ago and life is easier. I feel stronger, have better posture, carry myself better. I used to always have to have the TV on because I wasn't comfortable sitting with my own thoughts for an extended period of time. Now I love silent moments with myself and I think I'm a lot mentally healthier because of it. Sometimes I drive with no music on so I can be with my thoughts. &#x200B; Also the "two minute rule" is a good one. If it takes less than two minutes, DO IT NOW don't think "I'll do it later." Wash that dish, put that thing back in the drawer, pay that bill. Stop leaving everything to "soak" cause that shit piles up and becomes un-doable once it's a pile of dishes, metaphorically and literally speaking.
What have your past relationships taught you?	+ gender roles suck ass + someone who needs an "admirer" to deal with feeling inadequate/undesirable/whatever needs someone who's not me	If someone cheats or quickly breaks up with their SO for you, they'll do it to you just as quickly. Some people are too lazy to put any effort into being functional. Drop them. Don't chase them. If they're interested, they'll reciprocate. Not reciprocating? They're not interested. Move on. When things are right, they will be awesome. When they're not, trust what you know and look at the situation objectively. It will hurt, but just cut it off when you realize it. Don't wait. It only makes it worse.
How do I stop wasting your time when you haven't explicitly asked me out?	To directly answer your question: fast, without any room for misunderstandings, cruel if need be. I can always have a comeback, among the lines: well aren't we having a great opinion about ourself! to save face. You apologise and blame it all on a misunderstanding, and we're all good. side note: why not date him? even ask him out yourself, you already have some common ground.This maybe because I have a penis, but that's my go to reaction when I know someone is interested.	"Oh, you're so cool! I think I have the perfect girl for you." If you really do, bonus. If you don't, he'll get the hint.
When you met a not cute girl, what did she say that made her cute in your eyes?	OP did you just post this question because someone posted a questing asking the converse of what you're asking just several hours earlier? I.e what made a girl 'ugly' instead of 'cute' to someone?	She kept the conversation interesting, we had common interests and she likes singing. Just 2 days ago, I went on a date with a better looking girl but it was nowhere as fun as talking to the less attractive girl. When I got back home we started texting again, and 5 minutes later she was the cutest person alive. She literally seduced me with her personality.
Men who have worked in fields dominated by women, how has your experience been?	currently working in a nursing home, 98% women employees. I'm in Administration, and I pretty much hate the work environment. A lot of cattiness, a lot of high school BS, a lot of rumors, and talking behind backs that eventually gets to me and I have to deal with. It's frankly not as glamorous as some people think.	Currently work for a University. My office is 7 middle aged women and myself. I'm about the age of their children so I get pretty much mothered. Constantly get advice on being the perfect husband and sometimes set up with their daughters friends etc.
What's a life lesson you learned that only experience can teach?	Women are capable of affectionate love (for their children), erotic love (sexual fulfilment), and self love (narcism... instagram, etc). However Women are incapable of selfless love. Women love men for what they do, or what their status provides. Women want security. If a man provides that then she will respect him/but she will never "freely/unconditionally love" him. Edit: Lots of down votes on this. Honestly this only applies to heterosexual men. It is a life lesson you can learn only through that experience.	When your gut is telling you that someone is not genuine or honest, and the red flags are there, trust it and move on.
What are things that men do that show they are insecure in their masculinity in your mind?	Thanks to everyone who participated within the rules. This topic has been locked due to brigading and other rule-breaking content.	Thanks to everyone who participated within the rules. This topic has been locked due to brigading and other rule-breaking content.
Ladies, what do you dislike about your SO but put up with it anyway?	I wouldn't put up with that. Who gets angry about being asked to help out the one you love with something so banal like carrying heavy shit. My former SO used to drink a lot on the weekends. Almost every weekend actually. I put up with his drunk/hungover ass for a year before I got fed up with it and asked him to tone it down. He couldn't (or didnt really want to, who knows) so I ended things.	He can't watch TV or movies without falling asleep. He could be wide awake but it's really, really rare that he can get through a 40 minute episode. 10 minutes in, he's snoring. And then he will ask if we can rewatch an episode because he fell asleep and he wants to know what happened, but then he falls asleep AGAIN. I really hate it when he says "Want to go watch netflix?" Because it translates to "Want to watch me fall asleep and call it spending time together?" Ugh.
Have any of you ladies ever gotten an STD? What happened?	I have herpes. I got it from a one night stand. We didn't use a condom because I was heavily intoxicated and dumb. I've only had one outbreak and I've been tested for everything else and I'm clean. Maybe the reason I am okay about it is because I know it could have been much worse. I could have gotten HIV. Herpes isn't bad at all. I've had the one outbreak and never another. I disclosed to all my other partners and they did not give a shit. Granted, I got it in Germany and in Europe herpes is a lot less stigmatized. No one really cares. My current bf got it from me despite us being cautious and I felt bad but he doesn't seem to care. He'd rather not use condoms and risk herpes than use condoms. *shrugs*	Yes I was young and naive. Chlamydia twice from the same guy. First time I took the pills and got some for him as well. Second time I did not get any pills for him, I told him, and then I left him.
Men who started receiving female attention later on in life, how did it feel and how did you deal with your new “popularity” among girls?	I still don’t know how to handle it. It’s so overwhelming to be able to fuck a new girl every week. Fucked 420 hoes in the last 69 weeks, feels good bruh	Honestly at first I thought it was some sort of an elaborate conspiracy hoax among the women in our town to trick me somehow. Then I realized that there's no way all these people know each other and why would they scheme only against me. Took a while to get used to it lol.
What kind of posts/comments remind you that Reddit is mainly composed of Americans?	Whenever someone asks a "who is your favourite comedian/actor/musician/celebrity?" The answers a almost all Americans (particularly with comedians, it's crazy to me)	Whenever people ask "Where do you buy your jeans/make-up/undies etc." I'm 90% sure my answer won't be relevant since a lot of places I shop aren't in the U.S. (For example I buy my undies at M&S, my jeans at Next, and my fave eyeliner is from Barry M.)
Women, what is the most awkward situation you've experienced when a guy asked you out?	I've learned to shake off awkwardness, but once when I was 15, I was at the mall with my mom. I left her to buy a slushie and the guy working the counter was probably 16 or 17. When I tried to give him money, he said, "Don't worry about it, it's on me." I, confused and oblivious, kept trying to hand him money. He just kind of giggled at me, I must have looked so lost, and eventually I ran away. GO ME!	I was working at subway. And this guy and his friend came in for about 3 weeks straight. I honestly thought they were gay. Then one day, the friend decided to ask me out for the other guy, while the other guy waited in the car "My friend really likes you, and is too afraid to ask you out, you're the only reason we've been eating subway so much" I was about 22 at the time. He was 26. Acting like a 10 year old. I went on the date, because I felt bad and thought eh why not. Turns out we had NOTHING in common and at the end he casually asked when he could take me to dinner next. To which I replied.. "uh....idk" and walked away. I felt awful. I was so awkward. Over it.
What aspects of life from a man's perspective are women most unaware/oblivious to?	How hard we've had to work for literally everything we are and have. Nothing is thrown our way just because we're cute. And as soon as we step out of line, both men and women will swarm to take it all away from us. I'd go so far as 'unaware' doesn't really cut it. It's utterly and completely 'oblivious' that covers it approximately.	The amount of times I've gotten dating advice from girls that amounted to "You just need to wait for the right girl to come to you" makes me think most girls have no idea how dating works for guys. They just project their own experiences on men and assume that they're the same.
Guys, I just got rejected and the girl said "You are literally everything I want in a guy but you aren't good looking enough" I know this is cliché af but how am I supposed to feel?	What a tactless cunt geez. That said everybody has different taste. Even you would prefer some girls over others. You have the right attitude.	It's good, she was honest about it. You know where you stand and you can absolutely move on from her. Don't feel hurt. A lot of guys seem to think they will be attractive to the entire female population of the planet. But it's just not the case. So don't worry about it too much.
How can I deal with being ugly?	I think the fact you were able to post this and try to take a step at self improvement is beautiful in and of itself.	Start dressing for yourself and not in ways that you think will be pleasing to others. Find outfits that you personally just adore regardless of what others might think of your appearance. Wanna try some fun new mapeup? Dont wanna wear any at all? Do what feels right. The resulting confidence will make you feel better/happier and actually make you more attractive to other people. Sounds cliché, but clichés exist for a reason.
Women with invisible disabilities, what do you wish other people knew about your daily life?	It really irks me to hear my coworkers complain about how bad their back pain is when they don't have any actual, severe issues. And trust me, I've asked them. I know back pain, y'all. I have a malformed spine, ribcage, and hip from untreated childhood scoliosis. I can't carry anything at all when it's cold because then I can't move from the intense pain. Or bend over in the cold because I won't be able to get back up. When it rains, my right ribcage and entire mid-back just aches. I'm pretty strong for a small woman, but damn does it hurt. The amount of painkillers I take every day is killing my stomach, and when I don't eat, people get worried because I'm already so small!! It all just sucks. I wish people knew that even carrying around a backpack, or just standing for too long freaking *hurts*.	It’s hard to describe but sometimes it’s just that invisible disabilities make people TIRED. I have type 1 diabetes and I don’t even know how to sum it up other than by saying that I’m just tired. I’m always having hypoglycemic attacks and it just feels like it takes a toll physically and mentally. Edit: Elliott Smith also has a good line from his song on how things can get tough for people. “I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on I'm tired I'm tired”
A company promises you a lifetime supply of their products if you get a tattoo of their logo somewhere visible. What company is it and where do you put the tattoo?	Guyaki Yerba Mate... Leafy planet logo on my ankle for sure, and a lifetime of Bluphoria, Lemon Elation, Orange Exuberance, and Rebel Berry! No mint though. They can keep it.	I would go for a large pharmaceutical like Bayer or Pfizer. While I'm young, it would be cool to have free contraception&vitamins; when I'm old, medication for age-related diseases wil relieve me of a lot financial pressure. I guess I'd put Bayer logo on my arm, it'll look fine.
Men, what is the weirdest (or most unexpected, or most interesting) question a woman has asked you because something about men confused her? What was your answer?	"How can you be for equality and not call yourself a feminist?" Because I don't need labels to explain what I believe, I believe in treating everyone equally, with the same standards and same level of respect. What's not to get? :/	I knew a college girl (back when I was in college) and she was a virgin. I don’t remember how the conversation started, but a group of us were having drinks and the topic turned to sex. The virgin girl was asking a lot about penises and posed an interesting question. She asked if penises had bones in them. We all giggled a little bit, and I responded with “that’s why they call them boners”. It seemed as if a light was turned on and she finally understood. After a few minutes I broke the news to her that there are no bones in a male penis, and it’s more like a sock that holds blood. She seemed even more confused.
What hobbies are you interested in and want to try, but are too nervous/hesitant/need convincing still?	There are things I would like to do that I don't have the time or money to get into, but I can't think of ever being too *hesitant* to try a new hobby.	I wanna start weight-lifting and training, or maybe take some sort of martial arts or self defense class. Basically, I want to be tougher but I don't know where to begin!
Guys, how much detail do you tell your guy friends about girls after you've had sex with them?	I usually share with them if the girl was exceptionally hot, or someone we all know. Btw, I don't believe a damn soul in this thread that says they don't share. Believe what you want, but guys share, just like girls do.	I have some bottom-of-the-barrel degenerate friends, and I don't hear details like this from them. Worst I will get is unsolicited stories on technique. Women should understand that we know how each other's minds work, and most of us don't want friends imagining a girl we respect even the slightest in that way. In the very rare situations that friends have shared sex stories, it's usually about women they have no respect for and don't plan to see more than once or twice.
As far as looks are concerned, what are your deal breakers?	Tattoos Lesbian hair cut Not thin, slim, or toned Piercings outside the ear lobe Orangish brown skin from sun tanning abuse Edit: Funny how my preference for a conservative woman is wrong.	Obese. I'm fine with chubby or even a little fat, I'm no model of health either. But I do try to take care of myself and be healthy, and someone who just doesnt care and is obese, I just cant do that.
Had sex with a girl and didn't call her again. Found out she was upset and feel ashamed. How should I move forward?	Unless you've been clearly expressing the wish to start a relationship, she isn't entitled to one. I would just tell her "Listen, I'm sorry I didn't meet your expectations but I thought we were on the same page. Hurting you was the last of my intentions, I'd be happy to see you again as a friend but if you don't want to I'll understand."	She had sex with you without a commitment. You don't owe her anything more than to be polite and maybe don't tell many other people.
Men of reddit, how the hell do you deal with your oily face?	I have three rules for myself to avoid acne: 1. Wash my face twice a day 2. Avoid sugar like the plague 3. Don't masturbate This triad works really well for me. If I break any of the three rules, I break out. It might seem hard, but it gets easier as you stick to it. Disclaimer: I have no clue why masturbating makes me break out... I just know it does. I'm not one of those die hard fapstronauts, I just like having clear skin. Anyway, maybe give those three things a try. Good luck! PS Long bangs are bad too	Are you using a moisturizer after you wash your face? Even with oily skin (sometimes **especially** with oily skin) you should be moisturizing every time you wash your face. Also an SPF sunscreen in the AM every day. /r/SkincareAddiction is a great resource.
What is an insecurity that you only have because somebody else pointed it out to you?	I used to only shave my shins, with the rationale that most people can't really see/don't notice the hair on your knees and thighs because it's thinner. Then my friend "helpfully" point out that I'd forgotten to shave my thighs. Now I'm always anxious about it. Oh and my mom pointing out my mustache was super awesome.	I eat *really* fast and everyone thinks it's something worth teasing me about. I don't do it on purpose, it's just the way eat. Leave me alone, please.
Does the queer female gaze differ from the straight male gaze? If so, how?	Just a reminder that this is a question about how the queer female gaze might differ from the straight male gaze, and not an exploration about the existence of the male gaze, or how it's not really that bad. Any additional attempt to shift the conversation that way will be removed in violation of our derailing rule. Thanks.

What is the post painfully beautiful quote or song you have ever heard about heartbreak?	If we can be flexible with the term "heartbreak" Eminem has a lot of good ones, the dude knows how to tell a story. Stan, Kim, 25 to Life, Rock Bottom, When I'm Gone...	Can't think of just one, so here are my top three. "I'd leave you for the person you used to be." "there is no greater sorrow than to recall a time of happiness when in misery." "The worst feeling isn't being lonely; it's being forgotten by someone you could never forget."
What was your last straw with a former friend, where you said I don't ever want to see this person again?	Friend of mine was murdered really horribly, I rang another friend in tears and absolutely destroyed, asked her to come spend the day with me. Her response was "oh I have physio... and work later... maybe saturday?(it was thursday)" I was speechless, and hung up with her - later got a message that she couldn't do Saturday as she was busy. Found out later she was at a party with her boyfriend.	Me: -Gets phone call- Friend: XXXXXX stole $200 from me. I know because I went to take a shower and when I went back to my room it was missing from my wallet. She's the only one home. I used to live with XXXXXX and stuff would go missing constantly. I had a hunch it was her and could never prove it. As soon as she got caught, I was done with her. 25 years of best friendship be damned.
Would you date someone if they wanted to sleep in separated beds? Or different rooms?	No. I need to cling to when I get afraid at night. If he's a snorer, I make him getting a sleep apnea test (and a CPAP) one of my limits.	Absolutely. It would be my preference, actually. I'm possessive of my space and I like to sprawl out in bed. I don't mind sharing from time to time, but I'm most comfortable sleeping alone.
Men, how long did it take you to get over your ex? How did you do it? How long were you guys together?	Depends on the ex. Longest was like 3 weeks. Normal is two/three days, or whatever is closest to the weekend. What do you mean how? I stopped caring and slept with other people. Never had a relationship longer than 4 months.	It honestly took a couple of years. We were together for 4 years and I had already bought the ring. I just focused on bettering myself mainly. Learned a bunch of weird interesting hobbies/skills such as: lock picking, fencing, ballroom dancing, tae kwon do, racket ball etc... Really buckled down in school, studied hard improved my grade and got accepted into a great postgrad professional school. Got involved in clubs. Worked out. Volunteered. And I slowly started to realize hey. I'm an interesting guy who has a lot going for him. And each day I hurt less and less then one day I woke up and didn't hurt anymore. Soon after that I met my current girlfriend who is an amazing woman.

Do you experience secondhand embarrassment? When have you felt the most embarrassed for someone else?	Yeah, my mom doesn't always think before she speaks. She often asks women "when they are due" and doesn't realize they're just overweight. :/	Yes. So much that I want to find a way to fix it. Sometimes I will stop watching a movie or something because I know something embarrassing is coming up and I don't want to see it.
How has your perspective and expectation of women's bodies changed as you got older, if at all?	Not at all. Fitness is still the most important thing by far. If you start tolerating paunches and skinny fat as you get older, that turns into FUPAs and pig bellies soon enough, and you're a "shallow asshole" if you ask her to lose weight. Best just to find a parter who values being extremely fit in the first place	When I was way younger I was pretty into boobs. I feel like that has shifted over time and I'm much more of an ass man now.
Does beauty privilege exist, in your opinion?	No, I don't think it's anything like white privilege, unless you mean racist/eurocentric beauty standards. But I think on a small scale (not having to do with race) it probably exists, like within modeling or entertainment industries. For everything/everywhere else, there's makeup which I think can be very powerful and most definitely takes skill. I'm just not sure about the idea that unattractive people experience *systemic* institutional discrimination in the way that poc do / have throughout history so that comparison to me is kinda iffy. Unattractiveness is something that can be fixed or grown out of and plus it's subjective anyway. Race isn't like that & it's not treated that way. Edit: I think I'm just defining terms differently in my head.	Absolutely, at least from my personal experience. When I was very overweight and didn't put much thought into clothing or hair or appearance, the way people treated me differently was apparent in so many ways. Once I lost weight, started wearing makeup and doing my hair, wearing flattering clothing, the difference was night and day. It was everything from store employees approaching me to see if needed help while shopping, being able to flirt my way out of something, more people wanting to be my friend, taking my opinion seriously instead of brushing me off, and more opportunities in the workplace.
What is the biggest lie you've told?	"I love you." No, I don't...I have never loved you, and I will never love you. You are prejudiced, willfully ignorant, human trash. The world is sullied with your presence, and it will be cleansed of great evil when you die.	One night in my teens, I came home super stoned after smoking weed with some buddies. Parents are awake, see my eyes and start yelling at me since they're super anti-anything drug related. I wasn't too popular with the ladies at the time, so in the moment I tell them I was crying because I got shot down by a girl. Man did that shit work. They immediately begin to apologize, and I'm off the hook. The next morning my dad apologizes and hugs me over breakfast saying he's sorry, and my older brother who knew what was up gave me this look that screamed "You sneaky bastard."
A woman tells you she wants you to humiliate her during sex, without specifying how. Should you be worried about being too good at it?	I'd be worried about going too far and accidentally traumatizing her somehow. Not to mention I'm a virgin and have zero experience with sex, so I have no fucking clue how to "humiliate" somebody in bed.	no, but you should draw a line around what sort of humiliation is in play - "you're just a dumb slut, only good for keeping my cock warm": ok, "you drove your mother to drink": bad. remember, it's roleplay, and there are always limits.
Women who have gained or lost a lot of weight, how differently did family/friends/strangers treat you?	As I have aged and naturally gained weight into my adult body/set point, the difference is striking. Before, I was what I like to call "meta hot" - not actually that attractive, just thinwhiteblondetits etc. People paid attention to me, but superficially, to gain something, even subconsciously. I was seen as simultaneously more interesting and less intelligent. Strangers smiled more.	I've lost about 30 pounds \(only 24 more to go!\), and people feel the need to comment on just about everything I eat. If I get a salad, I get, "How can you eat that rabbit food?" Well, because this Asian chicken salad is fucking delicious! If I splurge and eat a burger, I get, "Aren't you on a diet?" Yes, and I've planned for this meal. One person in my life is really obnoxious about it. I follow Weight Watchers and any time I eat a small piece of candy or something, she'll say, "That's \[x\] points!" Yes, I fucking know. I literally just tracked it. Just let me eat a damn meal in peace!
What do I do if my friend's girlfriend dislikes me???	My best friend is female. My girlfriend has no problem with me being so close with her, but if she ever did I would choose my friend over my girlfriend. Your friend might not feel the same way though. Just be the bigger person and treat her better than she treats you. If she acts petty and you behave normally and your friend still chooses her over you, then he wasn't a friend worth having anyways.	Do you ever hang out with him and her? Maybe you should try to make friends with her by doing things together or something like a double date. That ways she'll see the nature of your friendship and might not worry as much.
What are some read-worthy romance books?	Nobody mentioned it, so I'll say The Hating Game by Sally Thorne. Up until today, it's one of the best romance novels I've read, and I've read plenty.	*cracks knuckles* Ok, Courtney Milan is amazing. The Duchess War, especially, but I also LOVE Unclaimed. Bec MacMaster writes big stakes, epic fantasy (and sci-fi) and some of the best sex scenes I've ever read. Highly recommend her London steampunk series. Sarah MacLean's Rules of scoundrels is also fantastic and I love the little universe she's built with that and her Love by numbers-series. Lucy Parker writes great contemporary, albeit a bit clean for my taste.
How do you feel about a guy who asks permission before going in for a first kiss?	Hon, if you have to ask...maybe you should first verbally establish whether or not this person is sexually interested in you and then read up on body language.	My boyfriend didn't quite ask, but when we were on our first date, toward the end of the night, I asked "What do you want to do now?" and he looked me in the eye and said, "Well, I kinda just want to kiss you." We've been together almost a year now.
How do you feel about your worst heartbreak now?	I just wonder once and a while if his wife knows what I do... Like, in hindsight years later, I'd really want to know what I know about him. But, I don't know her and no good would come of trying to get involved. It's been so long, I don't feel much of anything. It really feels like when I look back, it's like it was another lifetime altogether.	It still hurts once in a while. My ex-husband ended up marrying one of my best friends. They were together while we were married. I actually had a tougher time losing her than I did losing him. All those times I wanted to call her or text her to tell her something funny, I couldn't. When I started dating again, she was the first person that I wanted to tell. When I had a good date or a horrible date, I wanted to tell her. It was a rough for a while. I guess the only good thing that came of it is that she is now my kids stepmom, and I know she loves those kids like they are her own. The bad part about her being their stepmom is that there is a lack of boundaries. She oversteps a lot, and its frustrating.
Those who were called crazy by their ex, what's your story?	I told him assaulting someone is illegal and apparently that idea went against his politics (because the assailant was a god to him obviously) so I'm apparently both a nazi and a moron. Oh and the person who assaulted someone, ended up getting arrested for other things later. It's a shame really that party comes before morality. We had a generic, good friendship going until he freaked out like that. I think i got 2 posts in before he blocked me. Oh well. Lol no skin off my nose.	He wanted me to be emotionally and mentally unstable, because it was easier for him to control me that way, and control the way others viewed me and our relationship.
Guys, what are some of the WORST decisions you've ever made in your life?	Going to a big state school my freshman year, instead of community college. I transferred somewhere cheaper after a year, but I'm still $26k deep 4 years later.	Getting a DUI. Easily the most fucking idiotic thing I have ever done in my life. The fine itself was only $1500, but that doesn't include the other costs (i.e. 15 weeks of alcohol classes at $25 a class, 2 years of a breathalyzer at $85 a month, a bunch of miscellaneous court fees, losing my car and needing to buy another one). Just the court/class fees alone cost me nearly $4000. The downstream/cascading costs were incalculable. Probably another $5000 on top of that at least. I learned my lesson though. No taxi will ever charge you $5000 for a ride, so it's always worth it to take a cab, even if it's 50 bucks.
Does anybody here see themselves not getting married at all?	I will not be getting married because I have no interest in paying some women I used to sleep with half my money for the rest of my life.	I'm not getting married. Although, TBH I was married for about 9 months back in the early 80's. Unfortunately, she didn't understand what marriage meant and got Herpes from her boss. And in one of the most bizarre experiences a human can have, he attempted to buy me a hooker to make up for it. Yeah. That was weird.
What's a good mix dresses, skirts, blouses, slacks, jeans and tees for a girl going into the 4th grade?	Let her pick out her own clothes. Strangers like us cant know her style, she might not even want skirts.	I would say more casual stuff like jeans and t-shirts. A few nice special occasion outfits. If she likes to wear dresses and skirts, then more of those. Definitely a good pair of sneakers. At 9 years old, she will be able to tell you what she likes, and as an adult you know what is practical. I work in an elementary school and I would say most 4th grade girls wear a mix of jeans/shorts and skirts with cute t-shirts and sweaters. A few very athletic girls wore mostly track suit type pants and t-shirts. Let her pick her outfits within reason but make sure to get a variety :)
Who here is a big fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender/Avatar: Legend of Korra? Who is your favorite character? What's your favorite thing about the franchise?	I loved Korra as a series, but Avatar is very special to me because I grew up with it and it sort of shaped me as a person. (I want a water tribe tattoo one day...) My favorite characters hands down are Zuko for his character development, and Toph because she's strong and doesn't need anyone. Edited because of words, whoops.	Toph is my favorite character. My favorite thing about the franchise is having multiple female characters of different personalities and therefore avoiding the dreaded Smurfette Principle which is one female character is expected to represent all girls/women.
What's the single most romantic gesture you've ever received?	Just the most recent of late, I have a mad crush on the hottest man, I am a major baseball freak in a text I asked him if he wanted to come up to see a tier 2 world series ring from a friend, not knowing If he even liked baseball, well he said no thanks, it was his favorite teams arch rival, so he says no thanks a dodger and Yankee fan. Just melted my heart, lame I know...	I didn't get to go to my senior prom because I was performing in a show that night at the community theater. I was 18 and he was 20. We had fallen for each other quickly and during the beginning of summer, we had this sort of crazy infatuation with each other. We'd only been seeing each other a few weeks when this happened, it was the night of one of my shows performances and the night of my prom. He picks me up after the show and drives me out to this empty road, pulls the car over and turns on the song from The Notebook that Noah and Ally danced to in the middle of he street and said "I know I can't take you to your prom but can I have this dance?" And we danced in the middle of the empty street and it was perfect.
What do you think can/should be done about male suicide, depression, and mental illness in general?	Slow change in cultural issues surrounding vulnerability and expression for males. Have parents tell their sons that it's okay to show emotion (within reason, of course) and ignore toxic masculine ideas. And for the adults, figure out what works for men in dealing with suicide and depression/ mental illness. We hear so much that x was designed for men, and women have their own needs associated with x. I think it's similar, men may not benefit from women and children's support systems simply repackaged for men.	Destigmatizing mental illness and providing treatment are good, but they're band-aids. I want to know why my fellow men are so depressed and suicidal. What are the underlying causes? Is there anything we can do to prevent men from needing treatment in the first place?

What differences have you noticed in how people treat you when you started to put an effort in how you look?	The day i stopped caring about what others thought about me and just enjoyed who i am... thats what changed everything around. Its your attitude that gets you treated differently. Not the way you look.	Not a direct answer to the question, but I just want to say that when I put effort in, I act differently because I feel more confident and attractive. That in itself affects how people react to me.
Ex dumped me a week after he arrived in a another country as an exchange student for 4 months, not even two and a half weeks later he's in a relationship. What has an ex done that made you think, really dude...?	this thread makes me sad.. im a guy and these dudes sound like total assholes i got cheated on and id never do it to anyone	Soliciting one of my close friends for a hookup via Facebook within a week of us breaking up. REALLY DUDE?!
What are your thoughts on taking a consenting disabled individual to a sex worker?	I think that's very sweet. Just find a decent escort, don't just pick up someone on the street. Do your research and find the right girl for him. Swap a few emails back and forth, and don't be afraid to ask the girls for recommendations on who they think might be good if they don't want to do it. Just understand that most won't discuss actual sex acts over email.	If It were me, I would. Just take all the necessary precauctions. Make sure he understands the situation and don't let him think that it's anything other than pay for sex. Explain that the woman are doing it for money and even if they say they like you it isn't true.
How do you gain control over your emotions?	Don't talk about them! That's it. Just don't vocalize them to other people. Easiest way to put it? Tought it up dude!	Meditation helps a lot. Try sitting for 5 minutes at first and go longer as you build up practice. Headspace has a great app and has 10 free 10 minute meditations to begin. It helped me immeasurably and I eventually bought a year membership. Cant recommend it enough. /r/Meditation if interested....
Ladies, I got broken up with. But juicy secrets always seem to bring me up. What is the biggest, juiciest, moistest secret you know and how did you learn it?	I dont know if this is juicy enough but here it goes. I have a male friend, lets call him X, who is probably secretly bisexual/gay. I learned this from another male friend, Y, after they had gone camping together in a large group of friends. One night after everyone was going to sleep after heavy drinking X went into Y's tent and started groping him and coming on to him. Y pushed him off and asked him to leave. They never spoke about it after that and acted as if it never happened, but according to Y it definitely did happen. And X wasn't confused thinking that it was a girl because X was saying/moaning Y's name when he was in the tent...	One of my coworkers (N) at my last internship got pregnant by her best friend's fiancé. They had been sleeping with each other for awhile, and they all worked in the same area together. N passed out at work a few times, and found out she was pregnant. She ended up flying home way early saying that she had diabetes because she couldn't function at hey job anymore. She's decided to follow through with the pregnancy but hasn't told anyone, so all her facebook photos are zoomed in to her face. But recently someone tagged her in the back ground of a picture at a BBQ and her baby bump is large and in charge. Her best friend commented with a simple "wtf?" Before it got deleted. I can't wait to see how this turns out.
What has an ex ruined for you?	I'm going to get downvoted but fuck it. Not to derail, but I don't think that askmen should do this. The top posts in askwomen are frequently about how abused you were, how guys fucked you over and how much men suck. Askmen should aspire to be better than that. Women don't suck. Women haven't ruined us. All exes, regardless of gender, deserve each other.	My ex ruined relationships for me. Its been 3 years, i have a romantic person tucked somewhere deep... but i cant seem to open up to a new person emotionally. Ive been called jaded, but the effort just seems like too much to try again, and even if i did... i cant seem to get that comfortable "i want to spend time with you" like i used to
What’s your experience with crying at work?	I just learned last week that before everyone knew my name at work I was known as “the one who cries”. So your one time thing is seriously no big deal! Even if you cried a bunch more, no big deal. :)	I’ve never cried in a meeting with multiple people but I have cried twice in a closed door meeting with my boss. I cry when I’m anxious and she’s a raging narcissist who totally went off on me out of the blue. I wish it hadn’t happened, but it’s been awhile now and I rarely think about it anymore. I’ve also learned how to handle her thanks to therapy, so it’s unlikely to happen a third time.
What's it like to marry the only person you've ever dated?	Not certain, am unmarried. I am curious to how it's like if you are less experienced and/or a late bloomer seeing/dating/married someone with an extensive or more richly varied breadth of experience. *asking for a friend*	It is pretty nice overall. I was never much into dating around or the hookup culture and was a bit cynical about relationships because my family is so dysfunctional. I spent my 20s alone and traveling and enjoying my time, met my husband at 28, got married at 32, almost 35 now. Every now and then I wish I'd had sex with other men besides my husband before we met, but sex is very vulnerable and intimate to me so I feel like I spared myself a lot of heartbreak and sorrow. Plus, all the time alone before he and I met made me strong and independent and helped me love and accept myself on my own.
Girls, which do you prefer, tampon or menstrual pads, and why?	Fucking neither. If I don't have to work I just make frequent trips to the bathroom, take plenty of showers, and use panty liners. My flow is weird and really heavy in the beginning but if I use a tampon during the day it works for a couple hours but then it stops my flow and comes out full force at night when I'm not using one. I fucking hate pads too. I hate it all. Dealing with a period just sucks. Towards the end of my cycle it's not a big deal but at the beginning I'll use tampons if I have to. I've never tried a cup but my flow is pretty heavy so I think it'd be more inconvenient than anything.	Tampons by far. I've used them since day one. Pads make me feel like I'm just sitting in it for hours and it's really uncomfortable for me. Plus tampons just seem more practical to me for some reason. Pads are also less environmentally friendly, though neither are ideal.
What's the WORST piece of advice you've heard on Reddit?	"My boyfriend said something the other day that irked me. It wasn't a big deal but I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting?" "***YOU AREN'T. DUMP HIM AND MOVE ON. YOU OWE NO ONE ANYTHING AND SHOULD STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. BURN ALL YOUR BRIDGES NOW SO THAT YOU CAN FINALLY BE AN ADULT.***" "Thanks! I hadn't seen things that way!"	There's the legal advice thread where someone told the OP to go around and talk to as many lawyers as possible about their divorce so that their spouse couldn't find an impartial lawyer. Which is apparently illegal (or makes you responsible for some kind of damages).
Has anyone here fallen for someone whose personality won you over before their looks? Would you tell them? How would you feel if your partner made a similar statement about you?	I've never dated an Adonis. I go for a looks/personality combo, personality being more important. The last big crush I had before my current SO was a short, balding man. Why would I tell him that his personality was more important than his looks? There is no benefit to that.	Yes, absolutely. I'd probably not say that. If a similar statement were made to me, I'd probably be a little hurt. Look, I know I'm not a good-looking woman. I'd prefer that just be an unspoken truth between us; I don't need to have it acknowledged like I didn't know.
What's the biggest Tinder "red flag" you've encountered?	Theres a really cute guy who appears as a match on OKC but his profile has "feminist as long as you understand it means equality for all" and it makes me angry.	I’m no longer on dating sites because I’ve met someone, but I was always creeped out by the dudes who insisted on meeting right away/that same night or meeting at their house. No thanks.
What do you want out of a wife?	Someone who matches me in ambition, greed, drive for self improvement, and brutal honesty. Intelligence, desire for biological immortality, and the belief in improving/replacing body parts with tech is pretty necessary too. You know. A partner.	It sounds cliche, but communication, I've been married almost 20 years and the key for us has always been communication, IF something is bothering her, I want her to let me know, don't keep it bottled up until you explode, SAY something.
Guys how did you find something worth living for?	To change the world. Make things that make it better. No matter how small a thing or that change may be. (I'm an engineering student)	My reason to live is spite against life itself tbh. I've survived this long and life isn't going to kill me.

Women who don’t talk to their siblings anymore, what’s the story?	She is so happy that I feel if I call/contact her I will ruin her happiness... My awesome sister 😟	He’s the oldest of 5, I’m the youngest (15 years apart). Rough childhoods, had to be on welfare, we were living at the YWCA when I was born, dad is also super shitty person. My super republican brother, during a text argument because I posted something on FB about how most people on welfare don’t want to be and actively try to get off (like our mother), he thought I should know that I was a product of rape via our father, not wanted, our mother shouldn’t have had me (but abortion is bad?), and his life would have been better had I not been more because he would have had more than 1 pair of jeans to wear to school and wouldn’t have been made fun of because of it. He has 2 boys now, 10 and 12, who are both severely mentally unwell because of his parenting style.
What are some things about you that would make most Reddittors hate you?	I'm a southern sorority girl who loves bros. I'm not a feminist, but I believe in equality - I think women (in first world countries) should go prove that they're equal by working just as hard as men do instead of complaining about their triggers behind a keyboard. I grew up with nothing, an alcoholic father, whole nine yards blah blah, put myself through school at a prestigious private university, and now I'm making a great, successful life for myself because I WORKED HARD. Sure men have discriminated against me but that's because they, individually, are dumbasses. As a whole I've found that most men respect women, and if you're around men who don't, you need to find better friends. No one was put on this planet to hand you things, if you want it, go out and take it.	i like to start passionate arguments and then halfway through laugh it off and say "yeah, you're probably right." and just walk away.
What was the "last straw" in your past relationship for you?	After years of neglect, I cheated on him. I cut things off once I realized how horrible I was. I came clean after I caught him cheating on me. We agreed we'd work on things. Caught him still talking to her after we had had a big blow up about the 6 years of a passionless marriage. I noped out of that marriage leaving almost everything I owned behind. It wasn't even the cheating. How could I be mad about something I'd also done? It was the lying.	we were together 5 years. he broke his arm the same week my mom committed suicide. our relationship had been falling apart the last year anyway, but he told me I "hadn't been there enough for him since his injury" and I needed to "move on and get over it already." my mother hadn't even been cremated yet.🙁 I moved out that day and left the majority of my shit there. it was hard considering I paid for the place mostly, but I had to go.
Men who are frequently rejected by women: how do you stay confident? What helps you continue to approach other women after you've been rejected over and over again?	Only approach women who are out of your league and you expect rejection from. **NEVER** approach women who are beneath you and risk rejection from them. Think about it. If you apply for a job as CEO of a major corporation and get rejected, who cares? It's what was expected. But when you apply for a job working the front line at the local car wash and get rejected, that hurts! How fucking awful are you that the goddamn carwash won't even hire you?	Take honest stock of what you actually have to offer. If it's good, then keep going. If not, work on improving yourself. And understand that dating isn't a war zone. It's an audition. Just because you're not right for the part doesn't mean you're bad. Edward Norton is a hell of an actor, but you wouldn't cast him as the lead in a Martin Luther King Jr. biopic.
What subscription services do you use?	- IADC Safety Alerts. - OGP Safety Alerts. - Manufacturer Technical Bulletins. - NOPSEMA alerts and bulletins. - UK HSE alerts and bulletins. - WorkSafe WA alerts and announcements. - SPE notices. - APPEA notices. - Various other industry and technical sources.	Spotify. I love it. I get to legally pay for my music, I can take it on the go, it's extremely good quality and I like that musicians do get some of my money and that fact that I might not like some albums that you'd pay a fairly large amount for. It's opened up music for me, I'd never pay for it legally otherwise.
What was your first breakup like?	I cheated on my first girlfriend with a girl from my school who I had been crushing on for years, so I kinda had it coming. The main thing that hurt was the guy she left me for a month later, this tiny ratty looking motherfucker who was two years younger than me.	This was ten years ago. Started to date at the end of high school (she was my prom date). She went off to college but I was still at home since my school started two weeks later. We were talking on the phone and just the way she sounded - like she was dancing around the subject - was too obvious "Are you breaking up with me?" "...yes..." "Okay," Then we kept talking for an hour about college. We're still friends
At what age did you develop a sense of how attractive you were?	When will you guys realise. Your concept of "attractive" is not entirely the same from the girls' point of view. Attractiveness for girls is a mixture of looks and the way you make them feel; a culmination of many attributes. If you look nice but are ugly on the inside, there's a chance that you are not as attractive as you have been led to believe.	I'm 21 and have recently realized that the fact that I seem to be more or less invisible to the opposite sex is probably a good sign I'm not exactly the spiciest jalapeño on the block.
Inspired by an AskWomen Thread: Bicurious men who have tried having sex with men, what made you dislike it?	Definitely the kissing aspect or anything sensual. It’s definitely a shame most women are wet fish by comparison in the bedroom. Edit: Am really sorry but there is much more zest I’ve found in men over women. It’s my experience not saying it’s true all over and that’s the question the OP asked so get over it	Honest answer. I dont know. Kissing heavy petting all that shit, up and eager. Reached the bedroom, stripped off ready to go and BOOM, soft, couldn't get it back up.
Men who met the love of your life young (let's say early 20s), how did you make your relationship strong, mature and longlasting despite your age?	This is probably not the same for everyone, but what we do is try to keep some variety in the bedroom. We were high school sweethearts, and at the time we were very into BDSM. She would walk me around the hallways on a leash and give me dog treats. We were in love. Every 6 months or so, we change it up. From BDSM we went to watersports. From watersports to inflation. From inflation to crossdressing. From crossdressing to food. From food to scat and on and on. I actually proposed to her recently by putting a ring up my ass and having her use an enema to clean out my anus and make the ring fall out. Our wedding is coming up and we're gonna name the tables after different kinks.	Communication and determination. People grow so quickly during these years, and it's rare that they grow in parallel fashion. It's important to communicate about **everything,** and to discuss issues until you come to a satisfactory resolution. I find a lack of communication and openness to be the foremost flaw in most young couples. Determination is key because you're not going to be able to stand to be in close proximity to any single human ever (let alone the love of your life) if you don't consciously make the choice to stand by them through anything, and love them **and** their flaws. Lasting love is a choice, a conscious and continuous commitment; it does not happen on accident. Especially not in such turbulent and defining years of one's youth.
The US fertility rate crashed to just 1.80 from 2.10 in only 6 years (2010 to 2016). What are the possible drivers for such a massive change in such a short timeframe?

Men who have been cheated on, what are some red flags that made you suspect that your partner was cheating on you?	I was with somebody for 2 years. I knew as they weren't being their normal selves, we wasn't having sex as much, we was arguing more, she was just being completely off. I then got told a "rumour" that she fucked someone else so I ended it. Now she works in a bar fucking her boss and I'm a salesman with a lovely new car and happier than ever. Conclusion - I'm sure you'll know, I'm not good at reading people but to me it was just obvious.	Vagina tastes like spermicide on condoms. We were married and didn't use condoms. For the record I never intentionally ate a condom but I worked at a condom factory for about a year and when you are surrounded by nonoxyinol 9 and w. messes you know what it smells / tastes like.
Women of /r/askmen... do you feel welcome here?	Gonna chime in here, I find AW to be a more safer place place to post. Now and then I see racist and misogynist comments upvoted highly. I got a few hostile PMs from people here too, so this subreddit doesnt really feel much different than a default reddit. On the other hand, AW feels more civil and aware of social issues. To be honest, the way people describe AW feels totally inaccurate. It's not easy to get banned, and isn't a censorship-happy place. Just don't be an asshole and be a little more sensitive when commenting, it's not that hard.	It really depends on the topic and the post. Most of the guys here are really cool and seem very receptive to my two cents. I've been pleasantly surprised by the outreach I have gotten through comments and PMs. I like to think I'm a part of the community here, but there is sometimes this lingering feeling I'm an outsider looking in. In terms of hostility or feeling marginalized, I have a pretty thick skin. If I mention anything with regards to feminism, affirmative action, or dating being difficult for women, I know I'm not going to have a popular opinion. However, I genuinely enjoy the heated debates and even when we disagree, I find everyone respectful.
What's the weirdest most bizarre thing you caught your SO doing?	Ugh, NOTHING, I'm ALWAYS the weird one. Dammit. Watching Akira, maybe? Or I've woken up to him watching movies on his phone with headphones next to me	He disappeared for a few minutes longer than usual when he goes to the bathroom and the toilet had already flushed so I got up to see what he was getting in to. I walked around the corner to the bathroom and see him standing in his boxers inspecting one of my tampons. I watched him silently as he tried to figure out how it worked and his face when he pushed the applicator and it popped out was so hilarious I started laughing and he saw me. It was so hilarious.
How weird do you get when you're alone?	Dude here... I make chewbacca noises when cringy thoughts pop in my head when I'm alone. I also sniff anything that comes out of my body.	I deliberately amplify the sounds of my farts & burps and I sniff my farts. When around others, I make sure these functions go unheard/unsmelt. I also have this weird laugh that I do when I'm looking at funny things on the internet and I'll laugh hysterically by myself while staring at my computer screen.
What is a tradition you and your SO have?	To never talk to each other again as long as we both shall live. OK, she's ex, but still significant.	He goes to work much earlier than I do in the morning. He gets up early, showers & eats breakfast, then comes back to bed for cuddles until my alarm goes off. Then he gets dressed and waits for me to come downstairs to kiss him goodbye when he leaves. It's a routine I miss deeply when he's deployed.
[NSFW] Men who have paid for a professional massage that ended in a happy ending, what was the experience like?	Professional massage ≠ happy ending I'm in massage school in NY, I can tell you most places that offer happy ending massages are dealing in sex slavery.	Used to live in Okinawa, went to a couple different ones over the course of two years. Honestly, it was like any other retail business. Sometimes you got great service, sometimes you got a shitty massage and refused the handjob. I worked a very physical job and long hours (16 hour days, 30+ days with no time off was regular) at the time, so often just the rubdown and conversation with a good looking girl was worth the $40. Besides, it was nice to know that the girl wasnt some deployed guy's wife, you know?
What is some female club/bar behavior that you don't appreciate?	Dancing/dressing like a thot and then turning down every guy that approaches her in the most dramatic fashion possible. I'm not here to boost your self-esteem.	Trying to get me to buy them drinks. It's 2017 and if you want to flirt you'll have to do better than, "spend money on me".
For those of you with mental health disorders, what would you like to get off your chest regarding your disorder?	I'd like to point out that Autism and Asperger's syndrome and all of the other lovely things on the spectrum are NOT DISORDERS. Autistics and Aspies are not worth less than normals. So stop implying that - I don't want your pity, I just want you to respect my boundaries.	Just because I have depression does not mean I'm *sad*. Actually I'm more ... nothing. I can't feel, can't care, can't really muster up the energy to have any emotions at all, besides maybe hopelessness at the fact that I can't really feel anything. When the depression is at its worst, being able to feel sadness would be considered an improvement. I hate that depression has the name it does, because in my experience it's so, so much worse than being sad.
Ladies who were bullied because of your looks, when was the first time you realized someone was genuinly attracted to you?	I was 21. Suddenly men stared checking me out, flirting etc. like a switch had been flipped. No idea why or what it was due to, really. But it was confusing and even annoying. Go figure.	When I realised he was rock hard after a couple of minutes of making out... was an awesome moment I’ll never forget
Ladies, have you ever quit your job on the spot?	I quit my part-time serving job a few hours before my shift. I absolutely could not stand to work another day there. I live in PA, USA and my company has an "At-Will" clause and I can quit any time for any reason. I felt *so relieved*. I hated working there. The shift was going to be a long, grueling seven hours of nonsense, making shit for money. Every day since, I look back and am SO happy I did it. I deserved it. I hated that job and it makes terrible money working long hours doing too much side work for $2.83/hour. I have a great employment record so this "incident" is insignificant to me. I also check on their Google reviews every now and then and am secretly pleased to see their star rating go down. (At a 3.9 out of 5 right now)	My last workplace was a bit of a nightmare at times. It was a casual and low key environment but the owner could be intense and the clients were stressful. Combine that with low pay and you have a revolving door of employees. There were so many times I wanted to leave, but I was worried about finding another job quickly. I decided to stick it out until I could secure a new job. It took me about 6-7 months to find a new workplace and it was well worth the wait. My current job pays me twice as much and provides some of the best benefits in the country. Meanwhile, I had a coworker that decided to quit on the spot. It’s probably been a little over two years since then and she still hasn’t found something stable. She’s pretty much been interviewing ever since.
Men, what's the most offensive thing someone can say to you, and why is it so bad?	I can't think of anything that could be said that would offend me. Actually, I'm having a hard time even imagining what being offended even feels like.	I have a stutter. Well, more like a stammer at the very beginning of words. When people say "slow down and think about what you want to say", it infuriates me. I already know the exact sentence I'm going to say. That is the worst thing you can say to someone with that type os speech impediment.
What’s your most complimented perfume?	When I'm not wearing any. Srsly. People always tell me I smell great and ask what I'm wearing. It's usually Johnson and Johnson baby soap and cocoa butter.	I once spilled a french vanilla coffee on myself, and got more compliments about how good I smelled than any perfume I’ve ever worn...does that count?
How did you successfully develop confidence, self esteem, and overcoming fear of doing new things?	I started be actively aware of the stuff that pushed my boundaries and intentionally did them. Obviously safe boundaries not "let's do all the drugs"kind of stuff. I played it safe the majority of my life. There a knowing in living it to the "wow this is fun" and the learning of "hold up not fun anymore." Old me would have overanalyzed pros and cons. I also developed a sort of code on how to treat people by. It's amazing how just smiling, listening and generally just being nice can make you feel like you're being seen by others.

Women in the sex industry, have you ever encountered a "Nice Guy" who tried to woo you? How did it go?	Reminder: all rules are still in place. No derailing and no invalidation. I don’t care if you really really really want to tell someone you don’t believe them or they’re wrong, keep it to yourself. If you don’t reveal how stupid you are, no one will ever know.

Dad's of reddit, do you ever regret having kids?	Not one bit. Is it demanding? Sure. Is there frustration? Yes. Is there sacrifice? God yes. But there is nothing--NOTHING--like the joy of being a dad. Rocking your child to sleep, seeing all of their "firsts", experiencing the wonder of life through a fresh pair of eyes...it is like reliving childhood. 10/10 would recommend	No. Having kids was one of the defining events of my life. And it changed me fundamentally. I don't recommend it for everyone. It takes a lot out of you, emotionally, physically, and yes, financially. But it also can make you a better person, less self centered, more in touch with your mortality, and it has the potential to give you the most rewarding relationships of your life. No one is ready to have kids. Before I had kids I thought of myself as invulnerable and probably immortal. I now know that I can be hurt, deeply. I'm driven to keep my kids healthy and happy. And I have great hopes that they will be better people, smarter, kinder, more capable, than I am.
Women who don't shower everyday, what is your reason?	**STATUS: Locked for moderator clean-up** We get it. There are many people who cannot fathom other people having habits that differ from yours. However, all of your moral indignation at the idea that other people don't shower every day is not an answer to the question this OP is posing.	**STATUS: Locked for moderator clean-up** We get it.

Men who date women 'half your age': What are the pros and cons?	Pros: 1. More saved money as she doesnt require fancier outings or more expensive drinks/dinners/etc. 2. More free time on her hands to be with you 3. More energy on her end, usually more sex too. 4. Shes more childish making her able to let loose more easily but can also dress well and look stunning when a more serious occasion requires it. 5. Is likely a student and isnt held up by a job and its stresses. Cons: 1. Older women mad as fuck 2. Schoolwork can hold her up sometimes. 3. Probably a slut because "omfg its college."

Why is it controversial wanting women to cover up their breasts when breastfeeding?	Okay, if I go out to a restaurant and I got all dressed up, maybe wearing a nice suit and the person I'm out with is also dressed up. That is not an appropriate time to breast feed. There are some places and times when I don't care what gender it is, if you start taking off you clothes, I am going to be bothered by it. This is coming not from any sexualized side but simply a decency or right time right place kind of thing. And yes, I've been at a restaurant before that was decent and seen a woman start to breast feed. It was an inappropriate moment and didn't need to be done in front of a restaurant full of people.	How are you defining covered up? Because I've never seen more than the top of the boob when a woman is breastfeeding in public. Not much more than you'd see with a low cut top.
What companies are you making a point of boycotting and what companies do you make a point of supporting?	My shopping is more based on local/American made vs imported, but I intentionally avoid anywhere that champions Planned Parenthood over community health centers. So basically, anything Warren Buffett and George Soros own I don't touch.	Ticket master. Fuck their ticket fees, admin charges and card fees and fuck their customer service if an event is cancelled, postponed or for whatever reason you can't make it to the gig. I buy all my tickets direct from the venue now where I can
Ladies, what products have tried recently that are complete game changers?	Not a lady, but my girlfriend bought an epilator(sp?) and it has been awesome. She gets around a thousand times more leg massages now that she's not all prickly. And I get these weird hairs on my upper arms and that thing has almost taken care of those which I love. It hurts like hell but is totally worth. Especially if you want calf and thigh and foot massages nightly and your SO is like me and doesn't like massaging sandpaper.	I switched to buying Old Spice men's deodorant. I like the Wolfthorn. All the lady deodorants don't seem to last, even the clinical stuff. My friend recommended it (she uses Foxglove) and I don't think I will ever by ladies' deodorant again.
Have you ever been served something disgusting but felt compelled to eat it (meeting SOs parents, business dinner, etc.)? If so, what was the offending food and how did you deal with it?	I'm a super picky eater. I was at this nice restaurant and they had a special 4 course menu for the week and it was really cheap. I was really broke, and everyone else was going with that and talking about how they were gonna pick different things and share. So I went with it... I thought it would be ok. It wasn't. I didn't like any of it. I'm sure the food would have been amazing for someone who wasn't picky, but I am! Luckily, I felt bad and blamed not eating everything on the fact that I didn't feel good... but man. And then to make matters worse, my sweet friend paid for mine because he knew I was broke. I felt so bad after that.	went to thanksgiving with a friend i had a crush on. her mother was kind of wacky and crazy and she made this dish that she was bragging about all day and insisted everyone take a GIANT spoonful of, while she watched them. the dish? apricots and pureed sweet potatoes baked with cilantro, nuts, pepper, and sugar, in a big casserole dish covered with shredded cheddar. ... horrible.
What's your "I stuck my dick in crazy" story?	I don't know if it counts. As a kid I had to put on jeans before going shopping with my family. I was too lazy to put on underwear. Well while zipping up my pepe got stuck in the fly. We called the ambulance and they had to cut my whole jeans but in the end I got free. To this day I have a scar on it.	Things were going well with this gal so we moved in. She was changing up her birth control and went off the depo shot (which apparently has some very nasty side effects if not renewed). She picked fights almost perpetually, over stuff like the color of her shoes and would stay upset for no less than 6 hours at a time. She was inconsolable after being moved in after two months. Twice she tried to jump out of my moving car while we were driving home. After a couple more months of the patterns escalating, I issued the ultimatum to get help medically, psychologically, something, and after a month no action so I moved out. At least the other housemates were around to validate that she was going nuts, it definitely made me feel like I was taking crazy pills myself having to defend myself most days of the week.
Men who will forever be the "Asshole ex" to one or more of your exes, what happened and how does it feel to be remembered in that way?	I don't think there are many people that would think I was the asshole if they knew the whole story. I think I was very kind and generous and I feel like I made every effort to try and show her that I was the person that she could be with forever. In the end, I feel like she needed me to be the asshole so I will wear that mantle for her. I still love her, but the feels fade more and more everyday. I guess that's the way things work though right?	I was too much of a pussy, should have ended things 6 months before I did. She was head over heels in love with me and I wasn't with her. Created a lot of resentment and pointless arguments
How do you feel about your SO's porn watching and how do you deal with it?	O my ex watched it alot. He worked 2nd shift and would drink every day/night and watch it, beat it then get in bed with me. Came to the point was interfering with our sex life. We even watched together and had sex on cam. I was showing off his price Albert. Guess I wasn't good enough. O well I told him hit the road with his Hep C self. I've been tested im clear	There's not a right way to feel about it. It's normal to be fine with it, and it's normal to not be. I think it's a good idea to know why you feel how you do and be willing to discuss it. But I feel like, maybe especially on Reddit, there's this overall attitude that it's something you have to embrace, or at the very least ignore, or else you're definitely insecure/controlling/whatever - and that's just not the case. If it doesn't bother you, that's fine. But if it does, it's not wrong or weird to feel that way.
What's the best vacation you've been on?	Great Wolf Lodge in Sandusky, OH. You can drink beer while the kids play and my husband and I and the kids all got along perfectly nobody was grouchy. My kids are old enough now to sit down in a restaurant and eat so that made it really nice. I love vacation.	A few years ago, I booked a two week solo trip to the Philippines for the sole purpose of scuba diving and beach bumming. I spent almost every morning diving (it was literally like Finding Nemo under the water) until about noon, then spent the afternoons reading on the beach. Then at night, I would sit down and dine with random cool tourist from other parts of the world that came to also dive. It was so relaxing and just a ton of fun.
What harsh truths made you a BITTER man?	That I can bust my ass building up my company, and if some weasel cocksucker politician decides he/she wants to have some pet project and increase taxes, I have no choice but to pay. Doesn't matter it mostly tends to benefit people who contribute zero to society.	You can do everything right and still lose. It's life but it makes you wonder why you spent so long trying so hard for nothing.
What's something non-sexual you only do in private?	Say random things, like nonsensical statements. Singing completely off key, that too usually not real songs just shit from my mind. Crying but not sobbing like a bitch or the emotional tears in the eyes but this weird half sob that I do to just get a feeling out of my system. Stank face and fist pump when something good happens.	Sometimes when I am really really down, I watch that 3 minute end of the one Simpsons episode where Homer went back to his hated job as Marge qas pregnant with Maggie, and he was punished with the demotivational plaque (Don't forget, you're here forever) and he later used Maggies pictures to cover it in a way that it reads Do it for her. And cry for 10 minutes. Then the world is a better place.
What is the dumbest thing a man has ever said to you about women?	"Men are like dogs and women are like cats. Men are happy-go-lucky, while women will claw your eyes out when you least expect it." I have heard this from multiple men. In each case, it was a man who was trying to get me to date him.	I'm 20 years old. These guys were 18-19. They told me that having sex with pregnant women was dangerous for the baby since it meant that you could poke the baby's soft skull. It took me an hour to convince them that they were wrong.
Is it off-putting if a woman suggests going dutch or splitting the bill on a first date?	Not to me. I actually insist on that anyway, which frightens away a lot of prostitutes who think they are classy women.	Absolutely not, it means you're financially independent and aren't just expecting to freeload a meal out of me. But if someone still insists on paying, they want to treat you, so I wouldn't continue pushing in that case.
Women of Reddit who have been successful in love, what would you tell your younger selves when you were single and feeling all alone in the world?	Dogs will give you the unconditional love that you're trying to get from a boyfriend and vibrators will give you the orgasms that you're trying to get from a boyfriend	Here’s some cliches that young me needed to hear: - Stop chasing people who are running from you. - stop trying to “save” people. Broken people will only break you - don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm
Who's a male sex symbol whose sexiness is a complete mystery?	James Deen (porn star). >"Porn is so wrong and degrading to women!" >"James Deen is like sooooo hot, and his adult films are for some reason acceptable whereas all other porn is terrible trash."	Ed Sheeran. That dude gets to hang out with Victoria's Secret models. I don't get it. Really though it's probably just because he can sing so well.
Have you ever been completely oblivious to a woman's signs of interest? What was the story? When did you finally pick up on it?	I have a feeling that this thread will be abused to give comfort: "Oh.... so maybe she was into me all along, I just never realized it." The problem with not realizing that a woman was interested in you is that you did not realized it. So you can not report it here. In conclusion, I think that many stories here will be fed with fantasy, at least to a certain degree.	She said "take a shot and I will kiss you". I said "Nah, I'm good." Then turned and walked away. My friend's face who was standing right there was priceless and almost worth it.
How many of you would date a single mom and how many would not?	30+ m here. No way in the world I would date a single mom beyond a fuck buddy. Being a single mom indicates you are generally a very, very, very poor decision maker and engaged in reckless behavior. I'm not going to be beta bucks for someone else's kid. I don't need the drama with an ex, custody, visitation, etc.. The relationship question you need to ask is why would any guy want to date a single mom? What's in it for a guy? What advantages are there with a single mom over a younger, child free single women You may not want to have kids, but I might, as in one of my own with my DNA. Everything isn't about you.	I'm 40. I would not date a single mother again. Essentially helped raise a kid for 4 years and then the mother and I broke up. I was more heartbroken over the loss of the daughter than I was the mother. I still think about her everyday.
Ladies, do you have a personal health "secret" that you swear by?	D-Mannose and a fuckton of water at the first sign of a UTI. I also did a regimen of homemade douches (hydrogen peroxide and apple cider vinegar) with probiotic vaginal suppositories to cure my bacterial vaginosis once. (If anyone is interested in knowing more, let me know; I have a detailed blog post which explains this more fully.)	When i find myself getting in a pattern, I always try and do things differently than I have done before. I think it keeps my brain young. Like a fighter pilot or an animal in the jungle, I'm constantly evaluating and exploring my surroundings. TL/DR: I randomly rotate my choice of bathroom stalls at work.
What mental state you’re in right now?	very happy, i’ve got that new girlfriend high right now after being alone for way too long and I can see it going for a long time right now	Since college started, I'm that friend to people when they need to talk about their feelings, but not the one they'd prefer hanging around with. It kind of sucks, when I'm left to my own devices in the aftermath of a personal crisis, but at least you cared enough to ask. I don't mean to stay in character, but how have you been?
You can gain one advantage the female gender has but have to give something equivalent in return. What do you do?	Never at fault for anything. I could literally get away with murder. I would trade being treated like an adult for that.	This feels like one of those Twilight Zone episodes about a genie with a twisted sense of irony. "Your wish to have attractive people approach you more often has been granted...but you can never get them to leave you alone! Muahahaha!"
If you saw a woman reading it, what book would make you instantly want to talk to her?	'k, this is gonna make me sound like a cheeseball, but the Bible. It's a good starting point for conversation for me, and some people really love to talk about their spirituality. I could ask 'em about what story they're reading, what church they go to, the whole gamut of small talk. I've actually done that to a few girls that seemed open to conversation. Usually goes well. Jesus is my wingman, broski.	Lolita. Just because, goddammit, that book is just insane, and I've never met anyone I could talk about it with.
Which pant leg does your penis go down?	I'm probably a shower. And I go down the left leg. Right feels uncomfortable. And just straight forward as some people have, yeah my softie can't fit like that :( would be convenient I think.	Grower not a shower. So my boy goes into Travel mode. Real talk. It's actually super convenient. Cause it's like "damn that's a tiny dick" then boom, fucking summer sausage in both length and girth
Men who use dating apps and websites, what’s the most cringeworthy and unattractive bio you’ve seen?	I would say half of the time when a woman has a bio (which is pretty rarely), it is something ridiculous. Hard to choose one.	I've always wondered why women (and I guess some men do it as well) put things like "If you're a cheat or a liar then I'm not interested" As if a cheat or a liar is going to read that and move on to continue his search for a girl who is actively looking for cheats and liars.
What toxic thoughts are you trying to ditch?	I always think I'm being judged for my age or for being liked by my instructors and that people are jealous of me or think I'm a b-word. I just end up as a self-doubting, self-critical mess and I have moments where I hate myself when I can't meet my own unrealistic high standards. I've driven home crying twice in the past three weeks cuz my day wasn't perfect. I cycle between thoughts "I wanna drop out of school" and "Something is wrong with me." Maybe it's actually normal to be this fucked up from high-stress, competitive environments. I hate this though and I'll never be a Type A personality. Whatever. I deal.	Currently in a new relationship (yay!) so I've been having to battle the whole the toxic thought that he might be cheating on me. He hasn't nor do I have any real indication that he would, but in line with this idea of "I'm not worthy". I know if he did do that then it'd be more telling of him than me but I just wrestle with not feeling like I'm worthy of anything so I would take up the blame even though I shouldn't in that case.
Fellow Asian women, to what extent have you been personally impacted by the rise of hate crimes against Asian-X due to the pandemic?	Not at all. I don't leave the house often since we're in lockdown all the time, so the chance of having anybody reacting to me is very slim. I do feel a sense of solidarity with people who have been impacted though. Sometimes friends and acquaintances joke about the Chinese virus and I just tell them that's racist and they stop.	Canadian Chinese. I live in a neighborhood with many Asians. I personally have not been impacted since I work from home. However multiple asian-owned businesses on my block have been broken into multiple times. Unsure if it's racially motivated, and the police were not able to catch the culprits. One restaurant closed as a result.
Women who lift weights regularly and make exercise a habit, do you expect your partner to be the same (ie., a guy who has some level of musculature and is fit)? Or would you date them regardless?	I work out regularly but I do that for me. I enjoy what I see in the mirror and the appreciation on my partner's face. I wouldn't complain if my partner was also active but I love me a nice dad bod. He doesn't have to be cut, so long as he's healthy. And sized right in all the right places haha.	I don’t care if my partner has a 6 pack or not and I don’t expect them too. I just want them to be healthy and take care of their body :)
Older first-time mothers (35+), at what age did you have your first child? What are the challenges and benefits of having children late in life?	"as far as I know my mother didn't have problems conceiving" -- This is such a cop out answer that is included in every other comment. You know most women have a lot of skeletons regarding conception because it is medical and private and sometimes painful! Miscarriages, still births, trouble with birth control, abuse, or abortions. Unless directly asked by my child, if I wanted to keep it private, I would! Most of these comments have very little information.	Age 36. One kid (one and done!). No problems conceiving at all. Kid is perfectly healthy except for the 7-going-on-17 sarcasm in full swing. Plenty of energy to handle a toddler. I didn't have a kid til I was 36 because I wasn't married until age 35.

How do your friendships with your girl friends differ from with your guy friends?	Female friends are women that I want to sleep with or have friends that I want to sleep with. Once I got married my wife replaced every woman out there. You can downvote all you want. But, I never had a female friend that I wouldn't have slept with if she was interested. My wife was an old room mate and best friend of an ex. Basically I was friends with her for years. Then she showed interest and I married her.	Maintaining boundaries is more important with women, lest I accidentally convey romantic interest. I can be more relaxed with men.
What is the dumbest thing your SO has been mad or annoyed at you for?	A few responses from my husband. I got a ticket on my way home from a friends house while he was deployed, I told him and he wrote back "You can even be trusted!" Uh... trusted? With what? Following the rules of the road? Obviously we know that! I got a ticket! Recently he's out to sea again and last week I fell while holding my open new macbook pro, the screen cracked in a few places. "I'm never ever buying you a new laptop ever again. And I'm not paying to get it fixed" :O That was a bit extreme. "Don't feed the cat with those small plates, we use those!" Should I not wash the kitties bowls with the same dish sponge either?	One of my exes got pissed at me for going on vacation with my family for ten days. It was my birthday present and they offered to pay for him and get us our own room and everything, but he said no. He called me and yelled at me several times and finally I broke up with him a week into the trip.
What are some embarrassing, would-be-totally-creepy-if-they-knew things you've done while crushing on someone?	Did bad things to myself while looking at their picture... Looked then up on facebook but I don't add them or anything.	I was friends with her a while back and we had a falling out and recently I've been going back to her tumblr and finding posts that may or may not be about me and trying to decrypt them. It's horrible. I just want her out of my head
Any "right person, wrong time" stories?	I met my boyfriend when I was 14 and he was 17, at the time he had a girlfriend. We clicked right away and became good friends but knew that a couldn't be together because of said other lady. Well to make a long story short, we celebrated our 7 year anniversary yesterday :)	I literally just had the "it's not you, it's bad timing" conversation less than an hour ago. I understand. He has a lot on his plate and more coming his way. I get it. He doesn't want to string me along if he can't be there for me 100%. I truly appreciate his honesty, but.....it hurts Trolls, it fucking hurts.

When you like a girl, what populates your thoughts about her?	I think about sappy couple shit. I'm currently crushing on a girl and I want to invite her over to build pillow forts and watch stupid 80s movies and eat cookies and fall asleep cuddling. I want to go IoA and Disney and parks and have a fairy tale romance. But I am a romantic in a big way about people I genuinely like. I'm getting a steady stream of sex from a FWB so I'm not concerned about sleeping with this girl I like. I'm more interested in the relationship itself.	Along with sex, I romanticize our entire future together. Introducing her to my friends, rainy days at home together, bringing her over for family stuff, fun dates, etc. I really wish I could stop because that just sets a very high expectation that usually lets me down, but I'm a romantic; what can I say?
How old are you and what is your general idea of happiness?	My general outlook on happiness is: Happiness = Reality - Expectations At some point it occurred to me that happiness had less to do with what happened in my life and more to do with how I responded to it internally. Happiness for me has been letting go of expectations and accepting whatever comes my way. As a result, I'm usually happy now.	Turning 22 this week. Direction to be honest. Figuring out what I want to do, figuring who I want to date, Figuring out who I want to be, even if it's some small steps towards progress it gives me happiness
Opinions on Emma Watsons HeForSHe speech?	I don't have any real issue with what she said, but I do wonder why was it needed to be said? The Feminism topic needs to go away, everyone is sick of hearing about it and it has become so skewed by different messages that its basically meaningless. The whole movement is more negative than positive. Her trying to reintroduce people to it is just not necessary. We don't need to hear more about it and it absolutely doesn't need celebrity endorsement. She should be focusing on something more essential, world starvation, spread of AIDS, environmental issues, not third wave feminism in western countries.	I'm not too aware of any places in particular for men to discuss not fitting in with the traditional male stereotypes, but I've not really looked for any. There's certainly not a culture of men discussing problems like this though - traditionally they'd be told to 'man up' or the like which doesn't help anyone. If you look at how statistically males are more likely to commit suicide, there's certainly a basis that men should be able to discuss mental health issues without fear of being stigmatised.
What are the details of couples that you know that show perfect lives on social media, but in their private lives it is a different story?	Couple 1: Lots of couple trips, dinners, fancy drinks, couple selfies. He doesn't go down on her. Couple 2: Trips, dinners, couple selfies, cute posts about eachother. He has ED and last year they didn't have sex at all.	My older sister has this perfect little Facebook Family, but she is the most financially irresponsible human being I have ever met in my life. She'll throw a massive birthday party for her two-year-old that she spent literally thousands of dollars on and hire a professional photographer to document the whole thing and post it all over Facebook to show the world she's the perfect mom, all while she's maxing out her credit cards and overdrafting her bank account every other week.
Ladies, what is the most unusual or interesting job you've had?	I worked in a butcher shop. And not just as some check out girl either! I could cut steaks with the best of them. Had to run a deer through the bandsaw though :(	Right after college, I interned at an exotic cat sanctuary. Lived on-site in the middle of nowhere, butchered beef hearts and chickens in the mornings, and fed them to tigers and bengal hybrids and whatnot with barbecue tongs in the afternoons. Also scooped exotic poop! Now I've shifted lanes and I'm interning as a software engineer for an asteroid mining startup. I've also been a bear builder, zoo educator, and vivarium manager. My resume is a hot mess. EDIT: On my commute home, I realized I forgot about the time I was an assistant to a veterinary dentist!
Do you know when girls have a crush on you and what is giving them away?	I mean is the girl acting in a way that would make you think she was a lesbian if she treated a girl that way? That's only way really	Sometimes. Usually not, but we'll suspect something if she's being unusually friendly or giggly. I usually just assume she's being friendly until she starts dropping sexual references or suggests we do something just the two of us sometime.
How can I help my boyfriend through his body image issues?	Tell him to man the fuck up and keep pumping. He already started working out which is the most important step. Tell him to not look at the mirror/scale but in weekly or by monthly intervals Praise him when you start seeing that his body is actually changing Help him with improving the diet as that will have the largest impact on his routine.	He will only enjoy it by results. Small compliments like "Hmm, you are starting to slim down a little" go a long way. Do stuff like this randomly and not commonly or it will lose value.
Men of Reddit, what can a man do that will cause you to end your friendship with them?	Be flighty or a liar. Be afraid to get in a fight (not be a douchey fight-starter, but afraid to fight at all and actively avoiding it at all cost. I like my friends to have my back if I have theirs). Of course, the fighting part is less valuable the older you get (I haven't been in a proper fight in almost 10 years and I probably never will again), but I feel like fighting is a part of growing up and you are really naive in general if you haven't been in one	Eh I've told this story many times but why not again. Had a really old friend. I got married and had a kid. He got married but got divorced. Had a drinking problem. He moved back to my area and then every time we hung out he would 1) get really, really drunk and annoying and 2) basically just bitch at me about how I'm a bad friend for not hanging out more Finally we got into an argument about this and we stopped talking.
[Serious] I have a Tinder date and I don't even know how to put on a condom. Should I... practice?	1. Yes, practice. Banana first, then you. 2. Don't count on hooking up. 3. Don't even think about hooking up. Just enjoy the date. Treat her like a person first. 4. Get a little flirty to "test the waters". If things go well from there, then it will all happen on it's own. Except the condom part, you still need to put that on manually.	Yes, practicing putting a condom on now means less fumbling later. Also, more importantly, you should learn to distinguish backwards from forwards. If you accidentally start with it backwards, do not turn it around and try to use it. Grab a new condom. Otherwise you've just seeded the tip of your condom with precum.
What made you lose physical attraction to a woman?	* Smashing the homies/Lovin the crew or whatever else they call it these days If she's banged any of my friends it's like EEEUGGGGUUGH! * Belly overhang. Hiding them with spanx upsets me. The bikini area is a triangle. If my eyes are on the same plane as her belly button and I can't see the top of that triangle, it's a turn off. You don't have to calculate my hypotenuse. I don't want to have to calculate yours * Turning me down for sex and not initiating after. Rejection fucking hurts.	I was in a relationship with her, it had been a long term relationship. She was unfaithful while I was visiting my family abroad, a trip she refused to join me on. I couldn't look at her again, the thought of the other guy in her just turned my stomach.
How often do you swap for a clean towel for showering and why?	Every day. I never knew there's people who use the same towel for days on end. Seems absolutely disgusting to me.	I use one for my hair and one for my body and wash them every week with my sheets. I only wash my hair like once or twice a week, but take showers more often to at least like rinse off any sweat, shave, etc.
Those who have ended a close friendship, what's the story behind it? Was it a difficult decision for you?	She came to visit after I had lost a lot of weight due to an eating disorder. She expressed shock, worry, and anger, which I understood. What I didn't understand was the cops showing up at my door later that day for a wellness check. She had lied to them to get them to come out and "scare me straight". Possibly even hoping they would cart me off to a mental hospital. It was so violating.	She got depressed and stopped talking to me. I would always talk to her like normal and invite her to do stuff which she would always say no to. I didn't mind because she was depressed, until I saw she was always talking to her other friends and going out with them all the time when she said she was going to be in bed (who also happen to be people who hate me for a misunderstanding I could never clear up) and I was like "well fuck you then".
What was your most humiliating hook up experience?	I was 17. Got drunk with this girl and her cute friend. Had them come over, and the cute friend was wayy to drunk she passed out on my floor. So it was me and my friend who i should mention, was going through a buzzed head lesbian phase. She was on the bigger side too. Im tall and skinny af. I climbed up on that and smashed it. I regretted it. But she was a cool girl i was just drunk as fuck. I tell people to this day im like remember when whats her face shaved her head and dyed it blonde? I took her down. Conqured that belly.	My first kiss. I stopped the car in front of her house, leaned over to kiss her. I realize the car is moving and we slam into the back of her dad's truck and her head hits the dash **HARD**. She had to get stitches and I got it bad from her Dad. &#x200B; Shoulda parked.
How do you feel about "adult only" places or events, like condos, wedding, etc.?	I've gotten two wedding invitations recently that noted "adult reception." I don't have children, and I've never been married, so I'm speaking as a single, childless person. I think it's weird. When people get married, don't they want to celebrate with their family? Don't families have kids? I don't understand why people would want to exclude children from the festivities, and additionally, put that much more pressure on guests to find someone to watch their children. If I were to ever get married, I would probably hire some people to help out at the ceremony as "baby sitters." That way, children can come but parents can let lose as well. Maybe it wouldn't work, just an idea.	I went on holiday to an adult only resort in Cancun and it was absolute bliss. This may be partly because I'm a teacher so it was nice to get a proper break from children.
What do you consider "leading you on"?	When she sends you chocolate covered strawberries on Valentines Day but wont go out to dinner with you what a slut.	In college I asked a girl out, she said yes but she was busy that weekend. I tried to reschedule the next friday and the next saturday. After so many "I'm busy now how bout later?" I just told her that the ball was in her court. That was 100% leading me on. I liked her, she seemed to like me. She was super flirty even when cancelling and 'rescheduling'. Just made me feel like crap.
What's the most awkward conversation you've had with your parents?	My mum decided to tell me about her menstrual cycle throughout her life and then how manapause effected her. Awkies	My mother once asked me to get her weed because she wanted to try it. I didn't smoke weed though. So many awkward questions in my mind that day.
Is anyone else sad about the cruel jokes about Kim Kardashian?	No. Not as it pertains to her anyway. When people are rude to everyday normal pregnant women? Yes. But I couldn't give two shits about someone whose entire fortune is based off putting herself in the public eye in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY IMAGINABLE.	I think on the one hand, fat shaming a pregnant woman is really cruel. *But on the other hand*, this is a woman who exists in the public eye, and part of her persona (which she's specifically curated) is being glamorous and fashionable. And holy shit her pregnancy clothes are fugly. Like, really terribly unflattering. So I don't think "Hahaha, Kim is fat" is okay, but I do think "Jesus what the fuck brown monstrosity is she wearing?!" is fair game.
What do you guys do after work?	I drink, smoke pot, watch porno, feed the cats, eat some toast, and maybe get some hours in on a hobby or video game.	I (29M) recently got into cooking. I finish work by 4, then head to the store to buy groceries for whatever I want to cook that night. It's a good hobby to develop. I'm not a good cook by any means, but getting better and eating healthier. I try to have food ready by the time my wife is home from work. The big hurdle is finding recipes that work for you. Stuffed Bell Peppers are simple, delicious, and make convenient leftovers that are easy to re-heat.
Women who have had an abortion...what's something you wish you would've known beforehand?	I was gonna abort but I went to abortion counselling first. After that I felt I was more informed about pregnancy so I felt more confident about keeping the baby. I am grateful for having my son now. Without the counselling I would have gone straight to abortion without any hesitation. So I think many girls who are not sure- maybe hearing it from both sides will help you make an informed decision.	How much better I would feel immediately afterwards and how much worse people would make me feel about it later on. No regrets though!
What makes you feel the most capable and masculine?	OP I agree. Men are being destroyed with all the bullshit and that is what is. Men have become afraid to be themselves and that is a form of rape in my opinion. All the TV shows are about men being idiots and complete wimps, commercials are always making fun of you, it's pathetic and it's ruining the men who are growing up now. (guys upvote this the woman are going to nail me)	When my girlfriend puts her head on my chest and I put my arm around her. Makes me feel like the strongest shield in the world
My loved girlfriend of 10 years died suddenly. I am totally wasted. How to cope with all this?	I call bullshit. This sounds like you just made this up. When I read the part about the cherry blossoms in Japan I just knew. Pretty cool you convinced all these suckers.	I can't even imagine the pain you must be going through right now and my sincere internet hugs to you. To answer your question, reddit is not the place where you'll find help with how to cope with this. Look for professional help, a good therapist will be able to help you get your life back on track. For now, just remember it's fine to feel terrible, she was a huge part of your life and don't let anyone decide when you're "over her death", you're the only one who can decide that.
What’s something you dislike about Hollywood movies today?	Franchises. I only want the Disney Marvel Franchise. The star wars continuation movies suck so hard with the exception of Rogue One, which was made as a standalone. Every other franchise movie can burn in Hollywood hell	I'm sure this is a popular opinion but I'm tired of how so many Hollywood films now are remakes and sequels.
Can we talk about not washing hair?	Wouldn't even try it. I get sweaty for fun, and that leads to gross hair, so it gets washed very regularly.	My sister and I have both tried the no poo method and we have super oily hair like yours. The difference is that we have thick hair, but that should make it more magical right? Yeah it never became magical for us and we just had greasy hair for a month. This no-poo method is not a magical method for all hair types - some of us need a good washing! I did find a shampoo at lush that allows me to go every other day without washing because it works great for oily hair.
Has there ever been something in a relationship you thought you could get over but ultimately couldn't?	Our age difference. I'm seven months older than my boyfriend and it really bothers me because I've always imagined myself with someone years older than me.	Social media was a big thing for me too. He posted his every move on facebook except for when he was with me. I just left it alone because I don't post much but I commented on one of his pictures and my comment disappeared. I asked him what happened and he played dumb, so I posted something on his wall just to see what would happen and he immediately deleted it. I asked why he seemed to be so ashamed of me and he said I was trying too hard, I broke it off there. I found out later that he was in relationships with multiple women at once, it was a giant shit show.
Fellas with names that are traditionally female, did your parent ever tell you why they gave it to you?	My dad left me and my mom when I was born, right after I was named. I finally met him some years later and asked him why he named me Sue, he said this world is rough and if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough. He wouldn't be there to help me along, so he gave me that name and said goodbye, he knew I'd have to get tough or die, or that AskMen should consider adding a serious tag option when posting.	My ex's parents thought they couldn't have kids, so they adopted two kids who happened to come from Korea, they gave them Western names, then my ex was born, so to "even" things out they gave him a traditionally Korean name, which is a female name in the Western world. His parents were awesome, they later adoped their friends son after she passed away, the kid was black and a bit of a trouble maker, he kicked his football into the neighbours garden and messed up some flowers, the neighbour called up the parents to complain and said *"Your coloured son ruined my flowers"*, ex's dad replied *"You'll have to be more specific about which colour, I have one black, two yellow and one white."*
What justice was served to one of your exes that you didn't intentionally serve yourself?	early 2000s ex wife cheated on me and ended up leaving me for him. Well about 8 months later she breaks up with new guy and he is upset about it. So he plasters her naked pictures all over the internet and makes sure that her name is on it for everyone to see.	She never officially broke up with me, started dating another person, and acted completely cold and distant when we finally talked it out. She got an ugly haircut and looks like shit. Petty? Oh Yeah. But now *I'm the cute one*.
What's something you splurged for on your wedding day but later realized it was a waste of money/time/effort?	Thanks for your feedback, ladies! :) All I really want to do is have the immediate families have supper after the ceremony & have everyone else (friends, extended family) come later on for the party/celebration.	I had a smallish surprise wedding (it was a New Year's party and we had a quick ceremony in the middle). I spent a couple weeks before hand decorating champagne flutes, I had 50 I think. I painted them with gold glitter so that it was like an ombre coming up from the bottom, very pretty. I intended for people to use them and then bring them home as favors, but basically no one did and now I have a box of champagne flutes in my garage I'll never use. I wish I hadn't bothered, or at least I wish I hadn't worried so much about that stuff. It really didn't matter in the end.
Reddit Women! Unmarried man[37] will be having his daughter[16] stay with him for a while. The catch is, we haven't seen each other since she was 5. Bonding suggestions?	um instead of setting out to bond...just try to hang out. She is a grown up at this point, at least in her own mind, if you treat her that way she will appreciate it. Feel free to have open adult conversations with her that are full of truth without casting aspersions or blame. She will have questions, try to answer them. Let her know that her family was under a lot of stressors and did the best they could under the circumstances to do what was best for her and for themselves.	Don't mention the aunt's involvement. Just say that the lawyer told you they had reason to believe the test wasn't accurate so you were asked to do a new one. All those years you were gone were because her mom said you were not her father and asked you to bow out of their lives. DNA backed her up (although you now know it was inaccurate) so you did as she asked believing it was in their best interests.
Guys who have dated someone who you weren't fully physically attracted to...how did it affect your relationship, and how did your attraction to them develop over time?	Erectile disfunction. Cheated on her. Made her dress up in specific outfits, but that’s a thing anyway. Frankly, I’ve dated uglier girls that I like personally and thus found beautiful. Men see beauty where we want to.	Felt like I was just going through the motions and dating just to be dating. Looks aren't the most important aspect of relationships but there has to be a level of physical attraction that draws you to the girl. Without the sexual attraction, what you've really got is just a friendship.
What was the last new-to-you food that you tried that you thought was heavenly?	Sounds so stupid but sour cream. The idea of it always grossed me out so I refused to try it. Then I ordered nachos once and forgot to tell them to leave it off and didn’t want to waste the food.. now I eat it on everything.	I just made and tried creme Brûlée for a friends birthday this weekend. Holy god. Imma have to make many more.
What do you find to be some common misconceptions among women about what guys want?	1) My girlfriend seems convinced that deep down, I want to be emotional, share my feelings, and be validated, but I'm held back by a society that teaches me to hide it all away. Uhh...nope. I just wanna watch the game, eat some good food, and fuck. I don't have the feels about almost anything. 2) Women in general seem to think that men care a lot about accessories, shoes that match clothes, fancy hair, and crap like that. Uhh...nope. We want you to work out and be fit, dress to show off your hot body, and use tasteful, natural makeup. That's really all there is to it. For me at least.	> you can never text him first This is terrible advice. If she never texts me first, I assume she's not interested and fade out.
I just got a raise at work, and I'm going on a date tonight. What's going good in your life?	Got the entry level job that will lead into what I actually want to do in life. Bit of a pay hit from what I was doing. But, like I said, It's where I want to go.	My puppy hasn't pooped in his kennel overnight in more than a week, I got married to an amazing woman on Monday, and my job just put me (and only me) in charge of our new 3D printer.
How do you choose to live your life differently than your parents?	By traveling! As much and as often as I can. My mom has started to come with me now that she is retired, which is awesome. My father doesn’t like to be more than 50 miles from home. And on another note, there are ways I wish I could be MORE like my parents - I hugely admire their patience, dedication, and how little they judge others.	I don't leave the wet sponge I used to wash the dishes in the sink sopping wet, because that's gross, mom! Wring. It. Out. That's how you get mold!
"What is wrong?" "Nothing." Where does this stereotype come from?	It comes from reality. I've had this exact conversation with almost every single woman I have dated. Now, what are the root causes? As some have mentioned, it may stem from the idea that women are too emotional and should stop being that way. Another explanation is that they are looking to avoid confrontation. Another explanation is that the woman has not completely formulated what she wants to say, so this is a stalling mechanism. In my experience, this has usually been the case.	I say it when I don't think I'm justified in feeling a certain way. I'm afraid of making mountains out of molehills and starting something that doesn't need to be started. It's physically difficult for me to say anything when I feel like that. Like I want to say it, but my mouth won't move. But then my boyfriend will say something like, "I like to think I can tell you anything. And I want you to feel the same." And then I eventually open up.
Women who have taken a guy's virginity, Could you tell and did they tell you?	My boyfriend and I took each other's virginities and we both knew the other was a virgin. It was cute because he was very nervous and had a hard time getting it up and it just made it worse when I screamed in pain when he tried to get in (I told him to go slow! xD). Then when he did get in he kinda humped but didn't really know to go in and out, and then he lost it again within a couple minutes. We had the courage to try again later that day and it was a lot better. It may not have been the best first time but I thought it was really adorable that he had no idea what to do and it was really special because I got to share it with the person I am going to spend my life with.	I took my husband's virginity. He told me before hand. He had some issues at first getting too nervous to perform, but we worked through his issues together. The only reason I could tell was that he had some issues staying hard in the beginning, but, once we got going, I couldn't tell he was a virgin at all! Gentlemen out there, don't be afraid to be honest with a girl about your virginity. If she is bothered by you being a virgin, then she isn't worth giving your V-card to.
How to tell my girlfriend I'm worried about her getting fat in the future without coming off as an arse?	> She'd run and used to be on various volleyball teams. Unfortunately due to work and a shitton of stress, those activities had to be put aside Also, she's now in a relationship, she can let herself go.	You can just say that you're worried about her health because all she eats is fast food. Fat or not, that kind of diet is just not good for you. If you make it about her getting fat and unattractive to you, that's what makes you an asshole. But at the end of the day, you can't force her to change. If she doesn't want to work out and doesn't want to eat better food, well, that's her decision.
How do you feel about the "Me Too" posts trending on social media?	I wrote and posted the following in response on my Facebook this morning. It is the sum of my feelings about it. Feel free to take and repost: "Everyone knows that women are sexually harassed and assaulted. Women aren't the ones who need to come out of the shadows on this issue. Men are. And by shining the light on women and celebrating their fight, we make it safe for the male perpetrators to remain in the shadows. How about the men who are responsible start standing up and identifying themselves by posting "I did". Copy and paste this to see if anyone you know is brave enough to come into the light to stop sexual assault."	I question my own experiences compared with other women... I guess I don't know if my experiences are "enough" to speak on publicly. I have never been assaulted but of course have experienced instances of leering glances and catcalling. I guess I feel as though my participation would trivialize the posts of others who have faced so much more, so I am uncomfortable participating.
What's your funniest sex story?	Ended up cumming in her eye, when she screamed something like "YOU FUCKING CAME IN MY EYE" I dipped my finger in a puddle and replied with "yes I did Simba" as I did the simba thing.	My SO and I were making out, things are clearly heading toward intercourse. I am pulling her panties off and she starts talking about her IUD. How she has had some cramping but not too much, how she can 'feel it in there' when she moves a certain way... We have been together for a long time, so NBD, we share everything even if this is a weird time for it. Then, I am like sucking her tits when she mentions how she has noticed more discharge lately from the IUD, so I whisper in her ear, "hnng tell me about that discharge again." She starts cracking up and realizes how insane her chatter has been. Then we banged or whatever.
Is it a red flag knowing that your current SO has been known to typically dates douche bags?	I would dump her, but I'm an asshole. Don't listen to me. Listen to other people. ... I'm not sure why I'm even posting this	Yes, but not for the reasons you expect. I've got an adage here, it's never been wrong. "If she calls all of her exes crazy, abusive, or douchebags, be prepared to be called a crazy abusive douchebag after you break up." It is *exceedingly* rare for one side of a relationship to be the sole cause of an issue. Anyone that plays the victim in all of theirs is probably using it to avoid their share of the blame. The guy version of this is "all of my exes are psychotic bitches". Well, yeah, when you keep cheating on them that tends to happen.
What are your gym annoyances/pet peeves?	Not gym, but I've recently taken up just jogging around my neighborhood early in the morning. I do this specifically because I want to greatly minimize the chance that someone will actually see me running. So my greatest annoyance is running into the guy who just HAS to walk his dogs at 5:30 in the morning. Not to sound arrogant but I can't help but feel like he's watching my ass as I jog past. Ugh.	When the machine I'm using starts making really loud squeaky noises. Most people have headphones in, but occasionally someone doesn't, and then I feel bad :(
What's the cringiest moment you have witnessed?	14yo I barely knew because she tried to register to my adult-only class, offered me sex in a back corridor. Her friends and general passerbys were in sight by just popping the head to the angle. Soooooo, how do I minimize the chances I'll be in jail now? Can I salvage some sort of social life?	A guy we partied with as kids started crying one night asking a girl to fuck him. This went on for like an hour until he blacked out. She kept telling him that she just wasn't up for sex that night but had tried to drunkenly make out with several of us before that. Later, I walked in on her fucking the guy my friend brought with him. Bonus cringe-I took a shitty job in my hometown years later and that girl's dad was my boss. He would always introduce me to people telling them I used to hang out with his baby girl.
What items do you own that are better suited to a different life?	Sometimes it seems like all my really feminine clothing should belong to someone else. Other times my baggy jeans and t-shirts feel the same way. I think I'm having some gender issues right now... :(	I have this very unflattering but super comfy tunic length sweater. It has a kangaroo pouch and makes me look pregnant, but it's kind of casual and adorable in a weird way. I bought it because it would be the perfect thing to wear while cuddling with my boyfriend on the couch and watching TV. You know, if I had a boyfriend. Or a couch. Or a TV.
Women who joined Reddit many years ago: Have you noticed an increase or decrease in misogyny throughout the default subreddits? Has Reddit's attitude towards women changed?	I wonder if anyone is this thread has any statistics to back up claims of misogyny. This thread is just how you feel about this site which isn't evidence of an increase of sexism. If anyone has anything like trending data that would be interesting to see.	Four years ago women were invisible, so misogyny didn't come up very often in threads. I think it's been on the rise just because there are more outlets for peoples hate.
To women that always wanted to change their bodies by eating well and working out but never had the discipline ... BUT then finally did it... how did you get yourself to finally have the discipline to do it?	Sorry I'm late to the party but for me I needed to get below 32% bmi to have a chance at making 10 grand. I'm trying to do medical studies which pay a great deal. Money is always a great motivator!	By being realistic! What I mean by that is I see that I have many commitments (work, family, etc) so I don't put pressure on myself to get to the gym 5 days a week. Instead I pick one day and the other days I do at home workouts because that's what makes sense with my schedule. I also don't keep junk food in the house. If I don't have it I can't eat it and then if I do go out to eat I don't feel bad putting something that isn't healthy into my body. It feels like a treat.
If you had to pick between having a girlfriend, but no friends or having no girlfriend, but really good male friends that you could hangout with, grab a beer etc. Which one would you pick?	Both are catch22 in my opinion. I love my girlfriend like crazy, she's awesome. But I also enjoy male camaraderie, sometimes women don't get fart jokes or why Fury Road is one of the greatest movies ever.	The girlfriend with no friends, because that's pretty much how my life has been since I moved to the UK. No regrets though, I love my wife immensely.
Has anyone long-term dated or married an SO that was less motivated/ ambitious/successful than you? How did it turn out?	Poorly, because his laziness drove me up a wall. He had "absolutely no idea" why his teachers hated him (he was a failed class clown), claimed they "gave him bad grades on purpose" (hint: that's not how it works) and that he just "couldn't get good grades" but he also "wasn't stupid". I told him very explicitly that I wasn't going to marry someone who had no chance of success or goals in life. He took it about as well as he could.	My husband is very much the laid-back, low-key compliment to my type-A ambition. That's not to say he doesn't have ambitions; he has a lot of things that he works toward that are important to him, but they aren't money-making or prestige driven. It took him a while to find the things that were important to him. We've been married for about three years and lived together for seven-ish before that. It's working out great for us. He has a freelance writing career and does some odd jobs and pursues his interests; I work in a career I love. I am the breadwinner, but he takes care of the house, makes me dinner and lunches to take to work and just generally takes care of me. I love it.
Why do girls treat guys better if he is with another girl?	My wife says that women are naturally "catty" with other women, so when there is a male involved they use him as a "buffer" to play the situation out till both women are comfortable with eachother.	Pre-selection. The fact that you've been "accepted" (they don't know she's your sister) by other women can make a woman see you in a better light. Many married men can tell you how their ring can get many women going, and it's not because of some specific will to break up a relationship. Men with ample options with women, men with success with women, even men who just give off the vibe of success, they're simply the ones who'll be particularly attractive to other women. Extra edit: this isn't only sexual, either.
What ended up being a deal breaker in your relationship that you didn't think would bother you at the start?	Having a cat. I am very allergic, and don't like them. I thought I could deal, it was his pet. Total nightmare. That cat was the root of so many problems.	His critical nature. I didn't think anything of it at first, because it was always directed at other things (movies, other people's houses, books, etc.). But then, when I became the target .... wow, that was not ok.
What do you do at the gym if you've never been before?	The gym is not required. r/bodyweightfitness Most people quit working out because they don't have time. The time you spent driving to the gym could be enough to complete a workout.	Hey, man. One thing to realize is that everyone goes through a sort of "fitness journey" where you try out different things and you learn how to work your body. Many people go to the gym for months or even years before they "get it" so don't worry about perfection at first. Good luck!
Sweaty/stinky women of reddit, what is your holy grail antiperspirant + deodorant?	I don't use antiperspirant because it's not that great for you. Deodorant wise I use a men's old spice with deodorant only. They have some that include antiperspirant but I avoid those. The fiji scent is pretty nice and they have other scents that aren't to "manly." Sometimes I have to get it online because a lot of stores only carry ones with antiperspirant.	Mitchum. I’ve been using it since I was 13. 31 now. I have used Dove, Secret, Degree, Toms (ugh I hate this one), Speed Stick whenever I had wanted to try something new & I always go back to Mitchum. It’s just a clean scent & I never feel like I need to reapply.
College Dropouts, how are you doing now?	I’m not a man, but I’ll write about two men in my life. One of them was a hard partier and had LOTS of friends. Some of them were in university and when they graduated he hit a spiral because their lives went in a different direction. His family rallied. He pulled himself together and now, even without a degree, he is financially independent, living in an expensive city, has a flourishing social life and is building his future. He’s very smart and resourceful so that helps immensely. The other man is my husband. He’s the kinda guy who has to always have a full-time job so he did university part-time in his twenties and thirties. He’s a manager and he needs to have a degree in his field. Doing his degree part-time was hard but worth it.	Watch out for survivor bias here. A lot of college dropouts who are likely not doing so great won't be commenting.
Farted too loud. What are the dumbest fights you've gotten into with your S/O?	Uh. Black people get preferential treatment getting into college. I'm not black. She's not black. Actually, neither of us are white. What the fuck?!	My ex went nuts because I wanted to sleep on the left side of the bed...in my own house. She literally had a temper tantrum and threatened to sleep on the couch or go home. We are no longer together.
Who are your favorite influential women & why?	Hillary Clinton. She's been working to improve lives since her twenties and hasn't stopped. I will stan for her until the day I die.	Carrie Fisher. She was a mental health advocate, an incredible outspoken woman, and absolutely earned her place as the face the rebellion with her post- Star Wars work. She had great things to say about the Slave Girl Leia outfit or whatever it's called, and what to tell kids about it - "Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn't like it. And then I took it off. Backstage." Ruth Bader Ginsburg - because she is a national treasure. A good quote from her: "I’m sometimes asked when will there be enough [women on the supreme court] And I say ‘When there are nine.’ People are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that."
What relationship/dating mistake did you make when you were younger that you think about now and cringe?	Not sure if this counts, but when your primary material for constant tomfoolery is exaggerated datelessness, insanity and intoxication, it makes other people justifiably reluctant to be in intimate situations with you. edit: In my defense, people did laugh. Most of the time.	I dropped $6k (all my tip money from 2 years of busting my balls) on two days of the "perfect" Manhattan experience. Wine and dined her. Sexy loft overseeing SOHO. Shopping spree. Showed her all over. Found out on the last day she was texting her abusive ex boyfriend the whole time. Flew back home sobbing for my heart and wallet.
What is a physical trait a lot of women consider as a bad thing on women that you see as a good thing?	Moustaches. I cbf doing anything with mine and it always makes me happy to find a fellow can't-be-fucked-eradicating-my-mousy type woman. Also knuckle hair. I love my knuckle hair and I think it's cute on everyone.	Freckles! Loads of people seem to think freckles are super ugly and I'm like..huh!? They also make for super awesome portraits!
How often should you really shower?	LOL the no-shower, no-shampoo movement trending lately is one of my biggest pet peeves! Everyone has a different activity level and some live in warmer climates with more humidity, which just necessitates more frequent showering, period. I work out in the morning (HIIT) and take a full shower before work, and usually will rinse just my body before bed to freshen up. It annoys me so much when people gasp and say “omg washing your hair every day is soooo bad for it!!” when they’re the usually the ones who flat iron daily and color their hair, while I never color or heat style mine. You go ahead and fry your hair and feel better about it by showering once a week if you want, just leave my healthy, soft, nice smelling hair and skin alone, thanks.	As often as you need/want to. Some people get dry skin if they shower too much, while other people are perfectly fine showering twice a day. Some people like to wash their hair every time they shower, while other people only wash their hair once a week or less. There's no right or wrong way to do it, as long as you don't stink.
How did you choose your major in college?	Looked through all the majors the school was offering and chose the one that made me go "yep that sounds easy"	Looked into which majors led to the best careers and which majors would be the best fit for me academically. I choose finance.
Guys with lots of female friend, what is your advice in not getting friendzoned all the time?	If you consider it “the friend zone”, then they’re not friends to you, they’re just potential hook-ups. Be honest with yourself, with us, and with them. Being friends with people means you’re satisfied with being friends. I’ve lots of female friends with whom I share purely platonic friendships. They’re awesome. I’ve got a couple of fwbs. Also cool. I’ve got a partner. She’s baller too. All of these are people I’d be friends with, regardless of sex.	I have lots of female friends, but I've always been genuinely friends with all of them. I'm not hoping I'll eventually get to date one. If I were to meet a new girl and be interested in being more than friends with her, I'd be a lot more flirty and make that clear. It's not really relevant to me now, as I'm married, but I would say the female friends thing helps because you are way more comfortable and natural interacting with women, you get the social validation, and they'll help you meet more people.
What's your "WTF, I thought stuff like this only happened in movies" moment?	Tbh, I don't talk about those moments because I get called a liar. Truth is just stranger than fiction more often than one would think.	In a 15 mile stretch of freeway, in the middle of the night, I blew 2 tires and my fuel pump completely went out, stranding me on I-15 somewhere in Wyoming. (This did not all happen at once...first one tire, a few miles later the other tire, and then the fuel pump. On a 3 year old car with just 40,000 miles) Edit: Also, forgot to add, after the first blown tire, a small group of bikers pulled up and stayed with me until my roadside assistance showed up (even though it took over an hour), because they said it wasn't safe for me all alone. Nicest group of people I've ever come across.
Hey on account of Freud's birthday, do you think there is any similarity between your SO and your father?	Okay bare with me I'm in an open relationship. My husband is the opposite of my father. He is naturally submissive, very thoughtful, a helper, and likes to spend lots of quality time together. My boyfriend is just like my father. I have a lot of fun with him, he is logical like me (i take after my father), he is frugal, a problem solver, he is charming and a natural leader. I joke that he and I would take over the world in 1 week's time. I get to see both sides of the coin. I really love and adore the qualities my boyfriend has I think my husband compliments me in different ways. I understand why I am attracted to the qualities my boyfriend has but I also understand why my husband is a great match for me.	They both own the same awful looking "white people tourist hiker" hat to keep the sun off your head and neck while still being lightweight and breathable.
What is the rudest/most unprofessional thing that has happened to you in an interview?	So, I haven't had anything bad happen to me and usually avoid answering as I'm not a woman. However my SO has had some Awful interviews. The worst was someone called her asking about an interview. He said to meet in the pub 'the red lion' Now my SO had been out of work for a while, and figured it would be for a waitress or bartender at the red lion. She gets there. and nope. someone hiring strippers, pretending to be the pub on websites, and just meeting them there with a drink. Then proceeded to tell her she could be an escort but she was to fat to be a stripper.	A few years ago, I spent an hour at a coffee shop consulting with a potential client for a photography job. She wanted her fashion line photographed editorial style. It was a pretty intense gig and involved a lot of hours and commercial use licensing. Went over business plans, locations, potential models, etc. At the end of the "interview" she says to me, "So, I have this thing where I don't pay people the first time they work for me.. But this will be great exposure for you!" Completely wasted my time and hers. For the sake of context, the words, "I can't pay, but it will be good exposure for you," are some of the most disrespectful words you can say to someone in the art world.
I just trusted a fart I shouldn't have. Ladies, what has been your most recent mistake?	I'm in NYC and I went to get a pedicure. I instinctively turned on the shitty massage chair and they apparently charge for it. Not a huge fail, but really?	I'm pretty much a failure at most things. This month I put my hand in hot tea instead of the pringles can, accidentally punched my boss in the face while stretching, have banged my shin enough times that I can't really wear shorts, dropped a bodywash container on my little toe, modified a base file on a server at work instead of my private copy and didn't realize until people were saying theirs wasn't working (snuck back into the file and fixed it), deleted the name of a public file and had no idea what it was called so had to leave it named "I'm Sorry".... And I'm only halfway through the month!
How do you feel when men make jokes on periods or women being unable to drive?	Good morning Before you post in this thread, ask yourself if you're making a hackneyed misogynistic joke. If the answer is "yes," or if you think your "joke" could be perceived as such, kindly press cancel and move on. You're not original, clever, or amusing. Your comment will just get removed, and additional action may be taken for repeat or particularly egregious offenders. Thank you.

What slightly embarrassing thing have you done at work lately?	Saw an older (very well paid) coworker wearing flipflops in the hallway, so I went in to HR asking if flip flops were appropriate attire at work (don't really care, just can't stand the guy). HR lady was wearing flipflops... I'll just go back to my desk...	I work at a library. My focus is youth services. I REALLY try to learn all of the kids names. We are part of a small community and I want them to feel as welcome as possible. I welcomed a kid, thought I knew his name. He responded with "I'm not ______. That's the other black kid."
What is the absolute worst thing a therapist told their client?	Marriage counsellor. Told my wife her behaviours are fine and don’t need to change despite being the most critical and negative person I know. Counsellors are not supposed to give opinions just help you to talk. Thanks a bunch.	The practice I used to work at had a patient with severe PTSD from his time in combat. He overheard his therapist telling her office assistant that he was "crazy." It broke my heart.
How much did your college grades matter to where you are now in your job? What is your job?	It matters a LOT for the first job. Many companies in my profession, Software Engineering, won't even look at you if your college GPA isn't 3.5 or up. Once you're no longer a New College Hire though, it doesn't matter much at all.	I'm a software engineer and I literally did not include my GPA on the resume that I used when I applied towards the end of my last year. I was never asked about it either. Honestly I don't even know my final GPA
Women of reddit, what are some of your tips to a fellow lady who's got no game when it comes to attracting a partner?	My attractiveness varies enormously depending on how I'm dressed, and that includes makeup. I'm basing this on men's reactions to me. \-Wear makeup (eyeliner, mascara, undereye concealer, a little blush, and a subtle lipstick) \-Wear your hair down and styled. If you're a model, you might look hot in a ponytail, but I don't think most of us do. \-Wear an outfit that shows the general shape of your body, maybe with a tight waist. Nothing too baggy. You don't have to show cleavage AT ALL - and in general that's kind of a trashy look, so I'd avoid that. \-Heels matter a TON. I wish they didn't, but they really really do. \-SMILE!	I ALWAYS make the first move, I’m not going to wait for them to get off their asses. What I do is start with subtle/not subtle at all flirty looks, then I start getting subtly (not really) closer to them, if they receive this well starting conversation is easy.
If you were given the offer to restart your life since childhood with all the knowledge that you currently have to change things, would you accept it? Why or why not?	Not a chance... I may be able to change my own circumstances, but I could not stop people from disregarding each other, valuing profit over our environment and just been down right self-serving ass holes to one another. Humanities motto, 'Bless me, fuck everyone'. I will not suffer stupid people any longer than I have to.	Fucking absolutely. * I'd be a lot more assertive in school, in terms of relationships. I still might not have gotten one, but I'd have a better chance. * I would have spent a lot more time with my dad. I Miss him every day. * I would have bought as much bitcoin I could when it was 6 cents in 2011, and I would have sold when it was $19,000 in December 2017. I'd be a billionaire today.
What sexual information regarding the intimacy of you and your s/o would you consider too far over the line to share with your girlfriends?	My BFF of 20 years both acknowledge that we each enjoy sex with our partners, but we don't divulge a lot of details. When we were both younger and dating different guys, we both had more horrible, funny, embarrassing things to share so we talked in a little bit more detail. It's different now. She's known my husband for 15, and I've known hers for 10. When I lost my virginity at age 19, she was the first person I told. When she dated a guy with a micropenis, I heard all about it. Sex with long term partners isn't quite as amusing as all the shit we used to see as single ladies. When we do talk about sex, we laugh about all of the old stuff.	Anything specifically about him rather than me. So, "we tried X and I loved/hated it!" is fair game, my girls and I are very open about our experiences. But if I was to say anything about *his* preferences, or things he isn't willing to try, or describe his body (intimately, not just general physique), well...to me, that's crossing the line. I'm the only one who should know those details unless he chooses to share! (Mind you, I'd discussed this with my SO at the time, so he knew we were so open and was okay with it, even if he didn't quite understand why.)
Women who have taken self defense classes, how effective were they in real life situations (if you encountered one)?	It wasn't. Self defense classes deal with the stranger in the bushes type scenarios, which are exceedingly rare. It didn't deal with the subway car so crowded that you can't really move, or the friend who tries to take advantage of how drunk you are, etc.	I haven't needed to defend myself since taking the class, but the knife disarm was great for getting the TV remote away from someone because *no I am not watching "How It's Made: Tractor Edition" again goddamit.*
What is one shocking thing you've learned about your SO since you've been with them?	He sometimes likes to paint his toenails (but makes sure no body except for me sees it). It's not about being transsexual or anything, it's just.. maybe the idea that nobody knows it? Having a secret? Also, he is also always worrying about his hair not being modeled he way he likes it. Ok, these two things combined do make him sound a bit gay, but he really isn't! He just cares about his hair, haha!	One day I came home and heard what sounded like silverware clinking in the bathroom. I opened the door, only to find him eating a bowl of cereal while on the toilet pooping. He expressed no shame and simply told me he does it regularly because it's "efficient."
Is there anyone here who would say they are NOT ambitious?	Female here! I looked at the thread and a few comments, and based on a cursory glance, I don't think you lack ambition. Sure, you don't really want to move up the corporate ladder, but you've already secured a white collar job with a comfortable salary. When the women on the other thread talk about "lacking ambition", they seem to be talking about guys who work part-time on minimum wage, who are content to deliver pizza and smoke pot all day. Yes, you go to work and play video games and whatever, but I think what separates you and those guys is the job you already occupy.	Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. Fortunately, I also lack any ambition towards relationships, so it doesn't matter to me if other people find me boring.
Why is the idea that a woman can easily find a boyfriend/significant other/partner so prevalent on Reddit?	Because when we say that women have an easier time getting a man it means that women have easier access to sex. If a man were to ask a room full of women if any of them want to have sex with him all of them would say no. If a woman were to ask a room full of men if any of them want to have sex with her, at least one of them will say yes.	I think the men who say this are defining "women" as "women I want to date." And they might also be defining "can easily find" as "I, personally, know right where it is." So when they say "Women can easily find a boyfriend", they're really saying "I know exactly where to find a guy who is willing to date the women I want to date!"
What's your favourite poem?	I can see what you see not—Vision milky, then eyes rot.Then you see what cannot be—Shadows move where light should be. Out of darkness, out of mind, cast down into the Halls of the Blind.	For Jane: With All The Love I Had, Which Was Not Enough - Charles Bukowski I pick up the skirt, I pick up the sparkling beads in black, this thing that moved once around flesh, and I call God a liar, I say anything that moved like that or knew my name could never die in the common verity of dying, and I pick up her lovely dress, all her loveliness gone, and I speak to all the gods, Jewish gods, Christ-gods, chips of blinking things, idols, pills, bread, fathoms, risks, knowledgeable surrender, rats in the gravy of two gone quite mad without a chance, hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance, I lean upon this, I lean on all of this and I know her dress upon my arm but they will not give her back to me.

What TV Shows are everyone currently watching and how are they so far?	I’m switching between bloodline and agent carter. I’m on the last season of both. I wish there were more than 2 seasons of agent carter.	Mindhunter (a Netflix original) is so damn good. It takes place in the either the mid to late 70’s. The first season is out now, it has 10 episodes.
What have you done lately that makes you proud?	I turned down a biscuit for fresh fruit at breakfast this weekend. Biscuits and gravy is one of my favorite things in the world, so I was very proud!	3 weeks and 3 days ago I packed my and my 1 year old son's bags, left my alcoholic husband, and haven't had a drop to drink since. I've lost fifteen pounds without trying, have the full support of my friends, and have an appointment for a pro bono divorce attorney this week. Had to bite the bullet and apply for cash assistance and am staying in a women's shelter while I search for housing and jobs (I was a SAHP and have no income or family in the area), but I FEEL AMAZING and haven't had such an elated outlook for the future in far too long.
Has your SO ever tried to set you up to catch you cheating? What happened and did you stay with her?	I passed her "shit test" and dumped her for the girl she tried to get me to cheat on her with. Poetic justice. AND, since girl2 willingly participated I already knew she was a crappy person, but she was really hot so I had as much sex with her as possible until I couldn't stand her Machiavellian BS any longer.	Once, a girl I dated came up to me with an earring. "Who does this belong to?" "I have no idea" "Don't lie to me!" I racked my brain to think of who it could belong to. All my female friends lived in other cities at the time and my friends weren't dating anyone at the time so there had literally been no other girls in my apartment for probably months. Wait, maybe it was that girlfriend of a friend of a friend that came in here as part of that large group? That was only for 15 minutes, but still... "Well?" "Sorry, I have no idea" "I'm just kidding, it's my earring, I just wanted to see how you'd react"
Ladies, how many of you are dating someone that's not your physically ideal man? Do they know? How does it make them feel?	My current bf is the first white guy i've ever dated. He always knows that he's not my "type". He also knows that I think he looks old (there's quite an age gap between us, and I look young for my age). I think he does feel conscious from time to time, but I've made it clear that although i don't think he is that good looking, I'm still hugely attracted to him physically. And he's pretty comfortable being who he is so it's not really a big deal. One time I teased him about his look and he said "Don't try too hard to make me feel unattractive. I'd hate to see you fail."	Honestly, I was pretty meh about men with beards until I met my boyfriend. My tastes changed real fast. Also, dating my "ideal physical man" <<<<< dating a guy I'm attracted to on a number of levels. To sum up, dating my physical fantasy does not matter and has no real effect on my relationship.
Just out of curiosity, what are jobs that a man/woman could have that are dealbreakers for you?	Personally: politician, political staff, military, law enforcement, and probably a lawyer or a surgeon. There are definitely a few others but those are the first that come to mind.	Any job that involved being away for long periods. Like long haul airline pilots or submariners or any business that involves extensive traveling.
Bridesmaids: What are some things that your brides did that really upset you?	For her bachelorette party she chose a casino and buffet- $55/person 2 hours from where I live. I'm a vegetarian and all I could eat was a shitty salad. I also had to bring my 4 month old son and SO to help care for my baby. The party started at 7 and by 8 pm I had to leave because 4 MONTH OLD BABY. The wedding was even worse and I don't even want to go there.. But bottom line is I hate weddings.	I feel like a unicorn sometimes, in that the weddings I've been in (or adjacent to) have all had brides who were the same wonderful easygoing people (if more stressed) that I was friends with to begin with. No complaints whatsoever. One thing I learned from my own wedding, though, is that there can be such a thing as "too chill" to the point that it becomes unhelpful. We strongly didn't want our small wedding party to have to buy new matching clothes, so we told my sister/MoH and sister-in-law/groomswoman to just "wear blue," and told our best man/ushers to "wear whatever." This led a couple of them to freak out at the lack of direction, and we ended up having to give some more specific guidelines after all.
What are the pros and cons of owning your own home? Which do you prefer and why?	Think about this: Every homeowner will die having thousands of dollars to their name that was spent on the house from down payments, taxes, repairs, etc. When you're on your death bed imagine there is a giant stack of tens of thousands of dollars getting set on fire that you never used. I would rather rent an amazing house I could never afford to buy and spend the down payment on traveling the world and dying having spent all of my money on adventures across the globe.	The best thing about it for me has been getting away from all the scuzz in my old apartment complex. My house is fairly isolated and very quiet. I can actually get to sleep before midnight. Having a garage and extra space is nice, too. Obviously there's more work involved in owning a home. You have to maintain stuff and be around for maintenance, that sort of thing. I feel like it's worth it.
What was your favorite date that wasn't just getting food with your SO?	not sure how "significant" my "SO" is, but he is the guy i've been dating all summer. the best date so far: middle of the day during the week. he left work early (i work from home), brought my favorite food over for lunch (chipotle burrito bowls) then helped me set up my media cabinet from cb2 that had just been delivered. i swooned! the simplest date ever, but it meant a lot to me.	We did some trespassing to take photos of run-down buildings. When dusk fell, we watched hundreds of bats fly out of an old barn. It was our second date and still my favorite one.
What unrealistic expectations do young men have about women?	Some young men expect you to be their mommyyyyyyyyyt:c mommyyyy where are you mommyyyy. Go die I am not such a thing. If anything I'm more like your bitter old grandfather. Bye	That our vaginas will smell like fresh flowers and clean laundry or whatever. I mean, it shouldn't smell *bad*, or fishy, but it DOES have a smell, and it is NOT like mangoes or cotton candy or whatever they fuck they seem to think it should smell like. Also, like a lot of other posters in this thread, I feel like a lot of the boys I dated in high school were way too horrified about periods, body hair, and other natural functions of the female body. They seemed to not want to acknowledge that girls are just people.

What are some appalling recipes I can make for a soulless thief who is stealing food from a communal fridge?	You should confront this person instead of becoming a vengeance-crazed, passive aggressive maniac. If you continue down the current path you'll be keying cars that park poorly before you know it.	If you make cookies, you can make a colored icing that is guaranteed to dye their mouth blue. Basically mix confectioners sugar with water and blue food coloring, as much food coloring as possible. It'll stain the hands, clothing, and mouths of whoever consumes them. Found this out by accident while making TARDIS cookies for a friend's birthday party
Guys who enjoy being single: Do you get lonely? What do you like best about being single? What do you dislike the most about it?	What I like most about being single is that I only have to live up to my own expectations and I never do anything I don´t want to do. I look at males I know and the things they do with their girlfriends and I would hate to have to do them. A) Going out to dinner B) Going to the cinema C) Going shopping with her D) Spending time with her family E) Having to pretend to give a shit about her coworkers and what they get up to, nobody cares and if they do tell them and not me. etc etc etc	Sometimes i do get lonely but it's never strong enough to make me think "I wish i had someone". I love living alone, doing what i want, not having to compromise, choosing what or where i eat, when, i love waking up alone, going to sleep alone, i'm just a loner. I really wonder how the fuck i will manage to live with someone in the future. The uncool things are the occasionnal loneliness, the lack of sharing and the lack of human heat.
When you gave birth, what's one thing you wish someone did or gave you?	I just wish they had inserted the IV correctly in my arm instead of puncturing the artery all the way through. I also wish they had inserted the epidural correctly so it didn't just paralyze my left side and leaving my right side able to feel everything. And privacy would have been nice. Since it was a complicated labor that took 43 hours I ended up with about 20 different people staring into my vagina as if it were some mystical oracle of the future.	My mother in law came about 2 weeks after the birth. She cleaned our house top to bottom in all the public areas - living room kitchen dining room guest bathroom. It was amazing to go into my sparkling kitchen after barely being able to keep up with emptying the dishwasher. I still talk about how shiny my sink was. Our house has never been so clean.
[Serious] What does an abortion feel like?	I want to ask a few follow up questions: 1) Did you tell the guy? (one night stand? boyfriend?) 2) If you did tell them, did they go with you to get the procedure/meds/clinic in general? 3)What did you learn from all this experience? (i'm not trying to shame you or anything, just wondering what you think you could have done differently before)	surgical, 2009. was lightly sedated. it felt like really intense cramps and a little bit of scraping. i cried after. i cry a lot, tho. then, overwhelming relief. some loneliness. mostly relief. i felt loopy for the rest of the day, and then sore and crampy for a day or so after. felt kinda "raw" inside for a little while? the nausea stuck with me for a few more days while my body got back to normal. i threw up a ham sandwich.
What are the dumbest/worst things you've heard someone say "It means she wants to have sex" about?	If her shoe is hanging off her foot it means she's cool and relaxed and up for a good time...... ... You'd be surprised how well this actually works at a bar I've tried it and holy shit it's like some secret man trigger.	The thing about matching underwear. Some people just like wearing matching underwear, it doesn't mean they're planning anything and even then you might change your mind later.
Would you ever consider adopting a child? Why? Why not?	Nope- you don't know what genetic issues and aggressions you're up against. Plus the only reason to have a kid is because my and my fiancée genes are so good that it would be cruel not to	I've been thinking more and more about it lately. I do want children but I just ... I can't easily explain it but I feel so weird about having another body inside my body. I don't think I can deal with the physical changes of pregnancy. To me it doesn't feel magical. I don't want my whole shit to change. I'm really private and get skin creepy-crawlies when someone touches my stomach. I don't think pregnancy would work for me. But I love kids. And I'd love to adopt. It's expensive and difficult though my company covers adoption costs.
Do you ever kiss a FWB outside of sex?	No. I held pretty firm boundaries with my old fwb because I got burned by blurring them by things like this before. IMO, I think you should focus more on the sex. No hanging out outside of sex. No Facebook friendship. No texting outside of setting up meets or sexting/flirting. No kissing outside of sex. Even minimal cuddling. I know it sounds cold, but it worked out great.	This is somewhat related. I used to be a porn producer. Every performer, contract or not, had a list of things they would do or didn't do. Most of it was extreme things like scat, watersports, large objects, etc. But kissing was actually pretty common as well. The performers (men and women, in gay or straight porn) felt that kissing was more intimate than the sex itself, so if they had an SO at the time, the kissing would be reserved for them. Sometimes the girls would just do girl-girl if they were in a relationship, but most of the time it was kissing that became the special act between them and the person they loved.
What are some outdated customs that don’t make sense anymore, but people still follow them simply out of tradition?	Eating meat. Except for people with rare health conditions, you can be completely healthy without eating meat, and it is particularly easy in developed countries where so many foods are available. The environmental destruction caused by meat and animal production causes is beyond belief. But everyone still eats it because that's what they have always done.	this may be just where I live, but most people here are lukewarm Catholics who only baptize their kids out of tradition and so that they will be able to attend Catholic schools which are known to be stricter and more homogenous.
What female name is an instant turnon for you?	Why do you have to say female? Christ guys can like dudes too and shouldn't be purposefully excluded from every other thread. Ya know what fuck it. Cody.	I'm secretly hoping all the women who see this headline are in here just to ctrl+f their names and I'm not the only one because that would make me feel weird. Like caring what Disney Princess I am on the latest facebook quiz.
On the Ask of: "Never Stop Courting Your Wife", what can Wives/Girlfriends do for their SOs' to make them/you feel special, loved and courted back?	Stay in shape! Nothing says “I’m not courting you any more” like gaining a bunch of weight and draining the lust out of the sexual experience.	Some things my wife does to make me feel loved: Be the big spoon every now and then. Snuggle up next to me in places like the theater, train rides, etc. Hold my hand when walking Even though she’s reading, just sit out on the boat with me while I go fishing. She’s there to talk and enjoy company with me.
What are some things you admired about your ex you wish your current SO had or did?	A lot of women here are saying they wish their SO would do more sweet things for them. Is that all women care about? Being loved? Ever think of maybe giving your SO some love too, or do you just want to receive it? So many here are saying 'he took me on cool dates' or 'he complemented me'. Do you ever do stuff like that for your SO? Probably not, no. So imagine what that feels like. You're here complaining that your SO doesn't do these sweet little things for you when you literally do NONE of that for him anyway. It's completely one sided.	My ex was very touchy feely kind of guy and constantly complimented me and I sometimes wish my Husband had more of that [he is not a very romantic person]. But then I get over it when I realize how honest my SO is in comparison with my ex. I know he means it when he says something romantic. My ex just used sweet words to manipulate me instead of being straight so...
What was the smoothest move you've ever made on a woman?	So working at a reasturant thats "down on the farm" on a smoke break with a buddy when a cute server walked out and started talking with us. anyway i finish my smoke and start walking back in when i turn and ask her " do you have any knee pads?" She responds " no why?" So i respond "well you better get some cause your gonna need the." We've been together almost ten years celebrating our third wedding anniversary.	I was having a conversation in a club with this really weird and cool chick and she pulls off a tiny unicorn head plushie from her bag. She told me something like "Did you know that if you grab an unicorn's horn you can ask for a wish?" And I was like "Oh for real?" And then I touched the plushie's horn and asked for her number. She laughed and then gave me the digits. That was the only time I asked for the number of a girl and Im a little bit bummed out of probably never being able to top it.
Are you attracted to a mans butt?	Yes. Yes, I will do something with it. I will grab it, slap it, squeeze it, rub it, and I might even bite it...	What do you mean we don't do anything with a butt? We grab it, squeeze it, slap it, and just look at it. When I had a FWB I saw his bare ass all the time.
So I was out with this girl I've been seeing and I left in the middle of it (I'm 28M). Full story is in the thread. Can you help me decide if I made the right decision to leave?	Whoa, whoa, whoa! We know nothing about this girl, and you guys already have your pitchforks sharpened and torches lit! Does she have any level of social anxiety? She ducked into the bathroom with her roomie, and her roomie was probably in there talking her down. Had this been some SAP who made a meme about it, the hivemind would be saying things like, "there's nothing wrong with social anxiety" or "If she doesn't understand your challenges, GTFO!" The fact is that we have one side of the story. His side...which may or may not be the whole story. Based on that side, they weren't exclusive, so there shouldn't be any issue. A bit of a dick move? Yep...but at least you paid for the drinks.	>I'm not usually a dick like that, so I feel guilty just getting up and leaving. She fucking bailed and went and hid in the bathroom to avoid the two of you. You did fine.
How do you function normally in daily life while battling with depression?	Take the easy way out and get on some SSRIs. It'll change your personality and decrease your sex drive, but thems the breaks	I just do what I need to do like I did before depression. I get up, take care of myself, exercise, eat, clean etc. because I know it's better for me than doing nothing. I don't want the depression to win so I don't let it. I feel nothing inside but I try not to let it show by being polite and attempting to be friendly. I almost feel like I am faking everything but it's better than lying in bed all day.
So husbands, I’ve been thinking a lot about marriage lately, and I’m curious; How did you know she was the one? And how long did it take you to figure it out?	She's not the one. There's no such thing. She's one of millions of women I could be happy and settled with. Sometimes the truth isn't romantic.	We went through several family shakeups and travel nightmares without breaking a sweat. No relationship is perfect, but when shit goes down, she doesn’t fuck around.
What things do men say to try and be caring, but achieve the opposite?	"Text me when you make it home." No, I'm a damn independent woman and can walk 10 blocks in my own neighborhood just fine. (I know some women like that, but I don't)	When faced with any mundane decision - "I don't care, I'll let you decide". Like it's a favor to me to have to choose dinner, date location, movie, etc. every single time. To be fair I'm sure this isn't a man specific thing.
What's your last minute Halloween costume?	Not for all audiences: Poke holes in a trash bag an wear it like a shirt, then tie a piece of garden hose around your waist. You're a hose bag.	Take a page out of the office and cut out 3 circles of black construction paper and attach to yourself and say you are "3 hole punched such and such".
What was your most awkward (but not neccessarily bad) sexual encounter?	I had a threeway that involved a girl whose boyfriend was out in the living room having a hissyfit the whole time. So we cucked some poor guy unintentionally. It was more distracting than expected.	There was a girl I used to hook up with just for sex. We were both single but didn't have anything in common except sex. We were parked in an alley and She is riding me in the backseat of a car reverse cowgirl and another couple just laid on the hood of my car and started having sex. We stopped and the girl on the hood looked up and locked eyes with the girl I was with for a good 5 seconds. We all just stopped.
Honestly, how do you stay strong?	I stay strong by being strong. I've fought a lot of fights in this world. Physical fights, financial fights, metaphorical fights. Homelessness, heartbreak, life-threatening illness, despair, divorce, abusive childhood, whole nine. And I don't even think of it as staying strong. I think of it as staying alive because the alternative sucks. As Dropkick Murphys put it, "You fight for your life because a fighter never quits, you make the most of the hand you're dealt because a quitter never wins." And I'm a religious man. I'm not gonna quit and then try to explain to the gods why I pussed out when it was time to man up. No excuses, no crying, no bullshit. Just like March Madness. Survive and advance.	I seek or accept help when it's offered, and I put my energy into the things that will get me optimal results. Strength isn't about facing the entire world by yourself using only your bare hands, it's about finding out how to get to where you will thrive by any means and any assistance necessary, and putting one foot in front of the other with honesty and courage in order to get there.
Have you ever backed out of sex, and why?	I have backed out of sex more times than I've had sex. I hate myself and my body and I can't abide the idea of someone else having to see it. And I'm naturally suspicious of anyone who claims to find me attractive. My brain tells me they must be lying and that I am a useless piece of shit. Edit- why would someone down vote this?	She wanted me to have sex with her on all fours. When she bent over, the smell was so potent it was like what I imagine gazing into the fires of Mt. Doom feels like. Even then, I was willing to muster on, but right as I was grabbing a condom, she apologized that she hadn't showered in two weeks. I learned that day it's "common for people to do that in the winter." Nope. Nope.gif. Nope.jpeg. Never.png.
Is it irrational that this annoys me?	I would find it very disrespectful. My guy friends know that if I bring along one of my girl friends, they can flirt, exchange numbers, plan followup events, but they do not take that girl home. It's obvious that hooking up would cause an awkward situation for me and my friends respect that. Maybe you should talk to the guys and set up some rules? That's what I had to do. It's been working amazingly ever since; however, I'm also very picky about what girls I take out with me.	Your male and female friends are adults and they can do what they like. If they want to hook up or do anything then you don't really have a say in it. That being said it is annoying as fuck when you have friends who put you in the middle of their relationship and pump you for information, or involve you in their casual hook-up drama.

What was the "bruh..." moment when your friend said something stupid to a girl that made her lost interest in him?	Out at a bar one night when a friend, M, tells us that he's going to talk to the bartender. He doesn't usually do this but had some liquid courage. Asks for her number and if she'd like to hang out sometime when she's not working. She agrees and all of us are dumbfounded. He actually went though with it. Fast forward 3 or 4 days and we ask him if they ever hung out. M goes on to say that she asked if he'd like to go to another bar and hangout. He responded with "Nah, I don't go out." To this day I laugh at how beta the poor dude was.	Once in a bar I heard a guy tell a woman "You're hot, you know...if good looks were a washing machine, I would put a dirty load inside of you." Didn't work out for him.
Those who prefer pads to tampons - why?	I played volleyball so tampons were a must with spandex. Since I've only ever wore them - thats what I feel most comfortable wearing. If you don't like tampons where pads - it's not a big deal.	I hate the feeling of pushing a tampon in, and when my flow is light, the feeling of taking out a tampon that is still a bit dry.
Women of reddit who work out, what changes have you noticed that you didn't expect?	This past month I've gone to the gym 6 days a week. I feel more relaxed most of the day, but also more tired at night. I usually run 3 miles every time I go, just because I like to run. I've lost a significant amount of body fat; my face looks better shaped, and my body looks thin, fit, and more proportionate. Only downside I've noticed is: my butt shrank a small bit. If you're trying to loose extra fat/pounds I recommend running 3 miles almost every day at around 8-10 mph	I have a butt now. I mean, I did expect to eventually have a nicer looking one, but I guess it's not just my thigh muscles that build up really fast. It happened a lot faster than I was anticipating.
Do you find most guys are bad kissers? What do they do wrong? Do you bring it up when you don't like it?	We all like different things, and do different things. Much like sex, you have to communicate. If that's too much to ask, lower your expectations.	Out of the 12 or so guys I've kiss, I'd say I had 5 who were just awful. They open their mouths super wide and essentially try to eat my face. I actually developed a nasty cracking sound in my jaw from having to open my jaw beyond the comfortable level. Mostly brought on by a guy I refer to as Tuna.
How do you keep yourself from crying in situations you don't want to be seen crying?	I've established a reciprocal crying arrangement with a co-worker. If either of us is about to start crying, we go to the others office, close the door and pretend we are in a meeting. If she's out of the office, I go to the washroom until I get control of myself.	I think about totally random things - lettuce. books. stairs. fruit. I just run through a list of random objects to distract myself and calm myself down enough to stop the tears.
Whats a good story you have that you can't really tell your friends in real life?	That I love sleeping with Pre-op Trans Woman. Blowing them is a lot of fun. If I tell them, then they'll assume I'm gay and I'm not into dudes at all. I've tried it, not my thing. Edit: So many typos	Dani Daniels took my glasses off my face, put them between her ass cheeks, rub them on her pussy, licked them, then put them back on my face. Quite the experience.
How's your new relationship working out, guys?	It's okay. We get along really well. She's not nearly as good looking as past gfs however. I'm hoping it's not a problem later...	Not sure if this counts as new. Me and my high school sweetheart got back together back in April after not seeing each other for almost 4 years but we dated all of high school. It's absolutely amazing. I was head over heels in love with her and never got over her. We both didn't date anyone in college because we both loved each other too much. It's so nice to be in her life and everything feels right again.
Do Women Demand Too Much From Men? How Much is Too Much?	>Do Women No women aren't one thing, if you ask if all women do something then the answer is almost always no.	There really isn't a such thing as asking too much, just being unprepared for the reality of not getting it. Dating is a world where you don't get what you deserve, you get what you can acquire. A woman of average looks can expect a decent amount of attention but not the overwhelming shower conspicuously attractive women get. Who she is to make one of those men think that he doesn't need to consider someone else is up to her.
Would you ever be a house-husband?	I'd like to say life is fair and even, but I honestly believe that if I did my (future) wife would lose respect for me. I also believe sexually oriented characteristics are innate, and it would be slightly conflicting to everyone in the family	> Assuming kids are not a factor Honestly, are there even housewives in situations where kids aren't a factor? It really doesn't take that long to run errands, clean the house and doing occasional bouts of car/house maintenance.
How do I convince this guy I like that I am not trying to trick him when I tell him he is attractive?	Booze. I know what this guy is feeling. Booze will help him mellow out and get you into his pants.	If he's anything like me then he was never complimented by girls for most of his life. So to be suddenly getting compliments feels like its just a joke or insincere. To fix this is a combination of time, more compliments, and getting physical. Take the actions speak louder than words approach, but continue complimenting him. Cause a majority of guys are never told they are good looking.
Do you try to book your events / vacations based on what your menstrual cycle is?	nope. but when i was with my boyfriend, now ex, we would only see each other on the weekends. i take birth control and i worked it out so that there would never be a weekend where i was on my period, for the obvious reason	I don’t necessarily book things around it but I always check when I’m going to have it when I find out the date of something. I just like to be prepared.
About what % of your friends met their spouse in their early 20s?	I don't have friends, so that's kinda hard to answer. I married my first wife at 19, finally got rid of her at 27. Met my current wife, and my partner, at 32 and have been with them 25 years. Most of the people that I knew in high school were married and had kids by 21. THANKFULLY, my first wife and I never had kids... If she has gotten pregnant, it would have been by someone else's dick, because I tried to keep mine out of her as much as possible 😂🤣	I think here in Utah it’s a lot different due to the Mormon community. I know people who got married the day after graduating high school. Others within their first year or so of college. I am 23(f) and the majority of the people I grew up with are married (with and without children) and are planning for more children, building houses, etc. Since I am not religious, I got a dog instead.
Does anyone else disagree with this: "I don't tell him I have a boyfriend because he should respect my 'no' more than another man's ownership of me." ?	The "NO" isn't about respecting another man. It's fear of the unknown. The guy isn't respecting your boyfriend by backing off. He's playing it safe. He doesn't know your boyfriend. Your boyfriend could be a 6ft 4in MMA fighter for all he knows. If the guy thought he could kick your boyfriends ass, he'd still try. But yes, your NO should be enough. Grown women shouldn't be playing hard to get anyway.	I think the real argument is that if a guys starts making unwanted advances, saying "I'm not interested" should be enough. We shouldn't have to make up fake boyfriends for the guy to accept our "no".
Women of Reddit who didn't want to but ended up having kids, what was your experience like?	I never wanted kids and took birth control for years. I had a long term bf and he would wear condoms when I stopped taking the pill due to health reasons. Well I got pregnant. As soon as I found out I aborted. 8 months later same thing happened again. To make a long story short I had a total of 7 abortions in a 8 years period. I now have a son that is 15. The doctor told me another abortion will be very hard on my system. Reluctantly I kept this child. He is now 17 all I can say is that I wish he would have been aborted also. I guess I’m not cut out to be a mother	Hmm I'm the daughter of a mother who didn't really want kids or think she'd have them due to the possibility of an inherited disability. Long story short my parents saw a geneticist who said as long as they had kids before a certain age the risk was lower so they went ahead and had my sister and I as my Dad did want kids (although to be honest he just liked the idea of kids rather than the actual raising & responsibility of them). My mum used to tell me she felt cheated having us as we didn't fit into her plans or have the same interests as her. I think that people need to realise that the kids have no choice in this matter once they are born and I hate that my relationship with my parents is so poor because we weren't really wanted.
This was asked in AskWomen, but I'm curious as to how men would respond: Do you think Reddit is sexist/misogynistic/a hostile environment toward females?	I think a lot of people don't understand satire. Acting sexist is only funny because of how ridiculously unacceptable it is. When acting sexist in jest you are mocking those who do it in earnest. Many people have a hard time making that distinction which is what leads to confusion IMO.	the default subs certainly are, they're a closer reflection of society and there is a lot of misogyny (and misandry, and racism and all kinds of other bullshit) in society smaller ones like /r/askwomen and this one are much better, although there will always be misogyny that pops up from time to time
College students of AskMen, how are you doing?	I'm doing okay. My grades are decent and my social life is going well but I think it's time I find a girl to build a relationship with.	After going through a breakup and likely failing 2 classes, I’m back on my feet and doing great.(besides my gpa, rip)

What hobbies did you pick up in your 20s-30s?	Knitting, big band music, banjo/bluegrass, gypsy jazz (for those last three, listening to. Not playing. I have what they call "dumb fingers" and "laziness"). There might be some other things, but that's all I can think of atm	Gardening is probably the most enjoyable hobby I've taken a liking too in my early 20s. I always adored my grandma's garden. It was a two-tiered garden and she cared for it meticulously. So much green, so many beautiful flowers in a rainbow of colors. So having my own house I kinda felt like it demanded me take some time to beautify it the best I could!
What female character tropes/cliches irritate you the most?	All women shoot bows in fantasy settings. Sorry, but shooting bows requires some heavy lifting strength, no way a 15 year old rebel girl would be able to use that effectively.	The "I'm not like other girls because I was raised by 73 brothers, I'm incredible hot and ridiculously smart, also I'm single!"
Did you end up in a totally different career to what you studied for? And how?	oh 100&#37; Studied Psychology in University and now I work as a Business Analyst in Oil & Gas. I would've loved to follow a career in psych, but I couldn't get accepted into Grad Schools. :\( I enjoy working in Oil & Gas mainly because I make good money and it's a flexible company that treats their employees well.	Yup, I went to school for early childhood education and English, with the idea that I would be a kindergarten teacher and write. I hated student-teaching, but thought it would get better. A month in, and I was completely miserable, and was talking to my parents about it. I offhand said that I should have been a lawyer instead. My mom told me "women lawyers are bitches". So I registered for the LSAT that night, did well, got accepted to a good school moved across country and now I'm a practicing attorney. So I did a career change out of spite. And I'm so much happier.
Women who are the reason for your and your partner's dead bedroom (DB), whats *your* side of the story?	I guess I got busy because I was studying for the bar exam and then I become a stressed out lawyer so that probably killed it and he was pretty passive and never said anything. He also gained a bunch of weight (me too) but he’s 100 lbs heavier than me and was already heavy so I’m sure he has increased estrogen or low T that I think he will finally see a doctor about. I’m super pissed off about it because I try but he honestly can’t seem to perform and he freaks out. If I thought I could cheat and get away with it I would.	He would subtly put me down throughout the day or do minor things that annoyed me like tickling, poking and prodding or make dumb loud noises. All of this happened on repeat all day every day and drove me to insanity. So naturally the sex drive died pretty quick. In a less subtle situation he would call me stupid/idiot and freak out at minor things, say he dropped a utensil while cooking or if he walked into my shoes by the doorway. It would result in me being yelled at. Don’t really want to have sex after a day full of that and I could never get it through to him that I want to feel loved and safe and not be on edge for when I’ll be yelled at next, then maybe I’d want to have sex.
Women who have been shot and also given birth, which is worse and why?	In terms of physical discomfort, my emergency c-section didn't even rate in my top 5 worst pain. Hooray for spinal anesthetic? Worst pain I've personally experienced was when I had to rinse my mouth with Listerine after getting my tongue pierced.	My mother had an accident hiking that resulted in an open fractured femur and a shattered pelvis. Keep in mind that she was in the woods and help didn't reach her for several hours while she was fully conscious. She said the pain didn't compare to giving birth naturally to twins.
When urinating into a toilet while within earshot of females, do you quietly aim your stream onto the edge of the bowl so you don't gross them out, or do you piss directly into the deepest part of the water for maximal decibel output so that your dick sounds bigger?	I don't ever do that when "females" are around. However, I do occasionally do it when women (you know, the actual name for human beings) are nearby.	Ok, I have to say as a girl if I hear a guy peeing super loudly I wouldn't think he had a big dick. I would think he had been holding in his pee for a long time. I don't even have a dick but can pee super loud, myself, after a few beers, so I don't see the correlation.
[Serious] A girl physically assaults you (slap, punch, kick, etc). What are you supposed to do that doesn't land you in cuffs?	I have been in this situation. I knocked her out cold. I punched her once. A real haymaker in the side of her head. Police were never involved. What the fuck would she do? I had 30 witnesses and she had been harassing all of them. Bitch had it coming. Edit: If it was a man i would kick him when he went down too. I don't believe in an eye for an eye. I believe in if you touch me i will beat you to a fucking pulp.	Relavant. I sat on a jury for a case where a young man was charged with assault and false imprisonment for holding his screaming and punching girlfriend's fists shut when they were in a hotel elevator. Witnesses in the lobby were alarmed as they saw a shit storm of domestic violence, called 911 and the cops arrested the young man. This couple needed to walk away from each other but neither had the maturity to do so. As a jury, we decided there was insufficient evidence and found the defendant not guilty. Still, it took a year for a court date to open up while this poor couple burned through money processing legal fees. Walking away or calling security supports your case that you were being assaulted. Self defense from a man on a woman is easily misinterpreted as assault.
How did you overcome your addiction, and what were you addicted to?	I'm a meme addict. I've been addicted since 2011, and it's troubling me. I can't have a normal conversation with anyone. I'm always shouting memes and drawing them in class. It's a serious issue and I haven't been able to get over it.	Shopping. It sounds kind of petty when people here have struggled with serious stuff like drug addiction. Shopping really puts a strain in my life as I spend on things that I don't need and that don't make me happy outside of the moment I'm doing it. I would like to travel and spend more on experiences that actually make me happy but I see a sale and somehow I lose control and immerse myself in this sea of material junk.
What does it feel like to have a girl love you?	Kinda like having a puppy love you, but boobs and manipulation. So....I guess I don't actually know because I was practically a human pacifier to satisfy an emotional gap while they rebuilt their confidence. Highly overrated.	Once you get past the infatuation phase, it's kinda like a warm fuzzy blanket. I love snuggling up to my wife, doing things together, & spoiling her with random gifts. Seeing her smile makes my stress melt away. Sure, we bang too, but for me, it's more about knowing that all is right in my life. We share moments that make me feel like I'm having a pleasant dream during a nap under the sun. But I'm not dreaming. It's real. And that makes me smile from the heart.
Mattel has "evolved" Barbie to have four new body types. What do you think?	They're not really different body 'types,' just various weights. All similar heights. Similar hair. All still pretty. Still an idealized version of beauty, just some aren't as thin. IMO, I think it was a clever marketing tool by Mattel brought on by the HAES crowd. I love Barbie and buy them for my nieces, but don't really have an opinion otherwise beyond thinking it was good marketing	You know, as a kid, I would've been thrilled, but not for the body representation. I would've literally just done this: "The bigger one is the mommy, the tall one is gonna be a daddy and I'll cut his hair (I never wanted Ken dolls), the littlest one is the baby sister, and then this one is the big sister!" And then I'd try to remove the 'daddy' doll's make-up with turpentine, wipe off its face altogether, try to draw it back on with sharpie, grow bored, and go do something else.
Excluding touch, in what ways do you subtly flirt? What are some things you'd do for a girl you're interested in and not for a girl you weren't?	Yesterday a girl I have no interest in spilled her drink. She said she had it so I sat there and stared at her. Had I cared I would have came back with a rag and polished her shoes if she wanted.	Touch is definitely a big one, but there are plenty of visual and verbal cues too. Simply talking, building that personal connection, flirting with/teasing her, etc. Just crank up the charm and capitalize on that sexual/romantic tension. When it comes to verbal flirting, I like to use a lot of "we" statements. Not in a "let's-get-hitched-right-now" way, of course. More in a "Bonnie and Clyde" way, how *we* can get up to all sorts of trouble together. It's hard for me to explain it without concrete examples, but it's fun and it builds rapport. ~~Then I whip it out.~~
Have you ever gotten an unexplainable, sleazy vibe from a man who, by all accounts, is well-respected and likable to others? What was your experience like?	Harry Weinstein Olympic Gymnastic Coaches Donald Trump U.S. Politicians Professional Football Players Employers Teachers Educators NFL Coaches Youth Sports Coaches Various Medical Doctors Church Staff Relatives Acquaintances I haven't experienced sexual abuse. We know from the examples above that it always starts with grooming.	Years ago when I was in college, I started a summer job where I worked with a wide array of people. There was one older man who everyone talked about him affectionately, but he just gave me the creeps. He would go out of his way to find me and talk to me on his shift, give strange looks, and offer to walk me to my car at night. Turns out...he was just a really nice older man who liked to talk was very awkward. I finally saw him talking to a group of people and turns out he wasn’t picking up on any social cues, male or female. I really saw how wrong I was about him when I met his wife of 35ish years! She brought him his lunch one night when he forgot it...two awkward and talkative peas in a pod!
(NSFW) Women who have anal sex often, how does anal sex compare to vaginal sex?	Lemme guess, this is you cleverly trying to justify why your girlfriend needs to give up her anal cherry. Too bad it seems to have **backfired**	They feel very different.. For me to orgasm through anal it has to be very gentle and with clitoral stimulation. However, *some* doods get the impression from porn that they can just dig their dicks right in. NU UH! For me, I prefer a finger in the ass for short periods of time rather than a dick. I only have a small anal plug so I definitely need to get more to work my way up to comfortably being able to take a dick. I've had big and small orgasms through anal. I've had no orgasms and bleeding. And I've also gotten UTI's from anal so... eh...
How gropey/handsy are you and your partner? Is it important to you?	I grope my girlfriend constantly. She has only complained if I do it too overtly in public. Don't worry about what a bunch of fat sjw's think. You and your SO sound happy with each other, and that's all that should matter to you.	We're constantly touching. It would be a big deal for me if she didn't like it. It's a show of affection, not objectification.
Who is the sexiest girl you know, and what makes her so sexy?	My SO is so fucking sexy. This could be my opinion but she gets hit on a lot so I dont think I'm an outlier. She is Mexican but looks exotic. Big fake boobs that look real (I insulted her on our first date by accident not knowing her tits are fake) and she fucks like a pornstar. Anyone who has heard the song "Foreign" by Trey Songz will know what I'm talking about. Edit: haha I accidentally wrote tots instead of tits. Don't make me choose between them Reddit, I love them both.	A former employee who worked for me about 8 or 9 years ago when she was in college. She's beautiful, long black hair, beautiful greenish brown eyes, incredible legs. She has an incredibly sexy walk, I'm a sucker for a certain walk that not many woman have but she certainly does. Mentally she's also incredible; very intelligent, passionate, caring and introspective. She opted to teach in a high school with mostly poor students who have been written off and she cares that her students succeed, she's bought tablets for them to use in class, paid for clothes for a kid who was thrown out of her foster home and still has time to go on funny rants about Oscar red carpet interviews and the like. She also has just enough crazy to be interesting. She's just the complete package physically, mentally and psychologically.
What's the worst ending of a friendship you have experienced?	Had a friend out of the blue announce to the group she was getting engaged to an Indian man we had never met and had kept a it a secret from us all for 6 months? Oh, and announced she was moving as well. Did I mention he’s 9 years older than her and had no green card? We drifted apart after that one.	During high school, my parents and I took a month long trip to another state a few hours away and let me take my best friend who I had been friends with since 3rd grade on the trip after her parents agreed to let her go. Throughout the trip she was fine, we had fun and my parents never let her pay for any meals or toiletries she would need. Once we got back home, she immediately called her mom to pick her up and we’ve never spoken since. It’s been almost 10 years. I still don’t know what happened.
Does anyone else feel meh about giving blowjobs?	i think a lot of people exaggerate how much they like giving head just to seem cool or impress people, so i wouldn't feel bad if it's not something you get a lady boner over. i don't think that makes you prudish at all! i personally really enjoy it to a point, but i have the worst gag reflex so sometimes that kills it for me. but besides that it's something that really gets me going, especially surprise bjs. it also depends on the size. anything that's over maybe 7 and fairly thick is overwhelming to me	I do it because my husband loves it. I only enjoy it when he is moaning, being loud, etc. He used to hold back and be quiet, so it was really boring for me. But hearing him enojying it like nothing else. Is your partner overly silent when you do it? I know that for me, it hurts my jaw when I am in front of him, my face facing him(i guess typical pose?). It is infinitely more comfortable if i am facing his legs. 69 is a great position just because of this. I also love 69 because I get something out of it as well :) I normally can't finish through oral, but we are in that position he seems to hit more places, and i think me being on top tends to pull my insides in just the right place. You should try that!
How many of you don't drink alcohol?	I hate alcohol. It's fucking terrible. It's so bad that I'm pretty sure everyone who drinks is doing it just to fuck with me. Edit: Getting downvoted for not liking my drinks to taste like gasoline in a thread asking about not drinking, yeah that makes sense. Oh well	i'm 25 and haven't drank in three years. i used to drink and party a lot but grew out of it after living with guys who were functioning alcoholics. people are pretty judgemental about it, they either think you are some kind of pussy or a recovering alcoholic.
Are there any traits you think men tend to undervalue when looking for a date?	A woman who is genuinely a happy person, with a positive outlook on life. I've been with too many depressing women who take everything too seriously...	Someone you actually like and get along with early on It seems like so many dudes want a girlfriend so badly they would rather date whoever will go out with them rather than trying to date women they really enjoy spending time with. And then wonder a month later once they get to know the person, why they are incompatible. Don't try to find "a girlfriend." Don't be generic and look for someone to fill a role. Try to find a woman you want to bring into your life rather than any person who will fill the role.
What is the most hideous bridesmaid's dress you have or someone you know has been forced to wear?	Is this still a thing anymore? I don't mean just disagreeing with the bride's style choices, but rather the bride purposefully choosing bad looking dresses so she looks better? Seem like most brides are more interested in making sure their whole wedding looks really nice (so even if you don't like the style, you at least understand why it might be chosen). In fact, was this ever a common thing? I've only ever heard jokes about it or seen it in media. Sorry, I haven't seen anything truly terrible, so I was wondering.	I only was in one wedding where the bride picked out our dresses for us and it was fine - a pretty universally flattering gown (a-line, strapless but with the option to add straps, teal). However, she tried to have a little fun with us. When the other bridesmaids and I showed up for our dress fitting, she brought out the biggest, poofiest, neon pink and orange dress in the shop. I wish I had a picture. This thing was HIDEOUS! I've never seen so much tulle and sequins. Unfortunately for her, the entire group of us is pretty laid back about this kind of stuff. When she asked why we didn't get mad, we all just said, "Well, it's your wedding. We don't really get a say."
What book are you currently reading and how are you liking it?	[The Serapis Fraktur](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2438264264). << includes my links to my ongoing reading notes on GoodReads. If you want some dry wit salt, clickie the link. I have an on-again-off-again appreciation for this tome. But since I'm reading two at the same time, there's also [The Dragon of Stroma and Other Tales](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2435448470) which I am really enjoying (as you can see by clicking the link and reading my progress updates) so incredibly much.	Gonna get my english-grad points taken away but I'm actually rereading The Giver, because I first read it for school when I was 12 and I wasn't interested in it at all, and also I wasn't a terribly bright kid. I understand it much better now, but I also think that's partly from having an adult perspective and understanding what exactly is wrong in this society and where those problems came from.
Men of reddit, what are things girls think you care about but actually don't?	Make-up for sure. I could care less if my woman wears any as she is just as attractive without it. Though it IS MUCH MORE important that she keeps a 'good' body shape. Fitness is it, and thin is always in...	I dated a girl that bleached her asshole because she was insecure about its pigmentation. I don't care if your butthole is slightly brown or whatever. Just leave it alone FFS.
Here’s a thought experiment: If you took sexuality out of the equation, how many of the women you’ve ever dated would you actually be friends with? Some? Most?	None. I have nothing in common with them. I don't solve my problems by crying until someone fixes them for me, I am not interested in things like baking or flower arranging, and it bores me to tears when someone wants to complain without even thinking of a solution never mind working towards one. I also really wouldn't be friends with people whose core idea about men are hostile and deep down want men to be hurt, any more than black folks would have Klansmen friends, etc. I'm exaggerating to make a point but still. Nothing wrong with any of the above, it's just not me and I can't really work with that.	Probably about half. At this point, I won't date anyone I couldn't see myself being friends with. Sex is great, but I'm weird enough that if we couldn't be friends, we're probably not compatible as anything more than fuck buddies.
What celebrity has disappointed you?	Taylor Motherfucking Swift. Girl. I love you. But not going to the March? Not even your local one? Also, consorting with Lena Dunham? This is privileged white feminism at its finest.	I remember being disappointed with Britney Spears, but in the years since her meltdown I've come to be more empathetic when I see that sort of thing with other celebs.
What's the fastest you've gone from Tinder match getting a face-to-face date?	My last 3 matches have been 2 messages before we start scheduling a date. Usually it takes a bit to find out when and where we are meeting so I don't bother counting those messages. I don't like messaging a lot before meeting because i have a lot of irony based in my speech patterns and that doesn't convey well till after they know me.	A week. Matched, talked for 3 days or so, and I suggested a quick meetup at a coffee shop. That turned into a great 3 hour conversation. She is currently my GF and we've been together for over a year. Others were more in the 1-2 weeks range, but I took it pretty casually. Longest was a month due to geography and scheduling.
DAE have no social life on most days?	I talk to my dogs and cats a lot... like a lot. then I know it's time to call a friend up.	I really struggle to understand when you are supposed to initiate conversation with others or when they are with you. I feel so often I'm always the one sending the opening text or message on Facebook and that we chat for a short while and then that's it. I don't get the feeling they'd talk to me again if I didn't make the effort to talk to them. Often I've let friendships die because I've felt if they really wanted to hang out with me they'd talk to me and 100% of the time they never do. It can't always be me 100% of the time with the responsibility to initiate can it?
What are less obvious signs that you should end your relationship?	If you're not a person of habits, like you don't find it difficult to change things for the better and not like you get use to something too much even a change for the better feels uncomfortable, imagine what you would do if you met someone who truly seems better than your SO and you knew your SO wouldn't be upset at all to break up. That might help to figure out if you have strong feelings for your SO, you're happy with him and that's why you're with him or you're with him because you don't want to be single/you don't think you might meet someone better/you're afraid of hurting him by leaving.	When I started censoring my thoughts and opinions around him instead of excitedly sharing them, and resented his input instead of seeking it.
What is the most embarrassing SFW thing you are into?	I listen to a ton of folk punk despite my hatred for the scene and the kids that populate it. Not really that embarrassing, but every thing else I'm in to I fucking rock without a hint of shame.	I'm into ASMR. I wouldn't say I'm *embarrassed* of it, but it's not something I would bring up. If I were asked about it, I wouldn't deny it (happened before).

Do you repeat to your SO secrets that other people told you in confidence?	Yup. My friendship with an SO will always beat out my friendship with anyone else. Your secrets are also not safe from my best friend. Luckily I choose people who don't spread gossip, so it ends up staying between us. :b No I wouldn't tell the friend beforehand. Yes I'd do it even if they told me not to, and I'd add "So-and-so told me not to tell you" to the information I give him. Yes it depends on what it's about: if it's interesting, I'm telling; if it's not, there's no point. And yes I'd fully expect someone with a SO to tell them my secrets.	Unless I feel someone is somehow in danger, I keep the secrets that people trust me with. I can't imagine telling my SO someone else's secrets unless that were the case. As for my secrets... I don't really tell many people my secrets. I generally expect that my best friend might tell her boyfriend anything I don't specifically tell her not to, but it doesn't bother me because he's a close friend of mine, too.
Women who own their own businesses, what is it and how did you get started?	I am an illustrator and I sell prints of my work on etsy and go to comic expo's as an exhibiting artist. I'm still a student so it's not exactly a full plunge yet but I'm working on it!	Some could argue it's not a real "business" but I own and run a small English language school in a non-English speaking country. I teach there along with my only employee whom I stole from the first place we used to work together at. I started by being invited to a private school and gaining some real world experience after university. Then I went self employed and tutored in a small office in the center of the city. Not I rent a separate building and plan to build my own school =) I love it.
I'm 22 years old. If you were 22 again, what would you do differently?	Take that hot girl with the sparkle eyes who was just that chill and marry her, so I could dominate her daily while we were still young, and force her hips to squirt out the children our bodies were designed to be parenting at that age. Staying up all night sucks when you get to your mid-thirties, not to mention the increased risk of genetic deformity. Money is over-rated, items and "friends" are overrated. Do it like your grandparents and their grandparents and their grandparents, like your body was created to do. Have them early, and often, and tell "the world" to shove their judgement up their empty heads. They got plenty of space in the empty bank in their chests.	"take college seriously and do not drop out" *7 upvotes* "take college less seriously and improve my social life" *7 upvotes* hmmm
Men who have mastered the art of smiling at random attractive women without feeling like a grinning idiot; How?	Don't smile. It's generally a sign of submission. What you want is a very subtle "smirk". Han Solo does it well in this pic. Brooding is masculine, smiling is feminine. [https://blogs-images.forbes.com/markhughes/files/2015/08/Han-Solo-Star-Wars-4.png](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/markhughes/files/2015/08/Han-Solo-Star-Wars-4.png)	I’m actually smiling at how stupid I think I look instead of smiling at the woman. But they don’t know that.
Who do you think is strikingly attractive or too attractive?	cumberbatch for me. He just looks like hes from another planet. I find his features very beautiful and it's pretty much impossible for me to pinpoint what makes his face look so unique but it is.	This question makes me laugh, because I feel this way a lot: "How is *that* face even *possible*?" One that comes to mind that I don't see here is Morena Baccarin. She's been in a lot of shows, and she's always distractingly beautiful. Even when she puts up a good performance, I can barely pay attention.
What is a trait you find attractive , but comes hand in hand with something you hate ?	- I like intelligence, but I hate issues; both tend to go hand in hand in my experience. - I like good looks, but I hate it when a woman thinks she's the shit and behaves accordingly; again, both tend to go hand in hand.	Long hair == Loose hair everywhere. Hair all over the house. Hair in your food. Hair in your buttcrack when you're 500 miles apart and haven't seen each other for several days. *EDIT* To the people that keep saying "you need to shower better" in regards to the buttcrack hairs, hygiene or lack thereof is not where they come from. They cling to your clothes as a result of the washer or dryer. Lint rollers are no match for it.
I accidentally bought scented tampons. What products are you surprised still exist?	Can you not dip the scented tampons in green food due and make them in to the tree air fresheners you see in cars?	I bought scented tampons once. I didn't notice they were scented, and in fact didn't even know scented tampons existed. So when I pulled one out of my vag and the perfume mixed with the period smell, it smelled exactly like rotten meat - bloody, and sickly sweet. I was half convinced I had some sort of infection, until I realized what the smell was.
Who is the richest person you know and how is there life different from the average persons?	My family. Cheesy answer, but I really believe that "some people are so poor that all they have is money." My family has community, support, love, health, happiness, solid marriages, happy kids, fun, lots to talk about, a bit extra for emergencies and fun, education, and each other. We really do "have it all." That, to me, is the richest a person can be Our lives are different from other people because we have support. We know how to navigate bureaucracy. We have a safety net. We have people to fall back on. My siblings and I all lived together at one point or other even when we didn't "need to." Money can be stolen or dissolved or taken at any time. Wealth, however, never can. And that, to me, is worth milions	My uncle. He buys everything in cash: nice cars, expensive trips, expensive clothes. He has a couple of very nice homes that he had built for him and his family. He takes family out to nice dinners and trips. He has no debt and paid for all of his children to go to college. He came from poverty. He, my mom, and their siblings were raised by a single mother who often neglected them and allowed them to be abused by her boyfriends. He worked his ass off and earned his way through college, eventually starting his own business. There's not much different in the way he lives, aside from not worrying about money or whether he can afford something.
How old are you and what is the hardest life lesson you've learned so far?	26, male - you should take the chances when someone shows interest in you, and don't back off for petty reasons that you make up in your head. Try it out first, you can always say no afterwards, but not before you have tried it - actually that goes for many things (but don't do drugs or other illegal business).	24, sometimes you can do everything "right" in a friendship/relationship, and people will still not value you. Them not seeing your worth has nothing to do with you.
Women who work in computer science/IT, what's the most infuriating case of being professionally undervalued by coworkers for being a woman?	When other women assume I need "women in tech" groups and that I need them to help "advance" me. The men I have worked with have been nothing but respectful and have treated me no differently than they've treated each other. If anything they assume I'm smarter than I am. But when people--often women--assume I need all these programs and special help that men don't have in order to have a successful career, I find it insulting.	I've never dealt with it from coworkers, but clients on the other hand.. If I can't fix it right away it's because of my gender, if a guy can't it must be really broken. And just lots of variations of that.
Ladies in the dating world - does "Divorced" or "Never Married" make a difference to you?	Honestly at my age if you're divorced I put a line through your name on my mental list Never married is cool. I'm sure it depends who you ask though and their age or if they've bee divorced etc. I just feel like if you've married once and divorced you fucked up	I think the distinction could be useful because some people really don't want to deal with the potential baggage. Obviously not all divorces are the same but in general I would rather date someone who has not been married before. (However, not many people my age have been married and divorced, so.)

Pets in bed? Gross or wonderful and the right way to live?	Gross. Maybe it's because I was raised in the country and cats always stayed with the other farm animals, and the dogs in the barn or the wash room, but I think it's just fundimentally wrong to let your pet into your bed. I've softened with the years and I can tolerate pets inside the living room, bath and kitchen, but not in the bedroom, I feel it's filthy and destroys all pegging order in the family. But again, that's just me and undoubtedly has to do with me being raised in an environment where pets serve a purpose beyond companionship.	i have no problem with pets on the bed as long as they don't compromise my comfort. when the dog starts taking up too much space or kicks me while he's dreaming or whatever, he gets the boot.
How does one grapple with being unsure about having a child?	Dude you are 23. A lot of men don't want to be a father at 23. You are way too young.	If you don't want kids, then don't bring them into the world. That's a disservice to their future selves. Also, if you're in a LTR, you should definitely discuss this with your SO and see if that is a deal breaker.
What is "bad timing"? Do you believe "bad timing" can cause a relationship to fail or fail to start?	With the exception of some truly rare events (terrible illness, close person dying, forced to move a plane ride away) it's just an excuse.	Bad timing is totally a thing. "I just got a job across the country" "My mother is in the hospital dying of cancer" "I'm married" "I just lost my job" "I just started dating someone else" "I've only been out of the institution for a week"
What are your biggest dating regrets from your 20s?	I dated, and lost my virginity to, a disgusting obese girl who was extremely immature throughout my 20s because I lived in a backcountry redneck shithole of an area with almost no acceptable women. My biggest regret is staying there and wasting my prime years. I should have moved to an area of culture, intelligence, and fit women.	I met a wonderful woman who was wife material. Unfortunately, I was at that stage where I was interested in fucking around, and could not recognize it. She went on to marry a guy who was good for her. She deserved that happiness, and I'm glad she found it.
What's the most motivating thing anybody's ever said to you?	"coals are key." was in reference to learning how to start a fire from my dad when i was 11, but as i've grown older, i've applied it to other things, using less literally and more metaphorically. coals are key to a good fire, just as motivation/inspiration/etc are key to reaching your goals.	My brother always told me this one when we went running together, but it applies to a lot of things I've found: "When you get tired, you're exhausted and you want to stop, that is your limit. That's where you are now. Every step you take after that is improvement."
How do you measure intelligence in someone?	For me, if someone exhibits any of the following traits, I automatically assume they're an idiot... * Religious * Racist in any way, shape or form * Homophobic * Likes guns * Won't try any sort of food outside their comfort zone * Thought Final Fantasy XIII was a good game UPDATE: Thought of two more... * Watches college football and roots for a specific team, but in games not involving their team, just blindly roots for teams from a certain conference (i.e., "Sure, Ohio State isn't playing in this here bowl game, but I'm gonna root for Wisconsin because I'm a Big Ten fan!") * Went to Ohio State.	Intelligent people are critical of their thoughts, when they speak (casually, not making a speech) it's evident that they have taken other perspectives on the subject and the possible counter-arguments into consideration.
What surprising thing did you learn about a loved one after they passed away?	\[not a happy one\] That he had raped his two older daughters when they were single-digit age or thereabouts. I'm the only one of -my- generation in my family that knows; everyone in the generation before me knows.	When my grandma died we found out that she had bought rings when each of her children and grandchildren were born. The rings had their birthstones and she would wear the rings at every special event for that person. She did this so when she passed we would have something that reminded us of all the great memories we had with her instead of all the memories we would never make. We would be able to wear these rings and know she was with us. There are many pictures of her at my birth wearing my ring, at my heart surgery, my birthdays, my graduation, and no one thought anything of it because grandma looooved her jewelry.
What's the weirdest thing your pet does?	When I was little, I had a hamster who would try to run on the top of its wheel. Turned out it was aware of how to get out of its cage on paper, and was working to put it into practice. Eventually, it did. Got out of its cage and then broke its back falling off the dresser. But hey, he died free. That hamster's name? Harry. Harry Houdini.	My dog is not a morning person. So while I'm in the shower in the morning he will sad sing at me. "Arwoooo" "woooooowooooowoooo" Just sad songs. [He hates getting up lol](https://i.imgur.com/AST40zP.jpg). Bonus: [A photo of him not in the bathroom being a sad bum](https://i.imgur.com/7GHnXRe.jpg)
Would you let a girl sleep with you in the same room even if you have a girlfriend?	I've shared a bed with a girl friend a couple of times. If everyone is an adult and everyone is okay with it, what's the big deal?	Definitely, because I want to be able to predict the opening line of every domestic argument for the next ten years.
Your pet has a business trip over the weekend. What human care instructions do they leave for you?	Morning alarm at 3- by crashing against the bedroom door and playing nascar. Then you must sit on her chest and stare lovingly at her until she gets up to feed me.	You must sleep across her neck like a cat scarf. Even though it is summer. She will try to tell you she doesn’t like it, but that’s a lie.
I know this is a first-world problem but hear me out. What are the non-obvious upsides/downsides to being successful and just staying single your whole life?	Let me start by commending your willingness to take a good hard look at your life. I think it was Aristotle that said the “unexamined life was not worth living.” I’ve been married for 26 years and to say it hasn’t been easy would be a massive understatement. But, until a man learns to consider another person as higher than themselves (that is, voluntarily placing another’s needs and concerns as preeminent to their own,) there is something lacking in that man’s development to full masculine maturity.	I used to know a dentist that stayed single his whole life, and he's been retired for years now, but as a dentist he made good money. Since he was single he could take his vacation whenever he wanted, he'd go grand tour on a motorcycle with some old friends, he'd buy a kick ass audiophile set-up. He enjoyed vast freedom (as you probably do yourself). Some times I think he missed not having some children, but whenever his nieces and nephews came to visit, he always doted on them like they were his own. I guess that's where most people that chose to stay single might have regrets later. Besides not having kids, like some other people have said, it sometimes sucks that you don't have a partner that you can rely on for support, and generally have someone you trust around you.
You've been given the job of making a list of five things that mean someone "has their life together". What would those five things be?	1) Has a fitness regimen 2) Has a well-stocked kitchen with minimally processed foods 3) Has an understanding of where their assets are & what expenditures their budget allows 4) Is very rarely late for appointments 5) Says few negative things about others	1. Not be broke by their own doing. Some people are, unfortunately, poor, despite budgeting well, but I wouldn't say they don't have their life together because they are poor. 2. Being able to handle their own personal flaws. 3. Knowing their likes, dislikes and preferences and being mindful of those. 4. Doing whatever they can manage to do to be healthy (again, some people are just unfortunate). 5. Knowing what they want out of life, whatever that might be, and working actively as far as their limits allow towards it.
What are your immediate thoughts/assumptions when you see a girl with a crazy hair color?	Wow. I had no idea that people thought so much about how a woman wears her hair. I've got purple hair. I'm a grownup with a good job and a family. I also don't really give a single shit about what anyone else thinks about my appearance. I'm happy with me. This thread really opened my eyes though to how small minded and judgmental people can be. I really had no idea so many had such strong judgments held toward HAIR COLOUR. Will it stop me from wearing whatever colour I want in my hair? No.. Apparently it weeds out the assholes.	This question would be a lot more interesting if you also asked people their geographic location. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area; there's a slightly different culture than say, rural upstate NY. Oddly dyed hair means different things in different contexts, in my experience.
Moms of AskWomen, what are things that you thought would be difficult after having children but they're easier than you thought?	ITT: All of the things that are harder than I anticipated them being. Sleeping, shopping, homework, picky eaters... I can just keep going and going.	I was always afraid about going shopping with my son. I've heard other mothers complain about it. But with my son, sometimes I take him shopping so he quits messing up my house. Obviously this depends on the child, but he's good 95% of the time. I will let him play in the mall's play area for a bit but he's happy in his stroller looking at people. He's fine anywhere with carts: grocery stores, Walmart, Target etc. He willl just look around and happily kick his feet and laugh. Obviously, a different kid may act differently
Do you believe social media has normalized dramatic changes being done to yourself, such as a nose job or body changes? If so, has it affected you in any way?	I don't think it has "normalized" it, really. We still see hundreds of comments slamming women for having work done. We still see hundreds of people calling anyone with work done "fake." But I think it is helping us reach a point, that will not come any time soon, where plastic surgery is no longer a bad thing because women are becoming more honest about it. It has not affected me. Another woman's decision to have work done has nothing to do with me and I applaud all of the women who are not ashamed or hiding it.	I don’t know about the general population but I’ve certainly seen a lot of youtubers and instagram posters (who are already young and beautiful) getting Botox, fillers and other cosmetic procedures. It seems like it is pretty much expected for them at this point. It’s disconcerting.
Women who have dealt with sexual abuse, how long did it take you to be comfortable being intimate again?	I am in my 30s and I am working through this. My husband is very kind, patient, selfless, and always wants to please me, so that helps. Also knowing that sex is not a dirty thing, and that in God's eyes it is a beautiful and holy thing between a man and a woman. The sensations are natural and pure, not something to be afraid or ashamed of.	im more comfortable then I was, but I'm still not completely comfortable. but then again 2020 was the first year i wasn't raped since 2014 so I guess time will tell.
Eggnog or nah?	I think it's nasty. I think it smells bad and tastes worse. I think coffee and tea are nice year round but especially in cold weather. I also like the occasional hot chocolate or mulled wine around Christmas time	Fuck yes eggnog! I make it with much less sugar than the recipe calls for and double up on the bourbon. And it must be cold. Warm eggnog is an abomination.
What love story, whether real or fictional, seemed romantic to you at one time but now just seems creepy and/or wrong?	I don't personally agree with this, but a lot of people are outraged about what they consider the rapey nature of the premise for "Passengers". Personally, I liked it and thought it was a solid love story...in the end.	Pretty much every romantic plot line in every teen drama, ever. Kids, you're 15/16 years old. This insane co-dependant lunacy you have going on is good for neither of you. I know it seems, like, SO ROMANTIC but it's not. It's usually kind of obsessive/creepy/manipulative/straight up abusive.
Is there a right to be annoyed if a partners attention is on their phone when you two are alone?	Weird, when I only have 10 min left of getting ready and leaving, I just kind of hope he stays out of my way. So him sitting down w/ his phone seems ideal.	For me it's not just partners but people in general, Nothing pisses me off more when I'm talking to someone and they start playing on their phone.
What do you consider "too far" when your fiancé has their bachelor party?	Touching and kissing. I understand they may wanna see stripers and have lap dance but keep your hands to yourself. Maybe a boob grab. MAYBE. If he really thought he needed it but no kissing and no genital touching.	The same things I'd consider "too far" on any other day of the week. It's a party, not a hall pass to be an asshole - new boundaries shouldn't have to be created for a bachelor/bachelorette party alternate universe. Be safe with yourself and others, no cheating based on what's already been established as personal boundaries in the relationship.

Would you want to get the baby you gave birth to back or would you keep raising the child that you currently have?	**Reminders:** * **If you are not answering the actual question asked by OP, you are derailing and your comment will be removed.

When you pee without holding your penis, does it go wild like a hose or does it just kind of stay still in one place?	This is the power of foreskin. It acts as a counter weight to the piss pressure and allows for hands free peeing. Anyone who says circumcision isn't child abuse has clearly never enjoyed this privilege	Trajectory changes with flow A constant stream stays steady, but starting and ending a piss cause movement; usually in the up/down direction but it can get wild
How would you feel if a woman asked for an STI test on the second date?	I would move on; out of all of the women I've been with, no one has asked for one. I'm just honest with them and tell them the truth as they are with me. Asking for a test is not the norm in today's culture and it would inconvenience me more to have it done than not.	At first it would be weird. Then I would imagine reasons why she would ask that and conclude that she would like to fuck. Which leads to me agreeing to take a test if she does the same. Let's go do the tests together why not?
What do you think of getting birth defect testing done when pregnant?	I married and had children late but I did not have any tests because I knew I wouldn't terminate, no matter what. That was my chance at being a mom - which I really wanted. Every person has a right to make their own decisions about their own lives, I respect that 100%. I know would have loved that child no matter what. I would like to foster older kids now. I already am a safe haven for some friends of my kids. I always have a bed, a ride or a meal ready for them when they need them.	Some people focus on the possibility that the parents will want to terminate (or give the child up for adoption) but there are other valid reasons to want the information sooner than birth. It could affect where you choose to deliver the baby, for example (especially if you anticipate the baby will need immediate and specialized care right after birth). Some treatment may even start before birth. It also gives you time to prepare, mentally, financially, etc. I have a cousin with Down Syndrome and many of my aunt & uncle's major financial and career decisions have been with his needs in mind (for example, living where they'll have a good support system and he can access high-quality services). There are certainly families who could benefit from knowing about things ASAP.
What dating tips are men taught about women that don't hold true in your experience?	The idea that cold approaches work if your "technique" is good enough. No. Some of us are not receptive to cold approaches at all, ever. Rape culture is too real a fear, so try changing that before complaining that women aren't receptive to cold calls. Stranger danger.	Anything about three day rules or not calling right away because you'll seem too eager. No, don't call me every fifteen minutes. Yes, you can call me the day after -- it indicates you had fun and want to get together again. If you wait 3 or 5 or whatever the latest bullshit number of acceptable days is, I'll assume you're not that interested.
Do you know guys who feel entitled to hot women - despite not doing anything to make themselves look appealing/presentable?	This is a bad idea...this is a bad idea...this is a bad idea... But yes, I do, but I also know many women like that. Women who want guys to like them for their souls while they, themselves, do absolutely nothing for their appearance. This isn't a gendered issue as much as it is a human issue. These people don't understand that most people who *try* to be attractive, somehow succeed to a certain extent. It's extremely rare for someone to be SO unattractive, that nothing in the world could ever make them attractive. On top of that, thinking you're *entitled* to anyone is a very dangerous mindset to find yourself in.	Yeah I know a ton of guys like that. They aren't as bad as you described- just basic average dudes who have no personality, no hobbies, look like every other guy out there, think that meeting basic human standard entitles them to hot girls who are freaky in bed with no sexual partners before him who meet a million other criteria as well.
What has your ex ruined for you?	video games - I don't play, but I will never ever date a guy who plays video games as a hobby.	People named Kevin. My first two exes were both named Kevin. Now I just feel immediately and unfairly suspicious of people I meet named Kevin.
What is the stupidest turn off ?	I wouldn't date anyone who isn't passionate about music. And when I say passionate, I mean literally obsessed with music and knows all the ins and outs of their favourite genres. I don't mean to sound snobbish or anything but I can't bring myself to be interested in people who "just listen to whatever".	noncommital answers to my questions. We're on a first date and I'm trying to get to know you and you're answering my questions with "I dunno" or some equivalent. I went on a date with a woman, she was a journalism professor who had previously worked as a journalist and been in many countries and cities but every questions about her travels was met with answers that would make you think she grew up in Mayberry and had never left there.
HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THE PATRIARCHY?	I am a wereshitlord. When the moon is empty, I undergo a hideous transformation and stalk the night as a terrifying unholy monster. I dogcall women, I spread my legs on public transportation as widely as possible, I buy women drinks and then demand sex as recourse, I question women wearing video game shirts if they even know anything about the game theyre wearing, and I ask every woman in my line of sight out on a date, and when they respond even remotely negatively I howl in rage! The morning after I always find myself in jail, and with at least 6 new restraining orders. All sweaty, clothes torn, bruises, scratches from nails, and smelling strongly of mace. It is a terrible curse.	I HAVE CONSENSUAL SEX WITH MY GIRLFRIEND IN A NON-PLATONIC MANNER IN WHICH I CLEARLY OBJECTIFY HER BY CONSENSUALLY SEXING HER
ladies, what's the first sign of pregnancy that you've had? ( the earliest one ) and how far along were you?	Missed my period. Took a test and found out I was pregnant. Less than 2 weeks...the embryo hadn't even implanted or whatever yet. So glad I found out right away.	I'm a horse trainer, both my pregnancies the first sign was my horses/client horses all started acting weird around me like a week before my missed period. Sweetest ancient old pony suddenly lunging for my arm if I tried to touch him, huge asshole ex-bronc being super gentle and respectful, my partially blind mare who literally anyone can ride wouldn't let me touch her face, etc. In terms of my body, nausea and sore boobs around six weeks.
What's the weirdest thing that an ex has done after the two of you broke up?	She hand delivered a sad, soppy love letter and a hand-drawn Archer comic to my house while I was at work. My mum opened it and laughed.	Tried to get me excommunicated from the Catholic church. I'm an atheist and was raised in a Lutheran family, so I'm not sure what this was supposed to accomplish.
What do you wish people would stop joking about?	We are already wound too tight as a society. Everyone should lighten up and quit taking shit so seriously. I think people should joke more and about more things.	I think anything can potentially be joked about, but it requires an amount of finesse that most people don't have. At any rate, above all, people should just know their audience.
Why do some people feel threatened by other people’s”Safe Spaces”?	I completely disagree with the idea of safe spaces, but I am not threatened by them. These seem to be common at colleges (only place I have heard of them). We are supposed to be preparing these young adults for the real world. And there are no safe spaces in the real world. Instead, what we are teaching them is that rather than develop your own convictions in who you are and what you believe, you should just run away to your safe space whenever somebody says something that you can't handle. The very idea that a stranger's words can evoke an emotional response that you can't control is a serious problem (for you) and needs to be addressed. And I think you will live a happier and healthier life once you learn to do this.	I think it makes some people deeply uncomfortable to hear that someone's rape was so bad they can't read about it, or seeing graphic photos depicting any sort of violence or gore on campus can send someone to an emotionally dangerous place. I think some people can't understand, and think these people want to live in cloud la la land where they won't ever have to see these things again, but as we all know that's not accurate. I also think seeing emotional vulnerability to that degree and that public unnerves some people to the point they just feel anger or disgust.
Ladies of Reddit. "I'm not high maintenance, you're just low effort" is a popular phrase currently. How would you describe high maintenance/low effort? What qualities would you say describes both?	High maintenance is a way for people to minimise women's needs and a way to criticize women for expressing needs.	Perspective. Being high maintenance means you require a lot of maintenance from other people. Anyone of any gender can be high maintenance. It is most often used with a misogynist overlay of "woman who takes excellent care of herself and has high expectations for luxuries in her life." The idea is that you expect more than the average partner. Being low effort means that you don't expend a lot of energy to anyone outside yourself. Anyone of any gender can be low effort. The idea is that you offer less than the average partner.
Men who use or have used steroids - whats it like?	I've never used steroids, but my dad did for a while when he was in college and he's told me about some of the experience. From what I remember, he said it took a few times dosing to take effect, but he said when he lifted for the first time after taking them, his usual warm up weight on bench press -- 135 pounds -- felt "like a feather" when he lifted it off the rack. He said he banged out like 20 reps instantly and then went on to achieve his personal max at the time.	It helped me recover from the weirdest medical issue I've ever had. So hey, kudos to steroids for de-paralysing my freaking face.
Intersectionality: How are men oppressed in our society?	Short answer: Men are not opressed. That however doesn't mean that there are issies that exclusively plauge men and those need to be adressed.	I think men are expected to take anything a woman throws at them, no matter how horrible it might be. But if the roles were reversed, society would expect women to react immediately at the first sign of "abuse" followed up with swift justice. I get it, women have gone through a lot and I hate it when I hear stories of abuse towards women, but it happens to men too and society needs to realize it's a lot more serious than they realize.
Women who have been cheated on in previous relationships, how do you keep the anxiety of it happening in your new relationships away?	Since my ex I now use 'plates'(i.e. fuck buddies). I no longer care if any of those 'plates' cheat. Because it's an open relationship.	That if someone is shitty enough and they want to cheat, they're going to do it. It doesn't matter how good of a partner or how worried I am, or whether I try to prevent it, and at this point in my life that's not something I want to waste my energy on. I shouldn't have to police my partner's behavior to keep them from cheating on me or making me suspicious that they might, and if I did, they wouldn't be right for me anyways.
What are your 5 non-negotiables when it comes to finding "the one"?	* Be patient * Be very liberal * Not be money driven (ideally lower-middle to middle class social standing, too) * Be laid back but still passionate about something * Want children	* Have passions in life. * Be patient and no short fuse. * Be open minded to new ideas and new things * Be a good human being, not just be good to me but to oneself and others. * Be able to communicate with me well.
What is your favorite instance/story of "she's just being nice" that you (or with the "help" of a friend) later realized was undeniably strong signals of courtship and desire for higher levels of intimacy?	ITT: Every stereotype justified about how all women are fucking cowards who can't do anything but "drop hints" and how every man is wiling to fuck any willing woman ever.	We had just gotten high and were staring into each others eyes and I dunno what I thought at the time I was just laughing because I was high. I then moved away shortly thereafter and she texted me "how come we didn't fuck?" and it was around then that I realized...I was on the spectrum
What has been your biggest "fuck you /r/askmen" moment?	Recently the thread about the girl who pretended to be a British tourist and had sex with a guy. Everyone was acting like "that's so terrible you did something awful". What's the big fucking deal?	This sub has a habit of someone asking a question, then downvoting all answers that are honest. For example, a girl will ask, "do men really care what a girls nipples look like?" and everyone who answers, "No all women's nipples are beautiful." while anyone who says they do in fact prefer one kind or type over another gets blasted...
What do you guys say when your girl says she's "fat"?	This is a red flag. There's no right response, because if she does in fact feel this way, then she needs to address the root cause, and you can't do that for her. If she's saying it just to see what you'll do, she's being manipulative. Neither is a sign that predicts a relationship where you won't (a) be constantly providing validation so that she can avoid dealing with her own issues, or (b) being manipulated. Talk to the girl about how you feel. If it doesn't stop, think about moving on.	My wife and I are pretty honest with one another. Sometimes, we gain a bit of weight (she will gain up to 8 lbs at most). So, when she says that she's getting fat, I reassure her that she's still hot (because she is) and that, if she wants, I'll help her drop some of it. I do most of the cooking and I'll motivate her to go on more runs/walks, so I can help in some small ways. In any case, I don't think it's anything to get upset about unless she does it all the time without taking action. If she's gaining, it's not hard to make a couple of lifestyle changes and reverse the process (assuming she is smaller and doesn't have issues with her weight already).
What was the most misguided piece of advice a man has ever given you?	I had many a male mentor tell me when I was younger that I would have to work harder than my male counterparts to reach the same goals. That's a blatant lie. I work just as hard as anyone else, have my times when I slack off, and have reached the exact same goals. My Vagina doesn't make my life an uphill battle and your penis doesn't make you any more of a millionaire.	"Don't watch sports? You should at least watch watch Sports Center so you have something to talk to men about." I find it hilarious now, but at the time I was stunned. Why would I waste an hour every day on something I don't care about to present a false interest to men? Now I have a partner with an equal disinterest in sports. It's perfect.
Has birth control affected your personality?	It depends on the pill for me. I was on Gianvi (generic version of Yaz) and the only personality side effect it had on me was that I would cry much easier/frequently if I was sad or upset. Overall, it wasn't as bad as it may sound. In January-March of this year, my pharmacist changed my prescription to a different Yaz generic (Loryna) and I turned into a completely different person: raging anger, hysterical crying, suicidal thoughts, the whole gamut. I don't know why two different generics of the same brand name pill gave me such wildly different reactions but within a week or two of stopping Loryna, I felt like a human being again.	It messes with my mood. It's a lot easier to set me off now. I haven't felt this moody since I was 16:\ A week before my period I get really emotional and everything upsets me. Two weeks ago it was my birthday and I was about to start it. I cried because my boyfriend got me cookies and I already had cookies... EDIT: I'd also like to add that it killed my sex drive. Sex is still fun, but I always feel really "meh" about it beforehand.
What's the dumbest thing someone has called the cops on you for?	We had the cops called on us because it was Christmas day and my entire family was drunkenly playing baseball in the hallway of the hotel we were at and my uncle was being really belligerent to the hotel manager when he asked us to stop.	A guy who backed into a dumpster at an apartment complex called the cops and claimed I backed into his car and then ran off. As soon as I showed up, the cop dismissed it as I had no damage to the bumper of my vehicle, nor any paint scraped on it. Also, the paint scraped on his car was blue (matching the dumpster) and my vehicle was brown. It was also a pickup truck, where as his car was an older toyota, and due to the height of my vehicle, it was impossible that I would have hit him where he claimed I did, as the point of impact would be much higher.
What do you think of open relationships?	I had a few when in college and it was awesome. I stopped because I didn't think you could raise kids like that so married someone very vanilla now wish it was open. Just decide what works best for you	Some people enter them too readily, without proper communication and planning, maybe as a desperate attempt to save a relationship. These will not work. Some people will refuse to be in anything else and hate on monogamous people or bang on about what's natural and what isn't. These people are not nice people. Some people simply prefer a life of polygamy or polyandry, are open and honest about this, and will form many successful and long lasting relationships. These are the people who will succeed. Personally I don't think it's for me. I think I would simply get too jelous and insecure, and I enjoy the exclusivity that being with one person brings. And that's okay too.
Have you dated a younger guy? If so, what was the age difference. How was the relationship?	My ex fiance was 6 years older in age, but some days seemed like he was younger than me in emotional maturity and mentality. I also had an FWB who was 9 years younger than me and while I thought everything was on an even keel, it wasn't and I had to stop seeing him because he was having a hard time understanding why not all FWB arrangements don't transition to relationships. :/ Most of the guys since have been no more than 4 years older/younger than me. I'm 32, and it seems like a comfortable distance right now. Maturity wise, I get along, but in terms of life goals I'm just not always in the same place and that's the bigger make or break than a birthday.	I've almost always dated younger guys, though that was by accident, not planning. If it's just a couple of years difference, it's no big deal - were essentially peers. I dated a guy for 2 years that was a little over a decade younger, with me in my mid-40s and him in his early 30s. That was fine, but in many ways we broke up because I needed him to be just a bit more of a grown up than he was.
Ladies who read the label before buying a product: what ingredients/substances, both in food and cosmetics, do you refuse to buy?	I can't eat MSG, artificial colors, or almonds. Other than that I aim to keep me carb count low, I'm sensitive to sugars.	Anything with palm oil. I know there is sustainable palm oil but I still won't buy it. I prefer vegan items but I know that some of my all time favourite products do contain animal products.
Are you currently dating a man shorter than you? What's it like?	My ex was three inches shorter than me (I'm 5'10). It was fine when we kissed and the sex was good too, but next time around I'm definitely sticking to my rule of dating a guy either my height or taller than me. The taller, the better.	I just went on a first date with a guy that was shorter than me. I also was in heels. Other than the initial observation ("Oh, he's on the shorter side!") I didn't really notice much. He was attractive, he was interesting - height is generally not something I dwell on much.
My last boyfriend told me that I am a bit immature and annoying. I don't agree, but hey, I could be wrong. Ladies, what are characteristics of mature, non-annoying, responsible adult women?	This thread is basically an example of the immaturity. Who turns to the Internet for personality advice? We don't know you, and don't know your ex. I think it's immature that you would ask randoms on Reddit for input where we obviously have zero expertise. But hey, I could be wrong.	Mature: You keep your promises, or apologize sincerely if you don't. You don't lie. You don't try to "cute" your way out of trouble. You generally take care of yourself and don't expect someone else to clean up after you (either physically or emotionally). You understand that your actions have consequences and deal with those. You can productively spend time by yourself. You don't "need" to be in a relationship or company all the time.
Instead of the worst or scariest, what are some "meh" or "so-so" dates you've been on?	I went on a couple dates with someone in a wheel chair once. The guy was super nice and super handsome, good family and everything. He was super fun too, and the wheelchair didn't phase me. But the spark just wasn't there. He was absolutely amazing though, whichever lucky lady ends up with him, God bless. You're in very good hands.	Asking questions like pulling teeth. I'd ask what he liked to do, or what his job was, or what sort of food he liked. 1 word / 1 sentence answers.
Women of Gonewild...why do YOU do it?	Not my thing, but you might go ask the guys of LadyBonersGW too (i.e. it's not just women who do this).	At first it was because someone threatened to leak my pictures, so I beat him to the punch. Then I realized it turns me on to know other people are turned on by me.
Women who have had a baby- is it as awful and horrifying as all of the stories?	Dude I'm scared of having a kid too, all the stories I've heard are awful, like how I've heard it's common to shit yourself while giving birth, and your man who thinks he's witnessing the miracle of life has to watch that?! Or I've heard it's common the tissue between vag and butt tears ?!!!! Fuck that. I'd rather just kidnap someone else's kid and raise it as my own. Kidnapping is easier than dropping a baby	This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this user&apos;s privacy.

What's your favorite thing to think about when you are looking at the stars?	That we are looking back in time. It's the closest we'll get to a time machine, looking at these massive nuclear explosions light years away. The cosmic landscape probably does not resemble what we see anymore. It's like looking at a plane of space frozen momentarily in time. Also the fact that we are composed of starstuff that eventually developed into a complex form of life that could one day look up, capture a little bit of that starlight in our eyes... and marvel. Skygazing is massively underrated.	I wonder if on another planet in another solar system, an alien is looking at the faint light of our very own star. I think about my past and how tiny we are compared to the universe. I also think about how peaceful it is.
Guys who used to think too much instead of taking action, how did you become strong?	Get some determination and stop being a pussy that relies only on motivation. Motivation is fickle, the only thing that is reliable is determination. Stop whining on Reddit and actually take daily steps to improve your life even if they are small.	I'm still at my first job I got in high school and I'm 23. Some of my friends have already gotten married, own homes, are making money in their careers. It feels bad but I try to feel happy for them instead of being jealous. My time will come one day.
How often do you orgasm simultaneously with whomever you're having sex with?	I'd put it at 95%+ of the time. My orgasm is almost entirely controlled by hers, I have a very hard time getting off during sex if she doesn't orgasm at the same time. Thankfully there's plenty of opportunity since she is multi-orgasmic.	Pretty much never, my current partner and I have been together for 2+ years and I think it has happened twice? Those times were amazing but I don't really get off from piv, so it's just not expected.
Ladies of color, what's been harder to deal with throughout your life: racism or sexism?	Sexism because I'm female in a male dominated career I suppose and I don't look tough even though I am. I'm white though so I suppose that's why I haven't ever really experienced racism and as I am an atheist being 'technically jewish' never really comes up, and when it does there has been some insults. However neither has ever gotten to me, racism and sexism is a part of life for me and I just laugh it off (or punch the person and then laugh it off) Why take it seriously?	Both equally, but I actually found that when I was heavier THAT was actually way worse, if that makes a difference at all. I've had my fair share of anti-Hispanic racism and sexism for being a woman, but nothing ever really compared to what I got for being overweight when I was overweight.
My fellow pad wearers- are you sick of other ladies telling you that you need to use some other kind of period protection? Just me?	It's likely that they think poorly of pads because they haven't tried many. They probably only had experience with those disgusting and terrible disposable ones, that come unstuck from the underwear and get stuck to the thighs, pants, and pubic hair, and also always smell terrible. They probably haven't tried the cloth pads that are fleece-lined, have have a charcoal layer, and fasten with a clip, or the panties that have pads built right in. That said, if you can feel your diva cup, you're probably doing something very wrong. A lot of people don't read the directions.	Yes! I've had so many women tease me about wearing a pad,some of them calling me a "grandma" or making jokes about how I must not be able to take a dick. So now I have some pads in my car and my purse at all times so I never have to ask anyone if they have one. EDIT: Wow so many replies! You guys are all so sweet. Just wanted to say,that dick comment came from a drunk girl at a bar so it wasn't really that big of a deal but still,very rude. And yes,people are ignorant and feel like they have the right to comment of your personal preferences but like I said I just keep my pads on me at all times so I never have to listen to another stupid remark.
What are the worst things about an office job?	I just busted my balls working outside all day dealing with dickheads, and you pansies are complaining about a few meetings and some minor shoulder pain? Take a stretch and revel that you are shielded from weather and grinding physical work, not to mention the various health hazards.	Meetings Pointless bullshit HR compliance tasks Sitting in front of a computer for 8 hrs Shitty colleagues That's about everything haha
What advice would you give your younger self prior to first breakup?	Girl here. Don’t send him nudes. They’ll end up being distributed to about 1200 people over the course of the next two years. He is not worth it. Don’t let him ruin your life.	This will make you into such a better person. It will be a long emotionally brutal recovery but you will be happy with the person that comes out of it!
What changes instantly as soon as you get married?	Your ability to call things off with minimal fall out if you get to a point where you don't want to be with her anymore.	Your relationship is suddenly much more respected by the general public, customer service, etc. Saying "I need to check with my wife first" has much more gravitas than "I need to check with my girlfriend".
Older Women in STEM, do you feel a change of attitude towards women in STEM?	Male student here, but from what I've heard from my female colleagues the real gauntlet is the academic world. Treatment of white collar female workers in the business world has improved greatly, particularly in STEM fields. The job market for female STEM workers is very robust, but many university departments are still good ol' boy networks which are stuck decades behind the times.	I'm a female STEM student currently in chemistry. I've found in my internships there's usually equal amounts of both genders if not more women. That being said I have encountered some individualized sexism from coworkers. For example we had a post-doc ask us why we spent so much time in lab and didn't go out to the bar looking for husbands. But I feel like that has more to do with that guys individual beliefs than STEM as a whole. Also had a male coworker touch my waist inappropriately in lab and asked me if I wanted to babysit his daughters (I already have a 40 hr/week job that pays well). It's just small things like that but overall the field has been pretty fair/equal in my experience.
What are some signs that someone is emotionally unavailable?	I say I’m emotionally unavailable in poor taste I think, then. When I say I’m emotionally unavailable it’s not that I don’t WANT another person, it’s that the turmoil of my past says I’m not in a position to be in a relationship. But the need for socialization, affection and a stimulating connection constantly out weighs it. As much as I’ve been hurt , affection will always be a craving. When I say I’m “Emotionally unavailable” I pretty much mean “I appreciate your efforts and I find you charming but I currently can’t trust another human being in a romantic situation.” Then they try anyways, and I get hurt. What can you do? 🤷🏼‍♀️	A person who is emotionally unavailable does not share their emotions with others, pretends not to have emotions, and makes no effort to understand the emotions of others. If someone is truly emotionally unavailable they may desire a relationship, but they will find it difficult to begin one and almost impossible to maintain one.
What little thing annoys you much more than it reasonably should?	Counting calories -- why can't you just eat what's healthy for you? Your body already has a way of telling you when you've had too much. It's called FULL! I know I should be happy for people who are trying to be healthier, but it kinda irks me. It seems like the easy way out. I could eat 2000 calories of delicious microwave pizza rolls and pringles and that doesn't mean I'm much better off! You don't even have to be rich to eat better foods, just cook or buy things not canned or packaged.	When people respond with an insult like "sheep." Don't address why they disagree. Don't state any alternative evidence. Don't even say they disagree - just immediately name call. It's so gross.
Ladies, is there something that you need to get off your chest? If so, what is it?	I don't have anything I need to get off my chest as I tend to say what I want when I want. One thing I haven't said yet as it is not the time I plan to is that I'm beginning to tire of my bf and will be replacing him with someone younger, hotter, and makes more money. I'm just waiting for me to get all his network contacts for my own use.	My mom passed away a few weeks ago and this past week my boyfriend of three years broke up with me. He cut off all contact with me and won't respond to any of my calls/letters. He said he didn't want to have to be there for me emotionally during this time because he needed to focus on himself. The only one who could make things better would have been my mom. Life is fucking unfair.
What's the funniest or most interesting conversation you've ever overheard?	One kid to another kid at the supermarket. "Have you ever eaten chicken feet?!" Heard it the other day as I walked right by them. XD	Overheard my professor and a classmate talking the other day. Professor: Oh you used to be a hooker?? Student: Yeah! When I was a lot skinnier though haha. Professor: That's great! I was a hooker in high school! Turns out they were talking about rugby. Woops.
Your SO sends you nudes that she had taken for a man in her past. How do you react?	> her reasoning is because she thinks she looked better back then I think if she thinks that, she needs to hit the gym.	"I want OC, you faggot." I wouldn't care. Unless his name is written on her chest in whipped creme, it's all the same. Maybe put in some special requests if you want something new.
How do you feel during intimate medical exams?	Personally, I hated being examined yearly. That last time, she was testing me there and I had a orgasm. I just felt extremely uncomfortable.	Yes - I'm sure there is some sort of law that states that "The more embarrassing the medical condition/procedure, the probability of encountering an attractive nurse who does the most awkward part of the diagnosis/procedure approaches 1" If it doesn't exist yet, it should and it will henceforth be known as /u/UghWhyDude's law of medical awkwardness.
Do you guys have a bed frame?	It makes me wonder what the rest of your place looks like. It also makes me wonder what your life is like. You probably need to expand your Horizons. There is more to life than what your routine is currently. Learn to appreciate furniture, cooking, camping, something else...before it passes you by. You might want these things later in life and realize the time has gone. You are 26, you're older than you think. Good luck, and change up your stuff.	Trashy is a little much but it is an incomplete setup. It screams bachelor but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Have you ever met a man that could be described as "high maintenence"? What was he like?	As a dude who is high maintenance how do I stop being? Lack of experience in everything (from dating (cannot get past the second date to sex (never had))) some trama and a shitty social upbringing has made me like this and very insecure. I'm approaching my mid 20s and it never ends.	YUP. He took more time than me getting ready, but that's not what I am talking about -- I will never hate on someone taking care of their physical appearance. You do you! But he was very, very emotionally high maintenance. He needed constant reassurance that I was really into him. He got weird if I didn't text him daily to check in (yet always expected me to text him first?). He needed constant verbal validation. Like, he would take me out to dinner but then while we were at dinner talk consistently about how nice and expensive the restaurant was if I didn't remark on those things first. And I was young, so I gave him what he asked for without asking for the same things in return and without breaking down the emotional toll that his requests took on me.
What are your best frugal living hacks?	What I personally do Try to cut back on spending money for all things that don't make you happier. In holidays/with friends I don't care about money at all, it's amazing to share a great evening with steak&beers... Don't pay for public transport, chances of getting caught are ridiculously small and tickets are expensive. Don't eat out unless it's with friends. Sandwiches for lunch. Only eat meat when it's 50% off No mobile internet/cheap phone no TV (internet works just as well) Buy a Kindle/ebook reader. You can get basically all books for free online.	Learn how to sew so you can repair clothes you already have instead of buying new ones if something develops a tear or a hole. Frozen vegetables and fruit have the same nutritional value but last longer and are generally a lot cheaper.
Got any suggestions for meals or snacks that are very healthy and very delicious?	Tzatziki and pita bread. - Drain plain yogurt (my favorite is Stonyfield) for a few hours, or use Greek yogurt. - Put the yogurt in a bowel when done straining. - Grade up an entire cucumber. Put all the cucumber in the yogurt. - Mix in some olive oil. - If you have any, put in some fresh mint. Enjoy!	My favorite: Take your favorite yogurt (some really good stuff..for me it's usually greek) and make an icing bag to dispense little pieces of yogurt on wax paper. Freeze them. The next day I have yogurt bites. Yum.
Has your boss ever told you to wear makeup?	I don't know. Work performance isn't the only thing that matters in a professional environment. Dressing and looking professional are also a part of the job. A bare face isn't necessarily unprofessional, but if you put two women next to each other dressed the exact same way, the one wearing makeup would look more professional.	Nope and I very rarely wear any to work (only if for a big meeting/interview where I'm dressed up in a suit instead of my usual business casual.) If anyone ever told me to wear makeup, I would be very upset. Unless wearing makeup becomes the norm for both genders and is thus expected of everyone at my place of work, it is unfair to focus on women as needing to take the extra time out of their day to put on makeup to conform to a societal sense of beauty.
How awkward was the first time you bought condoms?	I was 16. I approached the cashier and handed her the condoms. She said "I think you have to be 18 to buy those." I said "you need to be 18 to practice safe sex?" 5 second awkward pause, after which she flushed a bright red and just rang them up, took the money, gave me the change and receipt, and didn't say another word as I picked up the bag and left.	What you said is waaaaaay more awkward than buying condoms. What uncle sends his nephew into the store to buy condoms for him?
Ladies who live with your SO and pay rent, how do you divvy it up if you earn significantly less than he / she does?	If you are in a relationship with someone to the point of living together, IMO money becomes communal. We've had a joint account since before we were married or lived together.	Well, I can answer for utilities. We pay a percentage of them equal to our income. So like, if our total income is 100%, I make 70% of the household income and he makes 30%. So he pays 30% of the utilities.
I once pulled a knife on a guy to get him to back off me. What's the craziest thing you've done after saying 'no' didn't work?	When I was a kid, out to recess with my buddies, We had one table we all liked to sit at. One of my friends thought it would be funny to lay across the bench and take up 3 spaces. Being a kid, I told him 'move, or I'll shit on you.' He looked at me like 'yeah, right.' I decided it was time to nut the fuck up, I pulled my pants down just past my ass, and squatted over his face. Just as the turtle started poking his head out, he screamed and got up. My butthole puckered and retrieved my shit. Guy never doubted me again	Yesterday I got out of a cab when he was stopped at a red light. He kept asking me for my number, made me take his number and repeat it to him, tried to force me to call his number from my phone. Asked me where I lived, where I worked, said that, "we can be friends, right? We should be friends." Insisted I should call him if anyone ever threatens to hurt me (??). I tried to call someone on my phone so he would stop speaking to me but he just kept asking me to hang up so at a red light I left him a ten and got out of the car. He followed me in the cab for a block or so, so I went into a bank and he drove away. UGH.
Bisexual men, what are the differences between dating men and women in your experience?	Bi women here, in my limited experience I have not encountered too many duiferences in the dating process itself. Maybe that women have been more open in discussing relationship stuff, talk to test waters and to tell about any expectations and problems.And in the hooking up itself, men tend to be more "agressive" and the sex rougher, while with women it's more equal footed, more sensual and rithmic, also lasts more time since it's more fluid with a lot of ups and downs instead of a build up and done. Also I've enountered waaaay more women than men who enjoy going down a lot, for long and multiple times... (oh damn, had an awesome date yesterday and I'm having tingly flashbacks now)	Guys tend to be more straightforward with their intentions. They're also slightly hornier. Girls tend to hide it or do mixed signals. Girls are generally more affectionate and sweet. Also, the presence of a penis or vagina.
Do you ever find yourself lying in bed unable to fall asleep because there are too many things on your mind? If so, what is it that makes you ponder?	Yes. I experience hypervigilance a lot. Occasionally I take a sleeping pill but I find that the nerves overcome the sleeping pill and then I am just groggy as well as stressed. Mainly during this time I try NOT to let the thoughts come to mind that keep me stressed and awake; that bother me. So I’ll read instead.	I frequently lay in bed and agonize over stupid shit I've done. Or I get too excited about fun things coming up that I can't sleep.
Porno pet peeves / How can porn be improved?	I find most modern porn unnecessarily humanizes women and fails to properly out them in their place like the stupid little pieces of ass that they are. And stop coddling them, they aren't made of glass. I see DVDA and I'm like, pffft, cut the act sweetheart, you could totally fit another dick in there. Also, the dicks are too small. How am I supposed to imagine myself in there looking at this micropeen that could barely fill up a bread bag? It's not "deep throat" if you don't get acid burns on the tip, just sayin'. Sigh... It's reddit so I guess I better go ahead and ... /s.	Personally I would like more sensual blowjobs. Don't gag on that dick, worship it. Also, I would like things to be taken slower or at a more natural pace. Dave Jones does this really well. Also, also, I would like one damn MFF threesome where one of the woman is the focus and they get her off multiple times and then done. I don't know, I think this would be great.
When people discuss relationship stuff on Reddit, what sort of stuff when you read it makes you feel like you’re taking crazy pills?	How many people are so quick to say "break up with them" as though that decision carries no weight. Not that there are situations where people should break up such as abuse Cheating, etc. How little people encourage others to work on themselves and their relationship. (Not in every case) but I think it's very frequent to see an issue that can be fixed through counseling and people say to just give up.	There was a post on here recently asking what thing is impressive to see when going over to a potential partner's home for the first time and most of the answers were some variation of a guy with a clean home/bathroom.
Guys with female best friends, what's your relationship like?	I had a really good female friend with whom I hung out with frequently. > How much do you tell her? Tell her what? > Do you get graphic or detailed about sex ... Never > or romantic relationships? Never graphic, but I can get detailed. > Do you ever get physical/hook up every once in awhile? Nope	Never ever hook up, doesn't cross the mind. Share everything just about, like a buddy I tell everything too but a girl.
Have you been belittled by someone and proved them wrong immediately?	Some girl laughed and called me fat when I got my BMI done. The couch/gym person said she could go next since she acted like she would do better. Turns out my fat % was significantly lower, I was just very muscular. I also had large breasts, which she had none. The couch told me great job and told her she needed to start lifting weights, or just move more, as she had no muscle mass, just fat. She was not happy, and the rest of the group just snickered. I was still too embarassed from her comment to enjoy it until later and basically just sat there. Tldr: Skinny fat girl calls athletic me fat, gets scientifically put in her place.	There are other things I can't recall now, but a common thing for me is being told people under 18 aren't allowed to ____ and getting to pull out the ID that says I'm 22. Baby face problems...
When you go to hang up the phone after talking to your dad, do you exchange an "I love you"?	Never in my life. Since I was 12 or so, I don't even greet my parents. No reason to do it.	We didn't for the longest time. But then, despite him being in very good health, I started saying it when he was around 62-63; because, well, you never know which conversation is going to be the last. We continued that for several years and then one day last June, at 69 and still apparently very healthy, he dropped dead from a pulmonary embollism. I don't really remember the last conversation with my Dad, but I can guarantee you that our last words were "bye. love you. love you too." Yeah... not embarrassed by that in the least.
Ladies of reddit who read erotica, what ruins a good story for you?	Although the moral behind it is nice, condoms in written erotica aren't sexy. "Heavily breathing he gently ran his fingers down my back and said 'okay imma grab a condam now' I was so turned on"	The description of the people's bodies. "I'm a good looking man in my 40's, some would say I'm quite handsome. I'm fit, work out with a 6 pack" Then the girl "She was perfect. Long red hair down to her breasts. Her gratuitous bosoms hung softly yet perky at a large 36 DD. She was petite size I could fit my hands around her waist. Her bottom was so juicy and sat perfectly in her tiny skirt that she wore everywhere, with no underwear. " Like, they have no idea how size works. I get so irritated.
What is the most disgusting thing you've witnessed a woman doing?	having a train ran on her (8 guys in about 2 hours) then went and kissed her boyfriend and slept with him..made me think all females are like that because this girl was "praised" on how innocent and good she "is" when all you hear is "oh shes this that this that" all positive, then you see her do something like that..makes you wonder, "hmm..every girl claims to be this this and that"	Before I was ready to come out of the closet I dated a girl so that I wouldn't turn 19 and still be a virgin. Apparently I was pretty good at going down on her. One time though I made her totally gush just from doing it and apparently she had some massive infection way up in there. To this day I don't eat guacamole because it has the exact same color, taste and consistency as the infected female ejaculate. I dry heaved for days.
Women - if your date/boyfriend is threatened in public to the point where a fight is inevitable, what would you want him to do?	A fight is never inevitable. The best reason to stay in shape is so you can run the fuck away.	I would want my date to try to de-escalate the situation if possible or try to extricate himself from the situation. There's nothing sexy to me about fighting.
Women who went from 0 self-esteem to being very confident; how did you do it?	I had kids. Having to be solely responsible for another human being is empowering, and you realize how little the stuff that used to bring you down actually mattered.	Age. I was a very unconfident, shy and isolated 20 year old. 20+ years later, life is great. I'm happy in all areas of my life (except I can't grow tomatoes)
You have been summoned to dog court on the grounds that you don't love dogs enough. How do you plead?	Guilty because i hate dogs Cool you want a dog? Thats fine i dont want a dog ive exercised my right to not be around a dog. But oh wait people dont control their dogs so they chase me into the street jumping and growling Ive been bit by "nice dogs" 4 times in my life and ive just about had it with them. Im killing the next dog that attacks or jumps at me. If you like dogs i suggest you keep it under control because that next dog might be yours	"Bitches and hounds of the jury, I have been called here on the carpet to answer the question of whether I love dogs or not. Well, I answer that question *with* a question- who's a good dog? *Who's a good dooooog?*" With that defense, I believe I would w-a-l-k.
What do you wish would stop being romanticized?	Fat acceptance disguised as body positivity and self love. There comes a point that you are no longer loving yourself or taking care of yourself if you are on the extreme end of the weight spectrum. On either side. I'm all for being happy with how you look, but we can't ignore health.	Petty fighting. If a man and a woman drive each other up a wall, TV thinks they should be together. In reality it sounds like a load of unnecessary stress.
Guys say they're attracted to a wide range of girls, but online a lot of guys are very harsh about women's bodies. What's the truth?	A lot of guys on the internet are very "soft" on women's bodys and will say almost every woman is hot.	A woman in a picture is *only* a picture. She's got nothing else; she doesn't move, she doesn't smell nice, she doesn't have a nice voice (or any voice), and she's not even 3-D: she's just a flat picture. So she had better look really, really good, because that's all she has. A woman in the same room as you has a whole bunch of assets that a woman in a picture doesn't have, and they can make her attractive in ways that wouldn't work if she was just a picture. When you ask online about some feature, people call up a picture in their heads, and then judge the picture. That's probably the source of the discrepancy you're seeing. Few women get work as underwear models. But most women find men who want to get horizontal.
Fellas with full sleeve tattoos, anything you wish you knew before getting the sleeve?	Glad wrap is your friend after the tattoos. Proper care in the first week is paramount. Purchase a tub of aquaphor. For the first day, just wrap the tattoo with glad wrap. On day 2-4, smother it with aquaphor and continue to wrap it with glad wrap. Do this every 12 hours and wash gently with soap and water between dressing changes. After that, plenty of sun block and moisturizer lotion! I have a partial sleeve on my right arm that is gladiator armor that extends to my chest and back. I get compliments on it all the time when I am wearing a tank top. The more muscular you are the better just FYI. Muscles + cool tattoos = easy conversation with women.	Make sure you see a rough version of the design before the artists puts too much work in to it. They should be more willing to make adjustments and apply feedback if they havent invested a ton of time into it. Do not show up for your first session without having seen the final design. They may be the artist but you own the canvas.
That Joker line from TDK - "They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other."- regardless of what the movie showed, do you think there is some truth to it?	Ehhh sort of. I mean that statement is a reflection of society, but then again it loses credence once you realize that the Joker was a first world anarchist	One thing that sets The Dark Knight apart from any other superhero film is first class screenwriting and dialogue. The only other superhero film that comes close to its dialogue prowess that already isn't part of the trilogy is Logan. The Joker proves disturbing in that film (and outside of it) because he uses statements that hold meaning in that cinematic reality to justify or entertain his chaos. And the people he vilifies and intimidates during his campaign are even more afraid of him because there's a part of them deep down that knows he's not entirely wrong. The chips being down refers to him using Harvey Dent as the trigger to ruin Gotham's sense of security. Within less than a night, the entire police department turns on their old friend. Even after 11 years, it's a film and story that's just as shocking as it is stunning, imho.
What is it about "teaching" that guys enjoy so much?	It is a misplaced drive to display competence. It is completely innate. It is misplaced because teaching is for juveniles, not women. But women activate the protective instincts and the desire to impress, simultaneously. Evolution is powerful but not perfect. Anyways, I married the woman who shut down my mansplaining and explained some things to me. 16 years; 2 kids and counting.	Men are raised to feel that their social value is grounded in expertise from an early age on. So when they can demonstrate expertise (for some that is teaching), many of them get a reward from their subconscious.
I still feel like a boy even though I am a father of 3yo daughter and provide to my family. How do I start feeling like a grown-up man?	Wow. I'm 21 and I still feel like I'm not ready for the world. I have yet to figure it out.	You don't, ever. I have a son and two daughters and I am making everything up as I go. *Everything*. I do not feel grown-up so much as I feel like an 18-year-old with entirely too much responsibility and no way to outsource any of it. You have to get comfortable with improvising, you have to get comfortable with making mistakes (and either owning them or shrugging them off), and you have to get comfortable with projecting the air that you know what you're doing. You will never reach a point where you're like "yeah, I can handle this, that must mean I've finally arrived." There's no scheduled arrival. It's a perpetual journey.
What is the worst first date you have ever been on or seen?	I took a girl out to a nice restaurant and she starts dropping F-bombs. Well, I cringe and politely ask her to watch her language because this wasn’t the time and place to use coarse language. She refrains from using F-bombs for a little while. Then our waiter comes to our table and asks if we’d like dessert. The dipshit waiter then proceeds to have a long enough conversation with the girl and I’m clearly getting irritated by it. He finally realizes that he’s not there to socialize and goes to get the dessert. Once again, she starts dropping F-bombs and when I raise the issue with her, she starts yelling that we’re never going to see these people again and that I shouldn’t even care. I was freaking embarrassed to say the least. Shockingly, that relationship did not last very long.	My friend was asked by a date (very early into said date) ‘Are you on your period? I have this strange talent where I can always smell when a girl is on her period’ She picked up her bag and left immediately.
Does anyone find themselves more often dating a "You'll do" rather than a "Fuck yeah"?	I've never dated a "you'll do" because I wouldn't date them in the first place. I'm not desperate to date anyone.	I have the opposite problem. I find myself frequently pursuing fuck yeahs exclusively and as a result am often dating no one
What is it that's fundamentally wrong with fapping to friends/co-workers?	People are easily offended by things they have no control over. There is nothing wrong with, but it certainly is awkward to talk about. I don't, but my brain doesn't work that way. When I have sexual thoughts, the other players tend to be sort of weirdly generic.	If you are unable to treat someone with kindness and respect merely because you think they're hot and attractive, then you have much bigger problems that your masturbation habits.
Dads - when you play board games, video games, etc with your children, do you let them win or no? Why or why not?	I try to balance games of chance with games of skill. Games of chance, they can win honestly. Obviously, the younger they are, the less skill they have. What kind of asshole would self-congratulate for beating a beginner when they're an expert? That's gross. I teach them the skill, not shame for not having the skill. Teach them the big lesson, that practice is critical to acquiring skill.	I switch off. They will win some, but damnit they will lose some as well. They need to learn how it feels to lose, and how to react to it so they aren't shitheads later on.
What's your most memorable experience with women who are convinced you're attracted to them, when you're really not?	This is a weirdly specific question. I would like to remind OP that agenda-posting is not allowed in this sub.	I lost a friend because she pulled me aside one day to tell me that she's flattered but she really doesn't like me like that. I'm just a good friend. I smiled and told her the truth, the truth being that I feel the same way and am not romantically attracted to her. She got a little salty and sullen and we were never really close again. I figure she was actually into me and was using that conversation to gauge how I felt in her own teen way.
What's it like to be in a fullfilling romantic relationship?	I’ve had a lot of them but none that didn’t fade over time and eventually become an oppressive obligation. The nice parts are in the beginning before money and health and habits get in the way. Having someone to snuggle with and say nice things to you makes your day brighter- until that gets old	The way I describe the feeling is that it feels like home. Especially after a couple years and past the honeymoon phase. It feels comfortable and safe.
What was running into your ex like while you were on a date with another girl?	I've been with my current girlfriend for a year and a half now, and I still get nervous when I run into my ex :) it's been 2 years now. Of course she always asks why I got so stressed all of a sudden, and I always just give some random excuse. We all go to the same college, by the way	Awesome! Me and my date went to a restaurant and my ex works their and she hooked us up with free deserts. Really great date. My date thought it was weird that we were still friends but after I told her how we broke up she was cool with the whole situation. Edit: Just wanted to say me and my ex left on good terms. At the time, I had major depression and I told her we should break up because this relationship wasn't right - I felt that she was more of a nurse than a actual partner and felt she deserved a better relationship.
Men of Reddit, how did you figure out you that you are attractive/unattractive?	When women walk up to you and say "my friend over here likes you" while laughing. It's obvious she's joking with her friend using you as the butt of her jokes. &#x200B; I hope women who do that end up having an ugly child or get cancer, either one is fine.	When I would play truth or dare with my friend group as a kid, none of the girls wanted to do any dares involving me, but they had no issues doing them with my friends.
What was the most romantic moment you've experienced?	I met a girl outside a nightclub who immediately started making out with me, telling me I was "so fucking fit", grabbing me by the groin and shoving my hand down her shirt. Then offering me a bj in the loos.	My ex and I were sitting on the roof of her house. She was sitting on my lap and we were both staring at the stars. We had been silently staring for a while and for the first time I randomly just said "I love you" really softly. She was ecstatic because she felt the same way but was too nervous to say it. We made out on her roof for like 30 minutes. Probably going to take a while to top that one.
How do you find friends in a new town where you know no one? How long did it take for you to feel comfortable with your new friend base?	Join a church with lots of groups/activities, make friends through work, find a bar near you where you can be a "regular" (think Cheers). Bars typically lend themselves to easy conversations with new people. Also, taking classes is a great way to meet people.	i highly reccomend joining a a group thats either like a yoga class weekly, or a sports team like derby or something similar. Anything that meets frequently so you can do a new activity and meet other people who are into it too! Its something to bond over, rather than going out for drinks and trying to make small talk that way.
What's the most seemingly unrelated thing over which you have ever lost your attraction to someone?	Seriously these are really crummy things to lose attraction for. All of these things could be talked about and resolved so that your relationship could move on. Its really stupid to take these things seriously when the possibility of love is real. Feel free to downvote me.	He laughed like a hyena during movies in a theatre and would repeat the funny lines in the loudest voice ever. Example: Actor in movie: "you smell like dirty laundry, wash yo' self" Ex SO: "HAHAHAHAAH, YOU SMELL LIKE DIRTY LAUNDRY, WASH YO' SELF!!!!!!!" So embarrassing.
Are you Team White/Gold or Team Blue/Black?	Wait, some people see this as blue and black? That... freaks me out. Where's the black part? I really only see gold and white.	I don't understand how someone could see this the other way... How does this work? edit: I suspect this is just trolling, and certain users are in on the joke, and no one has spilled the beans yet. >___> edit #2: OH MY GOD, holy fuck! I just glanced away for awhile, saw the post of the blue dress someone else posted, and then glanced back at the OP, **and the dress was blue and black this time**. Though it quickly faded back to being white and gold. Try looking at a clearer picture of the dress, with OP's picture in your periphery. I can force myself to see the dress as blue if I do this.
Guys who waited until mariage to start having sex because of their girlfriend, how long did you wait and was it worth it?	Something I'd add is if you're jerking off a ton and watching porn, are you really waiting? At that point you'd be doing more harm than good in my opinion. Harm to your brain chemistry. A mans desire for a woman should be almost unbearable. Don't jerk off for a while and see what I mean.	As long as you're with someone who's going to be emotionally available, positive, and empathetic, you'll discover pretty quickly that losing your virginity is just not a big deal. It's silly to have sex just to be able to say you did, but if you're with someone you really care about and trust, it's silly to wait if you want to do it. Use a fuckin condom.
What is your ideal date with your SO?	I can't help you, all my ideal dates (and fortunately my SO's too) involve going outdoors and hiking or climbing.	Always remember to fuck first. You will be way too full and satiated and sleepy after 7 courses and wine. My ideal date would be hiking in the mountains somewhere, followed by a jacuzzi, sex, and a nap, then a tasting menu with wine pairings at a super intimate venue with live music
Has anyone actually had TSS from tampon use?	I did and almost died. I used kotex, only had it in five hours. Spent two weeks in intensive care. I only use pads now and urge you to do the same.	I've never known anyone who had TSS, though I do have a weird recurring paranoia of it myself, despite the fact that I regularly sleep with tampons in and apparently once was paying so little attention that I accidentally put two tampons in at once and only noticed when I pulled on one string and two of them came out. God knows how long that first one had been up there. Anyway, you're probably fine. Just change it regularly.
How common is it for young men to get sexually assaulted/groped by older women?	"Every" man has dealt with this at some point in his life just like "every" woman has. The difference is we don't make a big fucking deal about it.	Probably more common than you'd think. Many older women (in my experience) will do things that would be considered sexual harassment if the genders were reversed once they get drunk, but it's just considered something you have to deal with. I've been lucky enough to only have had to deal with older drunk women who were *very aggressively flirting*, they never quite started touching me, probably because of the big fluorescent STAFF vest though
If you could talk to one person who is no longer in your life, who would you pick? What would you tell/ask them?	To my ex: My phone is auto-correcting what I want to say to you, so I'll stop fighting it. Duck you.	My late aunt. She passed a few years ago suddenly due to cancer. She was healthy and then within months was gone. I'd just thank her for showing me how to make baked ziti as a teen. I make it a few times a year and it's always a hit. But more importantly, it always reminds me of her, and I'm glad I'm able to share it with my family.
Those of you who roomed with your best friends, how did it go?	He got mopey and depressed, I lost pretty much all respect for him, we barely talk anymore. Can't reccomend against it highly enough	Badly. I was a freshman in college, he was a junior (sophomore?) -- so both young and stupid. Too much time together, couldn't find a balance, blah blah blah. That being said -- by my senior year I moved in with a guy I hardly knew and he and I became best friends and still are now, 18 years later. Damn. If one of us had a uterus and we'd made a baby it could vote by now...
How did you handle realizing you may not like your parents for who they are?	Don't judge other people like that. Like what you like about them, and dislike what you dislike about them. That's how you should deal with most of the people in your life. If what they're doing is affecting you negatively, take reasonable and respectful steps to assert yourself. Otherwise, accept it and instead go focus on improving yourself; you can't improve other people.	I told myself that loving someone doesn't necessarily mean I have to like them. I live far away and talk maybe once every 2 weeks. It's all superficial stuff nothing too deep. I have no interest in being friends with them .
Men of reddit, what is something you never thought would happen to you...until it did?	I'm going to say being broken into also. Fortunately and unfortunately, everybody was home sleeping. My 9 year old sister had nightmares for a few months afterwards.	I never thought I'd get depression or have suicidal thoughts. On a more positive side: receiving free review copies of games from Nintendo before release.
Why is lol an acceptable form of punctuation?	People say it means nothing but it does tend to be used more by idiots and I judge them accordingly.	"I've told you like 5 times. next time don't be so stubborn lol" "I've told you like 5 times. Next time don't be so stubborn." Without the lol at the end you'd think I was mad or upset.
How many of you dudes at the gym are really as mean as you look?	Im the guy at the gym smiling, grinning enjoyin myself. I work my ass off n am focused but between sets im lovin life. Course i smoke bud b4 every gym sesh.	I was a competitive powerlifter, unless I was with my squad or even now days I'm always with headphones while working out. I'd always spot anyone, if they'll ask for tips I'll give em tips and I never try to be bad to anyone.
I'm 25, I'm an adult and I'm getting bullied from an adult. He is a peer and a friend of friends. What do I do?	Bench/size means absolutely nothing. My advice: next time he starts his shit, be brutal. Strike hard, fast, and often. A kick to the knee/nuts, followed up by a headbutt or eye gouge, then either punch, elbow, or knee him till he goes down. From there, stomp or kick him till you're tired or he's unconscious. Don't go to the ground with him, unless you have decent bjj or wrestling skills	Look, you're both grown men, this isn't high school anymore. If he's fucking with you at work, make a complaint to his boss, or HR. If it continues, contact a lawyer. If he's fucking with you outside of the office, tell him off and if he retaliates with violence, press charges and sue him. Bullies work by convincing their victims that they have no options. The reality is you do. He's an adult and that means he has to accept adult repercussions for his actions, like getting fired, or sued, or put in jail.
how would you feel about your SO packing/making a lunch for you everyday when you go to work ?	I love that idea. It feels very traditional if you will. Sexist? I don't know but my opinion is my opinion.	I'm still a student so I've yet to hit that point but my parents do this for each other every night. Their lunches the next day are usually a reconstruction of dinner leftovers, so they do this thing where they each propose the easiest yet tastiest way to reimagine the food and whoever's idea is best doesn't have to do it haha. So the person with the bad idea ends up making the good idea, if that makes sense. They'll end up switching off if one of them routinely has the better ideas, just to keep it fair. I think it's cute.
What’s a great way to surprise your SO?	Edit: I'm changing my answer cuz I didn't finish reading the question. I like to send him pictures of cute dogs I find on the internet	My boyfriend is in a bowling league. Every once in a while I'll call while he's there playing and ask the bartender to bring a round of drinks to him and his team and put it on my card.
What is the most ridiculous misconception you have ever heard about men?	Go to /r/askwomen, /r/TrollXChromosomes, /r/feminism and /r/womensrights. There are so many ridiculous, stupid, ignorant and sexist comments about men in those subreddits.	All these are so serious... jeez. The most ridiculous one I've heard was from a girl who thought that when men weren't erect, they just "rolled their penises up into a ball" that they kept in their underpants and that's what a "bulge" is.
If there was a national men's march, what issues would be at the center of attention?	We've had our fill of shitty comments in this thread so we're locking it. If you have any questions, please message the mods, not me specifically, unless you want to tell me how cool I am. Thanks.	We've had our fill of shitty comments in this thread so we're locking it. If you have any questions, please message the mods, not me specifically, unless you want to tell me how cool I am. Thanks.
How can I talk to my boyfriend about lasting longer? NSFW?	Don't blame my dude. Sometimes the pussy be so wet that a nigga can't help but skeet. One time I met this pregnant latina at Walmart. Bruh I swear I nutted after 47 seconds.	There is only one sure way I've found to deal with it. Be a two pump chump for round 1, then a bucking stallion for round 2
What's your best "OH SHIT" moment story when you realized you were instantly in a situation?	Sitting in the back of a sheriffs car in the county garage/internal separator from inside to outside. Then washing naked in front of an old man lol baby mommas momma dropped the charges but state picked them up for contributing and probation violation. The judge had an unofficial one on one with me that I failed to visit therefore he issued a warrant lmao fuckin small towns man gotta love them	Spending $400 on music festival tickets then driving 4 hours to realize you and your friend have left the tickets back in your home town
What is some adivce you commonly see given on AW that you find not helpful or annoying?	People always suggest that you report someone to the authorities, even when there is no authority to report them to, you're not in grade school anymore. It's like tattling will solve all your problems.	Whenever someone tries to explain motivations of people they don't know in someone else's stories. It's one thing when someone's explicitly asking if anyone has any input on it, but it's quite another to have the inner thoughts of your high school best friend explained to you by some random on the internet.
To what extent is pick up artistry bull crap?	Well its real human psychology they use, they just over sell it on how easy and fool proof it is.	It acts as though women are a computer that you must hack through these amazing tricks, and once you got it down there is little to no failure. The objectification when it comes to tactics is kind of a "one size fits all" mindset. Most of the girls I pick up is just from swallowing my pride, sacking up and just starting a conversation. I'm a fan of reading body language, but the mental gymnastics to employ pickup tactics are generally unnecessary.
How long are you open to waiting for sex when dating someone new?	Until we're married. There's actually no reason for sexual intimacy in a relationship you don't even know is going to work out.	I’d prefer it sooner but I’d be willing to wait if I thought the person had long term relationship potential.
What useful YouTube channels are you subbed to and why?	Athlean-X, no bullshit fitness and health info. Like to see some new muscle group workouts to change up the routine every so often.	"Useful" You know what, I have so many damn subs that I watch, I'm just gonna list 'em out with short descriptions. Applied Science- Engineering AvE- working man's engineering Bob Ross- Bob Ross Bosnian Bill- Lockpicking stuff Chop with Chris- Hand tools only woodworking Clickspring- Clockmaking Cody's Lab- chemistry and random stuff Colin Furze- Insane inventions ElectroBOOM- "stupid" engineering Engineer Guy- How things work Every Frame a Painting- Cinematography Frank Howarth- Woodworking Gordon Ramsay- Gordon Ramsay GREENPOWERSCIENCE- Solar power stuff Matthias Wandel- Woodworking Numberphile- neat numbers NurdRage- Chemistry focused Oskar Puzzle- 3d printed puzzles Paul Sellers- Woodworking Primitive Technology- neat old world buildings RegularCars- Regular Car reviews Steve Ramsey- Woodworking Styropro- Lasers and moths The Post Apocalyptic Inventor- similar to AvE Tips From a Shipwright- self explanatory Tom Scott- "things you may not have known" Veritasium- Similar to Tom Scott And that's it I guess.
What age do you stop being naked around your kids?	Honestly I just think it’s inappropriate. Is the benefit that much that it overrides your child’s limited understanding of nudity. Just chuck on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. I wouldn’t walk around with my knob out while I hold my 8month old baby. Just all kinds of wrong to do it regularly and I’m no prude.	I’m 28 and my mum still refuses to wear appropriate clothing. I’d say the point when your kid starts getting embarrassed is a good stopping point if you haven’t already
How can women be better advocates and more supportive of men's mental health?	They won't ever be able to. Women do not and cannot understand weakness in men. It is a massive turnoff. It's just the way they're wired. Men are not supposed to cry about things just suffer in silence. If you think I'm wrong just listen to all the stories of men who "opened up" to their significant other. It doesn't end well. Bare in mind I am not shitting on women here nor saying men don't deal with these issues. But men should never open up to women about these things, or anyone for that matter. Seek therapy, deal with your issues, and move forward.	If a man opens up to you, try and be completely non-judgmental. It's hard for men to be vulnerable, and often even harder to do it in front of women- we're meant to be the supportive, strong ones and all that gender role stuff. People are stigmatising themselves in their head even as they open up. Sometimes women shy away from men who are vulnerable which perpetuates this. Be mindful of that, and be kind and listen. They've had to make this leap and try and trust you, so repay that as much as you can. You're only one person, you're not a therapist- always remember your boundaries when you're supporting anyone. But being kind and accepting can really help. It means a lot.
Women of r/AskMen: What is you HATE about this forum?	Alright this discussion has run it's course. Lots of threads descending in slap fights. I hope everyone had a good time circle jerking it and now are all sticky and sweaty from the past day's activities.	Alright this discussion has run it's course. Lots of threads descending in slap fights. I hope everyone had a good time circle jerking it and now are all sticky and sweaty from the past day's activities.
Men of Reddit, how do you balance how you want to look like vs what "society" wants you to look like?	I never understand why people care so much about what others think about their fashion sense. I show up to school in basketball shorts and some wrinkled shirt. I dont care, im there to have classes not to impress someone.	Where do you live that jeans and t-shirts are not OK for adults? It's standard adultwear near me, certainly in casual situations. You wouldn't wear them for a formal job but they are fine for casual work like mine. As long as they are clean, have no holes and fit well, there is no issue with them.
What is your take on the modern obsession with traveling?	I think traveling is kinda silly. No matter where you go you're a tourist. You can go places, you can see them, but you're not part of the native culture. You can't understand a place by visiting for 5 minutes, or even for a full year. You're looked at as an outsider who's just passing through. I can't believe there are people arrogant enough to think just because they visited a place, they think they fully understand it or can speak about the local culture or milieu.	Where the hell do you get the money to travel? Do you guys take out loans or something? -from a guy who wants to travel but can't due to no funds
[NSFW] What does it feel like to have your balls sucked?	I guess it'd be similar to having your clit played with? It's similar to the feeling of having the penis proper sucked but they're more sensitive to both pleasure and pain. That's why you've got to be careful with them, and why we don't want them sucked the whole time, just like 25\-50&#37; of the time.	The balls are like a priceless Ming Dynasty vase in display case. They are mostly to be looked at. You can handle them but only carefully. They are fragile. They are of great value to the owner. Reckless activity in the vicinity of them is strictly prohibited.
What community do you think comes with a lot of 'gatekeeping'?	This one. Edit* To anyone reading this, I have since been banned and muted. Read what I have written and you decide if it was appropriate.	Gaming (both video and board/tabletop/card). The only stores I've gone into and felt uncomfortable in, like I was intruding. I went for the midnight launch of Fallout 4 and was standing in line playing games on my phone to kill time and the dudes in line behind me were being complete assholes about that, like I'm a fake gamer for playing mobile games, like OKAY GUYS I'LL JUST HAUL MY CONSOLE, TV AND A GENERATOR TO THIS PARKING LOT AT MIDNIGHT TO WAIT IN LINE, seriously.
Do you ever feel like you'll be single for a while/forever? How do you cope with that?	My value isn't contingent on the presence or absence of another person. That said, I'm married, but I was happily single for many years before. If, heaven forbid, something happened to him, I'd be content to be single forever after.	I've been single for years by choice. It could be forever, who knows. I don't cope because I'm at a point where I truly being on my own. If someone came along who fit my life I wouldn't necessarily reject it but I'm content alone.
What quality can one girl have that automatically makes her better than other girls?	Tattoos. On women I just do not like them, it makes women look trashy. I know tattoos are popular these days so I just use them as a filtering device.	Curiosity and some sort of quality that has her up front and forward. A girl that doesn't ask any questions is boring as all hell. It doesn't have to be about me specifically, but about the world and everything regarding anything. Someone that values knowledge and wants to learn. Wanting to learn is also a sign of intelligence. A drive to become better and understand. There is something oddly sexy about learning. Especially science.
Ladies, do you feel that men sometimes don't take us seriously about what we go through with creepy guys?	Thanks for a great discussion over the past 12 hours, folks!

Do any of you orgasm too easily?	It's not quite that easy for me, but I'm still definitely a lightweight. And since I'm trans, it's pretty much one and done. I worry a lot about it, but so far it hasn't been a problem with any of my partners. I just do my best to make sure they're satisfied first.	I could orgasm from things like that, but I'd have to be putting in at least a bit of mental effort. I can basically think myself off. That said, getting off when I don't want to would be super irritating.
How can a man have a best friend that is a girl and also have a girlfriend?	Haha oh he can’t. Anyone saying otherwise is full of shit. Show me all the happily married men with female best friends, oh that’s right, they don’t exist. Same goes for women having guy best friends. Not going to work. PC society wants to say it can, find me an example first then we’ll talk.	Yes. Men are allowed to cultivate friendships with other women and no, that doesn't mean they are attracted to them. My SO and I have best friends of the opposite sex, neither of us is afraid that we're going to cheat with those friends. It's about having trust in your SO and the relationship you're building.
How old is too old for a child to sit on your lap; or when does the physical contact situation change between an adult and child?	I dont know if me being a female changes this, but i have a 12yo cousing and i wouldnt have a problem with her sitting on my lap, specially in a situation like the one you mentioned. No wrong doing whatsoever.	My 12 and 13 year old daughters sit on my lap all the time. I see no problem with this.
How do I tell my boyfriend that I'm losing attraction to him because of his beer belly?	It's up to you. Don't forget that your metabolism isn't always going to be what it is today. If you love him, stay. If it's a deal breaker, leave. My wife is 40 lbs more than she was when we met. I hang around 180, always have. She is as beatiful today as she was the day we met. Love the person, not the body. The body will change. We all age.	There's no easy way to do it, but at least take some comfort that the genders aren't reversed. There's a little less social stigma that way. You need to convey your feelings on the matter, so I suggest you be direct about it so that he gets that it isn't an idle wish but an actual impediment to a healthy relationship. Say what you say here, that it's difficult for you to imagine continuing a relationship with someone who doesn't prioritize their health and to whom you are losing attraction. Be direct, but not cruel. His reaction will tell you a lot about the future of things. I doubt he's unaware of the development, but sometimes a healthy intervention can start a turnaround. And sometimes it takes the risk of losing a good thing to get off your ass and stop being lazy.
What initially attracted you to your partner?	Lean, athletic body, soothing voice, laid back demeanor, great dancer. I had only planned to ride him for a Summer, but decided to keep on dancing and riding.	The conversation. The first time we properly met, we just talked for about 6 hours straight. It flowed easily and we enjoyed each other's company.
What's the most bizarre question/generalization about women you've seen in this sub?	There actually was a girl that stated here that she did in fact do that. It is as disgusting as the girl who stated that she would reach a finger into her vagina to massage a very stubborn poo out of her poohole. I have never done either of those things. That is grotesque.	There was that one guy who thought women in his class were wearing the same color shirt as him to attract him. His thought process was basically "I was wearing a red shirt and then the next class this woman was wearing a red shirt, she totally wants the d, right?"
Pro-life ladies (or "reluctant pro-choice" ladies), what feelings and thoughts do you have when a woman miscarries?	I have had a miscarriage and I am 100% pro life as a result. From a biological point of view, a human being's life begins at conception because a new, unique human organism is created. When I was pregnant I was aware of this reality but when I lost my child and seen his face I understood it on a much more deep level. We need to extend human rights to ALL human beings. A pre born child or a human fetus is a human being and deserves the same rights as everyone else. That is my opinion!	I'm not sure if I should respond because I'm not sure if I qualify as "reluctant pro-choice".. To clarify, I consider myself pro-choice - I think that abortion should be legal, every woman should have that option. However, I do not *think* that I could have an abortion (I'm not 100% certain that I would never have one though). Does that qualify me as "reluctant pro-choice"? I would feel sorry for the parents when there is a miscarriage. Similar to you, I wouldn't think about the fetus at all - unless someone else brought it up. However, if the woman was far along when the miscarriage happened or it was a still birth, then I would feel sorry for the parents and the baby.
What is something you don't realistically expect your partner to do, but would greatly appreciate if he did that for you?	It's shallow, but I really like presents. Even something small. I think it's so sweet when you mention something once and a person remembers and gets it for you. I keep a list in my phone to do this for other people, just because I like being the king of presents.	I'm not in a relationship, but when I am I love and always secretly wish to be surprised by flowers.
What is the most challenging issue women face when they have long hair?	I feel kinda privileged here. It's down to the small of my back now, almost there to my goal of the bottom of my bum. I can just put my hair above my pillow and it stays all night. It's straight and I need only brush it for a minute in the morning and at night before bed, or before I go out. The only "challenge" I have is its heavy, and I need to use multiple hair ties to keep it up in a high pony, so usually I use a low boring pony. Otherwise, for me and my hair type just letting it be long is the easy way out, it mostly takes care of itself.	In high school it was those chairs with the two buttons on top. My hair would swirl around in them and get ripped out when I would stand up. Brutal.
Is it a chore for you to have sex with your wife? If so why is it?	Because it's difficult navigating my house with an errection without knocking over all my waist high assortments B) Honestly not big. Just like jokes.	It can be a chore because my wife is...delicate. Anything longer than 10-15 minutes (actual penetration) causes her pain, so I have to be quick.
FAQ: How do you flirt with a girl you want to hook up with vs. a girl you want to date? Is there a difference?	I tend to be more of myself when I'm flirting with a girl I want a relationship with, just because the possibility of her seeing through the confidence I've faked during the actual flirting during the relationship sounds scary. If sex is all I want, and if the thing is mutual, I'll let my fantasy go wild. Especially if I'll never see that girl again, I'll start coming up with cool shit about myself that aren't real just for fun.	In my opinion, I've noticed that I behave differently but this doesn't apply to all men. With a girl I want to hook up with I don't go out of my way to see her. I answer less often, I joke around about sex a lot. A girl I'm trying to date I'll be playful but respect boundaries until we cross them, I answer when I can, and I go out of my way to see them. Disclaimer This is probably why I am single
How do you finally say fuck it &amp; change your life for the better?	i just say "fuck it". I dont care about changing my life. End of the day people will let you down and bitches will front on you.	You start listening to people that like you for being who you want to be. Not people that like you for who they want you to be.
What made you think your SO was not the one for you?	She didn't suck my dick or let me put it in the ass. Who can stay with somebody like that for a lifetime? Fuck that shit	I guess the day I discovered she had cheated on me with one of my best friends was a pretty good eye opener
How did your parents/family fuck up your relationship with food?	I never got to eat spicy food, so it took me well into adulthood to handle it. Of course, when I discover I love it, I'm also old enough to get nasty acid reflux. THANKS MOM AND DAD.	starting from 2nd grade, my mom weighed me every single morning before school, and most of the time after school as well. if my weight wasn't to her expectation, my lunch would change. she kept it written down on a chart visible to everyone in the family. there's a lot more, but that's probably the biggest one. i learned from the age of 6 to be very ashamed of my fat, ugly body. it was on me, the 6 year old, to somehow know proper nutrition, despite the fact that my morbidly obese mother did not teach me anything.
Non-North Americans /r/askwomen what NA specific questions are you sick of seeing/answering on reddit or elsewhere online?	I know it's a shitstorm and people are naturally worried, but anything Trump related. He might be a piece of shit, but that's the thing with democracy! Even pieces of shit can be Presidents. Here in South America we've had loads of shitty presidents, and we're still alive! Life goes on, even under terrible governments.	The ones where Europe is assumed to be one homogenous place. "*What are European men like?*" Uhm... diverse? --- "*It's because of big pharma!!!*" Except it is like that all over the world, where things are run differently than in the US.
What are some ideas you cannot believe young, modern women still express?	All the stupid deep bullshit they always post on fb, im not against the bs itself but the fact that they keep saying all that cool shit on fb (stolen from somewhere ofc) and never ever do it themself. Men do it too but to a lesser. Oh yeh and the fact that they keep sending posts saying how much they love her friends or whatever, that's okay too but dont do it every fucking week... and well we all know next summer u wont be friends anymore, it's all for the likes.	The idea that anal/oral sex isn't "real sex" blows my mind. Blows the shit right out of it. Also, (and this I've only seen in teenagers, but it's shockingly prevalent in those I know) the idea that all women should weigh ____ pounds. In other words, the idea that regardless of height or bone structure or whatever, that all women should weigh the same "thin" amount. (I just had a come-to-Jesus discussion with my husband's stepsister that not every woman should weigh 115 to be healthy. Girl does not have a healthy handle on weight.)
Why do we find certain clothing/outfits more sexy than the naked body itself?	Nudity isn't inherently sexual. Imagine if it was. There'd be a lot more people with gore fetishes at the very least. It's the sexual potential that's attractive, so naturally, clothing that communicates higher promiscuity or levels of arousal will be sexier. This is especially true if you associate an aesthetic with a personality you find arousing.	I think a big part of it is the mystery, but also I think it excites us because it's they're sexualised items and when a woman wears them, a lot of the time it'll be because she has sex on her mind and wants you to have sex on yours (or more specifically, on the mind of the guys she'd actually have sex with - there's often collateral damage when in public.) So it's both "ooh I wonder what's underneath!" and "oooh this woman is thinking about sex and maybe I have a chance!" Both are exciting. Of course that isn't always the case, but that's how I instinctively respond to seeing it regardless of how I choose act on that response.
What advice do you give to younger men about life/relationships?	Don't get into a serious relationship too early. Save that for your late 20's (at least) and live your life first.	So, you're head over heels for some girl, but she won't give you the time of day? Move on. She's not worth your time, and there will always be someone else.
Let's say you give your parents permission to choose a spouse for you. Who do you think THEY would choose to marry you to? Why?	Male here- There's this really hot family friend who I click with really well and we're very close. She goes to a prestigious university and she's athletic and pre-med and everybody who knows the both of us says we should be together. Our parents even tried setting us up several times but despite my willingness, she seems to be rather uninterested, so I also have to feign disinterest. Edit: I guess it wouldn't be too bad... I should look into arranged marriage laws. That's not legal in the US right	My mom is still sour that I didn't marry my university boyfriend. He's a lawyer now. He's still a great guy and I see him every couple of years when I'm in his city but I'm over the moon happy with my fiancé.
What's your most unusual hobby, and how did you get into it?	Cosplay is my weird hobby-making costumes of characters and wearing them to conventions. Whats weirder I guess is that I usually cosplay male characters haha. It's a fun hobby and a great creative outlet. It's also taught me lots of skills like sewing and how to use power tools.	I'm a professional seamstress now so I guess all my related hobbies like embroidery are no longer really hobbies. I am quite good at finding moderately valuable art at thrift stores. My most valuable piece is a signed and numbered Erte print that I payed $15 for and is appraised at $1500. I have another that I payed $25 for that is worth $300 and a few I haven't had appraised. However, I spend so much on the framing and I never intend to sell them so their value is moot 😆
(Inspired by AskMen) Non-American women who frequent here, what are some differences you notice here compared to women of your home country?	Eh, mostly online general but the america-centric BS is annoying. It does happen here, especially with women thinking an issue American women face = world wide womens issue. It gets really annoying because America does have a lot of issues like when it comes to transgender rights, non-whites, gay rights and even womens rights and they love spouting on about it like its an issue around the entire world. They look at American life and American problems and apply it to everyone else. I'm not saying America is awful and every other country is perfect, it's not, we all have our own problems, but America =/=world. American centrism gets REALLY fucking annoying.	**Dating:** A big one for dating culture is that cold approaches seem to be really rare here outside of pubs/bars/nightclubs. People talk about being hit on in the supermarket and I'm like WTF who does that??! **Periods:** Applicator tampons are not that common here. We do have them and I know girls who use them but they're definitely not standard. Pretty much all public bathrooms (and private businesses) in NZ have special bins for tampons/pads. Not some weird ass little brown paper bag but like a proper tall closed lid bin with this special fluid inside. In the better places the bin lid is motion activated.
What advice would you give to women who struggle accepting their SO watch porn?	Find someone who does not watch porn. Also find a dictionary and learn the difference between lust and love, as well as real and fake.	I have lots of anxiety about being denied sex, and masturbating to porn helps get me through the days I can't have sex with her.
About three hours ago I caught my girlfriend stealing money from me. What do I do?	Is there any chance she was just borrowing the money and was going to tell you when you got out of the shower?	> The bank says the cannot do anything right now because technically it's her money too (since we share the account). It is not "technically" her money. It's a shared account. It IS her money. You need to get a lawyer because you're in for a nasty fight.
Anyone else hate how they look right after a haircut?	I always feel better after a hair cut. I have my hair short and when it grows it feels like shit.	No I am always amazed at just how much better it makes me look! I have very thick hair so it's needs taming I guess.
What is the bare minimum of self-care that a person should do for themselves during a rough patch?	I'm not a woman, but as a very feminine man I like to think that I have a woman's intuition ;) I think the bare minimum would be showering at least 3 times a week, brushing teeth at least daily (you WILL regret getting a cavity), and some form of mental stimulation. In certain cases it's unrealistic to expect somebody having a hard time to keep up with the discipline of healthy eating and exercise, but if you can you should. Whatever your problem is- Don't worry, it'll get better. Probably.	Showers and brushing your teeth in the morning and at the end of the day. Those damn dentist bills can really add up. :\
How comfortable are you with platonic same-sex physical affection? How often do you touch and embrace friends?	Never, I keep that connection for my girlfriend. I don't think it will ever be seen as normal for two males to do things that you said, unless they're partners or flirting. I don't think males need to bond that way, that's what fist bumps and foul mouthed insults are for, that's how males treat their friends	In my experience guys don't really do this, some times we'll briefly hug or clasp hands if we're greeting each other but by and large we're much less touchy feely than women I think. All my female friends are super okay with hugging for seemingly no reason and it's pretty disconcerting. Maybe I'm just fucking gay
What is the most ‘wtf’ thing you’ve done out of horniness?	If I gotta shoot one off I do. I take my time away to clear my mind. Of course I'd rather be balls deep in some wet pussy but this'll have to do.	I just remembered the girl at my high school who got caught with a test tube up her vagina in the science labs during lunch time. I hope she’s doing well.
What about your appearance is "fake"?	Nothing whatsoever. To use one of your examples - I happen to be wearing combat boots every day at the moment. However, that has nothing to do with the extra height - I'm 6'2" and don't need it - instead having everything to do with it being cold and wet. I like having dry feet. I put stuff in my hair to make it manageable? Does that count? My hair isn't naturally this stand-uppy.	I have absolutely no chin. Like at all. Just mouth to neck basically. Full on Bob's Burgers style. To combat this problem I grew a beard as soon as I could and shave it to appear as though there is a chin under it. Works surprisingly well.
Why aren't there any "plus sized" male models?	Hypocritical isn't it? Most women would NEVER go for a fat man. But men are 'shallow, stupid, and childish' among other things if they don't find obese, fat, and 'plus-sized' women attractive. (That's sarcasm for those of you who can't tell.) There a huge difference between mildly overweight to fat/obese/morbidly obese. Depending on a woman's height to weight then I wouldn't go for a woman who's more then mildly overweight. A value my own health enough to stay in a good weight range. If she doesn't then that's not attractive. What I find attractive, just like any other person, is my business. Many women aren't asking for the Men's Health model with abs and perfect hair. They are not out looking for some fat slob who hasn't seen his dick since puberty.	Because there's no male fat acceptance movement. I don't think I've ever heard a man say that he wants to see plus sized male models.
What is the cringiest way you've ever shown interest in someone you wanted to date, that still makes you want to crawl away and die of shame?	Asked for their facebook immediately after the date. Apparently that is creepy because that is too personal. I'm a man and for all she knows I might come to her house and kill her. Women have to deal with creepy dudes all the time so I understand why they might be scared.	Well, here it goes -- I once waited right beside the stir-fry section of our dining hall trying to work up the courage to ask out a guy who worked in the dining hall. I was there for like two hours and I *finally* worked up the courage to ask him out on a date. It turns out that he had absolutely no idea who I was and we had a class together the previous semester that was capped at 15 students. Oh god.
What's your favourite Simpsons episode?	You all can shut the hell up cause it's the Michael Jackson episode. You remember what a huge feat that was at the time?	The episode about Lisa's first word. Great episode, great ending, when Homer says to Maggie "The sooner kids talk the sooner they talk back. I hope you never say a word." And Maggie takes out her pacifier and says her first and only word "Daddy". Gets me every single time. I love The Simpsons.
What piece of 'obvious' advice has saved your life?	"don't have sex with someone who you don't want to father your children and spend the rest of your life with, because if something goes wrong, your going to spend the rest of your life with him because hes your childs father"	Not quite so intense (and I'm glad you're okay!), but a college professor told me before leaving, "So many students overwhelm themselves trying to decide what they're going to do with the rest of their lives. You can change your mind." Obvious. Not always simple, but there is some room to use your education and life experiences to explore different options. Knowing that keeps me sane.
What are some of the absent-minded things you do?	Pick at the skin along my finger nails, make that ridiculous "duck lips" face to make sure my septum jewelry is straight, run my hands over my head, check my phone.	Forget what I'm doing in the middle of a task and spend several moments just stranding there staring into space. It's like I'm a sim and someone just cancelled my action.
Is Bromance with Benefits a thing?	Why do you have to associate closeness with 'how dicks looked'? I am closer than close than close with 2 good/great friends, and everything's up for grabs, except real sexual things. As in, real life sex-acts and anatomy between us. Rest everything about sex-acts and anatomy is okay, but ours and our families' sex-lives we generally don't talk about. And, we've not and don't want to see each other naked/etc. either: no. I hope noone of us shows each others our dicks; let's just say that.	"benefits" in this context refers to sexual acts, and if both of the guys are straight then that's not gonna happen
How much does it take you to get hungover, and how has it changed over time?	I am almost 50. If I drink even a couple of drinks from a beer, I will have a hangover. If I manage to get an entire drink or entire beer down, I will be hungover for days. I have always gotten hangovers, but they have gotten steadily worse as I have gotten older. I has really discouraged me from drinking. On a bright note, since I do not drink, I just had a scan of my liver, and it is really healthy.	How much booze it takes for me to have a hangover is one of the great mysteries of the universe. Sometimes it's three or four drinks, sometimes I've had seven or eight and been fine. My hangovers have definitely gotten worse as I've gotten older though. Edit: Yes, even when I drink all the water.
Men who have wives or girlfriends, how much failure in the dating game did you go through before you met the right woman for you?	I'm not going to call it 'failure', because it wasn't. I've had a ton of success with women in my life. I compare it to 'sifting through garbage' until you found that hidden gem. To qualify this: I am in my early thirties, have had sex with approximately 220 - 250 different women, hooked up with (everything except sex) with about the same and probably just gone out with around ~1000 since I was in my late teens. I can count on one hand the amount of girls I legitimately enjoyed spending my time with and wanted a relationship with.	Honestly, not much. I'm 14 years past the game, but I was a bad player. I was such a bad player I rarely played. This cost me a whole lot of experience, but not quality outcomes. I had only a few bad, or unsuccessful experiences, and still had the relationships that mattered. The relationships that mattered fell in my lap. When I chased it, it always sucked. And there was a lot of forearm exercise in between.
Has anyone ever dated or become friends with a *former* celebrity (child star for ex. or just someone who had been out of the spotlight for awhile)?	a friend's sister was on the MTV show "jersey shore." none of the cast members were portrayed in a great light, but she is actually a very nice, down to earth and quiet person.	I had a piano lesson with harry connick Jr once. He taught me this awesome lick. I also told him to go play portal and he didn't have any meaningful acting or music roles afterwards for a while.
Parents of Reddit, in what ways has your child(ren) reminded you of yourself when you were their age?	My son is clever but not smart. He lies when it's easy for him to do so and gets him out of work. He listens only when he wants to. He's pulling a ME and he just started school. He's going to be devious, lazy, and quick witted and probably get on the nerves of more than few teachers.	My mum says that her mum used to say "you have an answer to everything" and my mother never knew what she meant by it until I started coming out with answers to everything
My coworkers call me a hippie just because I'm from Austin, Tx and I eat organic. What irritating thing happens to you at work?	Well, it depends on which side of the divide you're on. If you're pre-80s Austin, you're a real Texan. If you're post, there's a good chance you're a hippie. If you're a transplant, go back to California.	My boss is really weird and questions everything, like she thinks we're constantly lying to her and making stuff up. If she's never heard of it before, her first response is to think it isn't real. Example: Yesterday we were eating pizza in the office and some of my co-workers started talking about Showbiz Pizza and the animatronic band of animals from when we were kids. My boss suddenly got this weird look on her face and asked us what an animatronic was, then when we explained it, she had to go look it up because she didn't believe any of us. ...Why would we make some shit up like that? It irritates me.
Are you bitter at your childhood teachers about something?	MOD NOTE: I know you hate your teachers. Y'all are making that abundantly clear. Your comments will, however, get removed if they contain [gendered slurs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/wiki/genderedslurs) Please find other colorful adjectives for the objects of your distaste.

To the guys who can maintain a platonic interesting relationship with an attractive female without wanting to go past that, how do you do it?	If a dude finds her attractive he probably would bang her if given the chance. If he says he wouldn't he probably just means he couldn't. And you're not hiding your intentions, you're controlling your impulses as an adult. If you enjoy someone's friendship and don't have emotional attachment you can chill with them like anyone else. It's no different than not raging on everyone who makes you mad or not letting your friend know that his 4,000 "1 like = 1 Jesus" FB shares make you want to castrate him. Self control.	Because you value the similar qualities in them that you do your male mates. You can still find them attractive, but it doesn't mean you desire them. What you describe isn't friendship, its just you meeting someone new and falling for them in some way. I Suggest rather then getting to the "Barking dog" stage you just be confident and tell them what you want.... in a slightly more respectful way then you describe here.
What annoys you more than any fucking thing in the world?	People who sing along to shitty music on the radio. Not just a chorus here or there but singing every song from beginning to end. And on that note, pop-country music makes me want to slit throats.	People that congregate in front of doors or walk abreast on the sidewalk really slowly so that it takes forever to get around them. It's just a totally different mindset than I have, which is to always be looking around to see if I'm in the way. In a twisted way, I wish sometimes I was more oblivious.
Sexually late bloomers of Askmen - how did you do it?	Well i got my first gf when i was 17 and she was pretty experienced. She'd fuck my brains out and i'd just kinda have to try to keep up. Typically there are girls out there who are cool with showing you the ropes because you're inexperienced. Confidence comes with experience. They'll tell you things they like and that are more sure-fire ways to get them to jizz and stuff.	I was a virgin till 25. The nerves will be there matter what. What helped me was finding the right partner who was understanding and patient. That helped a lot because I felt more comfortable and less self conscious. Online dating helped me a lot too. I never went into it looking for hookups, but I'd just grab a beer or coffee and see what these women were like. There's a lot of rejection involved, but don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine. It was EXTREMELY valuable though because it got me more used to talking to women and being myself around them while helping get rid of most of the nervousness/anxiety. Ultimately, it's not a race. Take your time, and have sex when you're ready. Once you make the jump it becomes much less of an intimidating step.
I'm curious about why women moan during sex?	Sex at Dawn believes it's an instinct to lure nearby men over to have Sex after her current partner is spent.	It's like screaming on a roller coaster, you don't *need* to do it, but it feels a helluva lot better to do it.
Do you know a straight adult woman who's never had a boyfriend or is foreveralone? Why hasn't she?	No. It could happen, and I'm sure there are women like that. But it is uncommon because it is so easy for women to get men. Men tend to be the initiators and they're not that picky, so women don't have to do much to find men.	I know several, in fact most of my closest female friends have never dated. What I gather is that they haven't really met men they would like to date. They also tend to be less open to opportunities along those lines, so that hurts them too of course.
Ladies, do you find Reddit to be a sexist environment?	Ummm....Not to be different but no. There are plenty of individuals who make comments that are uncalled for, but I personally have never really felt offended or anything. I also have never felt that things were hostile. Maybe I hang out in only good areas.	I've found it generally pretty hostile. The amount of casual and "ironic" sexism and misogyny that gets tossed around on most of reddit is pretty ridiculous and I find that female voices/experiences/opinions are generally dismissed or ridiculed. AskWomen is heavily moderated for that reason. Most people don't see the majority of the offensive shit that we have to remove here. Or the threats and misogynist rants that target us moderators. So even in trying to run a less sexist space comes with a great deal of having to put up with sexist bullshit.
What is the most hilariously/infuriatingly wrong thing you have ever heard about male biology from a grown woman?	That men and women are basically "wired" the same, sexually. This is bullshit. Women are wired for quality, men are wired for quantity. To prove this, ask *any* woman to approach, at random, 10 men and say, "I'm really horny, and need to be fucked" Ask any man to do the same, with 10 women, and see who gets fucked...	Well plenty of things on this subreddit. But in real life, my friend's mom accused me of having a boner because the zipper area of my pants was sticking out. The dreaded "jeans boner" phenomenon. So I grasped it in my hand and punched it several times to prove my penis wasn't in there.
What's your "controversial" film/television opinion?	The Last Jedi is garbage and nullified any renewed hope I had in a new trilogy that would help wipe the Prequels blemish from my mind. I'm really just an original trilogy fan.	Spoilers. Lily from 'How I Met Your Mother' is a terrible friend to Ted. I had to quit watching the show after it's revealed that she broke up his relationships because she couldn't picture them as elderly friends sipping iced tea together on a porch. (She did extremely underhanded things like leave jewelry out to make it look like Ted was cheating.) Ted, instead of being furious like any rational person, agrees that Lily's 'future vision' makes sense, and that she was right to break up his relationships! What the fuck guys?! Lily can't just, you know, talk to Ted? Ted still wants to be friends with someone so manipulative, especially when his goal in life is getting married? They don't even fight for a whole episode? Shoddy writing about a really shitty character.
How did falling in love feel different the second time around? Was it more intense, less giddy, etc? Do you think it had to do with the difference in SO or because of a change within yourself?	The second time I fell in love I realized what love really was. Someone that respected me, cared for me at my worst, at my best, and was my best friend as well as my partner. It was like a breath of fresh air, like being born all over again. The honey moon phase has seemed to never end for me I just fall in love more and more every day. Or course we have our ups and downs as couples do, but things always set themselves on the right course again. I only find them more handsome every day, more loving, etc. I'm very fortunate. Celebrating 6 years in March...not married yet though!	Falling in love all felt the same until I met the person I would spend my life with. Then, it felt different. It felt consequential. It will always feel giddy and exciting and full of promise, but when I met my husband, it felt like I came home. It's not what you asked, but I hope it helps.
How do I suppress my lust for other women?	U can't dude, its up to u if u wanna rod as many chicks as u want till u get bored or not	Just channel that energy into your sex life with your SO. Thats what I do if a woman gets flirty with me. I may have a brief fantasy in the moment, but then I go home to my gf fold her into a little pretzel and pound all that energy away.
What was the strangest thing you got downvoted for on AskWomen?	Probably when I called out the question "What do you love most about him?" for being heteronormative and ended up with like 60 down votes. Edit: it was -44 down votes and the question was "What made you realize you loved him?" I said >"him"... >A question like this is asked at least every week and generally in a less heteronormative way." Edit edit: haha this is getting downvoted too.. Usually try not to mention that but can't resist the irony.	I argued that Marilyn Monroe wasn't a size 16. She had a 23" waist for crying out loud. That's a 00 these days.
What do you think is the most harmful idea currently taught to girls?	The idea that sex is no big deal. Amongst adults, of course that's fine. But when you have little girls looking up to celebrities, who act as if sex is something casual...that's not good. And then you have little girls wearing these teeny tiny shorts, and crop tops?! We need to teach our girls to respect themselves, because if they don't no one will.	Princess culture. There's nothing inherently wrong with fairy tales and stories about princesses, but I'm talking about the way those princesses are divorced from the context of the story and marketed/sold as just a gown and an attitude. There's nothing about working hard and being humble (Cinderella, Tiana), accomplishing a goal even though it seems unaccomplishable from where you start (Ariel, Mulan), showing kindness and warmth (Belle), establishing autonomy from your parents (Rapunzel, Merida), or any of the other *actual themes* of the stories; without context, Disney princesses serve no real purpose other than decoration. I really hate the way "everyone is a princess" is sold to little girls without the accompanying narratives of having positive qualities other than being pretty and wearing nice dresses.
Have you ever had a good intuition or gut feeling that ended up coming true?	I had a feeling something was wrong in my relationship. Been together for a really long time. Intimacy was lacking, making love had become routine, was sporadic...if at all. Compliments and little gestures of affection had dissapeared. He was protective of his phone...spending more time in the office "working" . I decided to snoop. The password on his computer was changed. WTF? I tried his work laptop, same thing. I tried his phone, same thing. All my bells were going off. I had a computer expert come in and forensically search the computer, it didn't him long to crack the password. I discovered porn, terabytes of it. He was spending up to 9 hours a day surfing the shit. No wonder he kept hand cream on his desk. And the fucking tissues...said his allergies were always bothering him. I learned about porn addiction fast. Thank\-god I listened to my intuition.	I have a happy one! I was 20, in college, and had just started dating a new guy after getting out of a long-term, not very healthy relationship. I was really only looking for a fling, but for some reason I could clearly visualize raising children with this guy. Since marriage and kids were not even on my radar at this point, my response to this was pretty much “what the hell, brain?” Fifteen years later, I’m married to him and we’re raising two kids together. Apparently my brain knew what the hell it was talking about.
Women, what sexual act are you too embarassed/shy or weirded out by to ask your ao to try out and why?	Everyone, this thread is about sexual acts commenters are too embarrassed/shy to ask for, not how their answers aren't that big of a deal because doing it personally turns you on.

What are your holy grail beauty products under $15?	Lemon essential oil for the monthly blemish pop up. Dab that stuff full strength on a forming pimple and it’ll be gone by morning. I don’t really like the essential oil culture, but having grown up in it I did take away a few good things.	vaseline lip therapy (in the cocoa butter). my lips get horrendous in the winter, cracked and bleeding and honestly this is the only thing that can save them. plus it is bf-certified. makes lips taste like cookies.
How often do you take one look at a girl and think "yeah she's cute but there's no way, no need to waste my time"?	Take it easy bro. They’re just chicks man. Don’t put em on a pedastal. They’re totally ‘whatevs’ to me. Most of em are fuckn crazy and gross. I’ve fucked a good few....and they’re certainly not magical creatures to me. In fact I’d rather fuck a Unicorn now that I mention ‘Magical Creatures’.....but you know.....PETA	for every little positive thing i think that would require effort, theres ten times as much push back from myself. if i think a girl is flirting with me, i will spend the rest of the day convincing myself it was all in my head and not to act on it.
Would you sleep with a girl you aren't attracted to?	I would wait till you find THAT girl. My boyfriend was a virgin when we got a relationship ( he was 23 years old), I ( 19 back then) did not care. I personally think you're giving something away that has to be to a special someone, but maybe that's just me. Please think about it though. I gave my PIV-virginity ( I only had one girlfriend before) to a guy who was NOT worth it and it kills me he was my first. But again: I'm sensitive and maybe its just me. Just think about it! And have fun :) Love, Dawn	In my previous non-married life, I avoided sex with people I worked with. Never worth the piles of bullshit. Other than that, go for it.
What is a small thing that annoys you beyond all reason?	I'm beginning to get annoyed at "what annoys you" threads. They all have the same answers. Loud chewing, people who walk slow, turn signals, slow drivers, bad grammar and spelling. There. Thread over.	I hate when I'm unloading the dishwasher and tip over a dish that had trapped some water, sprinkling all the previously dry dishes underneath >:(
My Girlfriend is going to breakup with me. What do I do?	Everybody here saying "go to the meeting", but I'm not sure I agree. Personally, I'd send her a text saying "If you want to meet up to talk things out and you think there's a real shot for our relationship, I'd like that. However, if you're just meeting to break up with me, then tell me now and let's not." Just what I'd do anyway.	How to get broken up with like a mature adult: 1) Show up with your head held high. 2) Have an adult conversation. 3) It's OK to show some emotion, but don't lose it. 4) Say your goodbyes, go home, cry in the shower to a sad song.
How does a girl know when she's a starfish?	When someone tells them. (Un)fortunately most men won't tell women that they're bad in bed. I'm guessing it's because: * When a woman tells a guy he's bad in bed she can go out and find another partner in a month. 2 tops. * When a man tells a woman she's bad in bed he's probably not going to have sex for a while. A looooooong time. For some guys bad sex is better than no sex.	Do you ever take charge? Do you tell him what you want? Do you cling to him, squeeze him, scratch him, bite him? Wrap your legs around him? Do you run your hands through his hair? Eye contact? And yes, sex can be hard. I think a lot of guys and girls are bad in bed without realizing it. It's not just technique. It's also about knowing which techniques your partner likes, and that is pretty difficult sometimes, arguably the hardest part of the endeavor.
What's the closest you've come to dying?	Skiing accident, went flying off trail, ended up dangling upside down off a cliff by my one remaining ski which was wedged between a rock and a tree root. Luckily someone saw me go off trail and was able to pull me up with her ski pole. Yes I was saved by a girl. No, I have no problems admitting that. I send her a Christmas/thank you card every year.	I almost got hit by a train in Holland because I didn't know the train tracks were level with pedestrian walkways. My family friend had to pull me out of the way.
Men, what are some common dating mistakes you've seen girls make?	The only similarities women have with each other is the fact they are women. There's far too much variation to pick out any generalisations. At least in my experience.	Playing 2 guys against each other thinking it will result in some romantic over the top gesture by one of them, when in reality it creates drama and a social cluster fuck.
What are your favorite or most creative date night ideas?	THIS IS WHAT YOU DO: PUT A PLASTIC GARBAGE BAG IN A LARGE CARDBOARD BOX AND FILL THAT WITH WATER. PUT IT IN THE FREEZER TURN IT INTO A HUGE SOLID ICE BLOCK THEN USE THAT TO SIT ON AS A SLIDE DOWN A HILL AND GET PLASTERED BEFOREHAND.	There is a 90s/early 2000s cover band that frequents my area. I love to take people to go see them. Everyone always starts out 'ugh, pop music is soooo cheesy!' But then I catch them humming 'I Want It That Way' and we work our way up to belting out Britney Spears at the top of our lungs.
Do men really not speak to each other in public bathrooms?	It is a taboo. And if you DARE to look anywhere besides your dick or the front wall while you pee, some men in tuxedos will come in, grab you and thats the last anyone will see about you.	It is utterly taboo. You do not acknowledge the existence of other people in the bathroom. The only exception is if you're in the middle of a conversation when you both walk in, in which case you carry on, and do not acknowledge the existence *of the bathroom*. Why? Same reason you don't talk in the elevator. People are pushed too close together (with the added awkwardness of having their dick out). When there's not enough physical space, you contract your social space to compensate.
Just watched the Friends episode where Chandler “moves” to Yemen to avoid dating Janice. What’s the most extreme thing you’ve done to avoid an admirer?	I don't have one, probably because that's a childish game to play instead of just communicating your needs like an adult. What I tell women is "I had a great time tonight, and I would like to see you again in the future. Don't be worried if I don't text you tomorrow because I'm really independent, and I really enjoy my own company. Message me when you get home so I know you've made it home okay."	Convinced this girl i was gay. Wasn't so hard as i got my friend to hold my hand in front of her for about a week. She was a wack job
What is something that people always get wrong about your job and career?	People think I don’t have a heart, but I do. Huge heart. Bigly. Biggest heart you’ll ever see. All the hearts. Everyone...you know...they just don’t understand why myself and PutinKGBlovin get along so well. Probably because of the Fake News Media. - DJTrumplestiltskin	That I understand all aspects of the law, will give legal advice, or will just affirm whatever shitty opinions you have. I'm a lawyer.
Dear men, at what point in the night should we tell you that we have a SO?	Offer him a way to save face. E.g.: "You seem cool, but I have a boyfriend. Tell you what, I'll wingwoman you with those cute girls at the bar." Basically, turn the rejection into an adventure. I mean, you're at the bar to have fun, right?	Although i'm only 18, I've appreciated it when girls just bring up their partners after i ask a question: For example: What are you doing later tonight? "Oh I'm going to my boyfriends house". That way I know to move on. I feel like the vast majority of guys will appreciate that and if we strike up a conversation we are either interested or scoping you out for a friend
Would it bother you if your girlfriend remained good friends with her ex of 5 years?	I'm best friends with an ex of mine. It would be hypocritical not to. I also think that having a problem with the dude is at least partly insecure. Then again, maybe she should use a different word than "love."	It's a problem in this case because he's still pining for her. If it was purely platonic I doubt I would have a problem, but would monitor a bit for warning signs.
What's the story of how you fell *out* of love?	Kept making me choose between her and my friends. She'd demand I go to events for her that conflicted with things I'd set up months and months in advance with my friends. Eventually I realized that this was going to be my life if she was in it, and so she had to leave.	I heard something like, before you marry a guy, imagine that guy as your son. If you wouldn't be proud of him, don't do it. I was already married unfortunately but I realized that I would not be proud.
Do you judge people who wear the same clothes two/three days in a row?	It's unsanitary (to a certain extent depending on what you do), so I would think that you don't have enough clothes and would probably feel bad for you. I don't judge genders differently.	Eh, I wear some clothing items several times before washing them. Like, the weeks I'm working I'll go to work in the same clothes (sweater + trousers) all week, because I wear a uniform at work. At uni I do change my top every day. I feel like people don't notice your jeans as much. They don't know if I'm wearing the same pair of black jeans as I did yesterday or if I own 10 pairs of black jeans.
Have you ever been worried that you were someone's "safe option" or second choice?	No. Partly because I don't really buy the idea of the safe option - they always seem to describe themselves as the safe option when the female partner doesn't want to have threesome's etc like she did with people she didn't care about, rather than seeing their relationship as more than what she had previously. Caring about being happy in the relationship doesn't make you the safe option. But, partly because I don't see how I'd be the safe option. I'm more likely to wonder why they are putting up with my shit.	Of course. I am painfully average - not very pretty, intelligent or talented. Guys never went crazy over me or anything. I am aware that I will never be someone's first choice. I am okay with that.
What was the best and the worst response you received from your partner during/after you had sex?	The good- "You're a god!"😎 The bad- "Seriously? That was it? 🤷‍♂️ The ugly- "Your brother was better"☹️ The Best- "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"🤤	The Good: She stood up out of bed and fell down from jelly legs. The Bad: "Don't worry - it happens to a lot of guys" The Ugly: "Really???? Already???"
What's the worst lie anyone has ever told you?	I'm a guy but: "I'll wait for you" after I went to do my conscription. Turned out she had another guy a month in. She even tried to get back together with me saying: "After you told me you were wounded, I thought you would die, I can't wait forever." "I called you and told you I wanted to see you in the hospital, and that it was a bullet to the arm ffs!"	There are too many to choose from with my dad. "I did check with you about the funeral date, don't you remember?" "I did visit you in the hospital. I brought you lunch. You don't remember?" "I was never unfaithful to your mother." "I can't pay for school supplies for you. Your mother has all my money." "I treat you this way because I love you more than your brother." He's a pathological gas-lighter. It doesn't fuck me up as much now as it did when I was a kid.
You're in a Lyft/Uber. While stopped at a red light the driver turns and hands you a religious pamphlet saying, "I have this little book about how much God loves you." How do you react?	"no thanks, I'm not into fairy tales." Repeat ad nauseum until stop. Get out. Leave a negativity review and contact Uber. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.	i'd probably take it, say "thanks" in a generic way, stare at my phone for the rest of the trip and leave the pamphlet when i leave the car
What does rough sex mean to you?	>I've asked her what she likes and she's been pretty vague Yeah because part of her desire for rough sex is that she wants to be dominated. You asking her nicely what to do kind of defeats this purpose.	Spank her, grab her, press her into the sheets as you stuff her, pull her arms when you enter, playfully choke her. Anything beyond that you need to get to know her better first.
Why does it seem to be accepted that you can get divorced after 10 years of marriage and that's just life sometimes, but if you end things with a partner of 10 years you should never have wasted so much time on someone who wouldn't marry you?	Marriage is just a ceremony. The amount of time people spend focused on that ceremony as a social determinant is just... Sad. It can be an awesome ceremony or it can be perfunctory, but it's just a ceremony. It's not a super mega promise, it's not "the next level of relationship", it's just a ceremony. If you are with someone for 10 years, you can feel it was wasteful, meaningful, or learning experience. It's probably a combo of all of them. Whether or not you performed a celebration some point in the middle, makes no difference.	Because marriage is treated as an end goal, so when you break up with someone before marrying them, it's a "failure" but when you divorce them it's not because you've met your goal of marriage. Don't really agree with that idea but that's the mentality behind it.
Have you ever rejected someone for what seems like a petty reason but it's something that's really important to you?	I couldn't date a guy once because he was just TOO happy and easy going. One time I cancelled our date because I had to work and he was just TOO accepting. "Oh yeah that's fine, I totally understand, it happens to all of us, it's completely okay, we can reschedule.. and he went on and on" I mean, stuff comes up and plans change, and it's good to be acceptingand flexible, but don't ROLL OVER. It's okay to be a little dissapointed and tell me that. I just couldn't date him.	I was driving a dude to lunch and as soon as he got in he started changing all my preset radio stations and adjusting the bass and treble. I asked him to stop and he just laughed and kept going. Never again.
Marriage: Have any ladies decided it simply was not for them? What made you come to the realization?	My mum. She had a few bad experiences (nothing violent or abusive), and now she has the attitude that all men are just as bad. It really saddens me because I know it's not at all true.	Well, in the EU more than a third of children are born to parents who aren't married - in my country it's almost half. Most of those parents are in stable, long term relationships, *marriage* is just pretty optional. I was never raised to see it as anything but a practicality that might make sense, depending on your situation.
I once complained that the woman using the public bathroom was taking too long and it turned out to be Michelle Obama. What minor, coincidental experiences have you had with celebrities?	The Royalton in NYC back when it was new and chic (1997-8-9?). Had to help Christian Slater find the bathroom. It's all mirrors and he had to take an immediate shit or die. He was um sorta tweaking. Happy to have been the one to push the right mirror and save the day. Oh, and I chatted up and fucked Willow Bay that same night, in the same bar (I had a room). By far the best conquest of my life, look her up... National news babe.	I was leaving a concert and turned to chat with my date, the person on his other side was Ben Gibbard. My only response was "Oh my god." Date turns to his right and says "Oh my god." Ben Gibbard "Oh my god!"
Women (and men) of AW, have you ever been stalked on Reddit?	Yep, I've had people go through my history and downvote pages of comments. I actually don't read my PMs at all, because soon after I joined Reddit it became obvious that users saw them as a way to harass me. (I get targeted primarily because I openly identify myself as both a healthy-living fat person and as a health-studies researcher, and I often intervene in Reddit discussions that disseminate false information about fat people, lifestyles, and health. The anti-fat trolls on Reddit are *really* dedicated to shouting down any negation of their "fat is unhealthy" and "calories in, calories out" myths by actual science.)	I had posted a pic of a new tattoo on Reddit once. A user made a comment, and some other user said "here you go" and had found and posted my cell number.
Non-Americans, what is dating culture like in your country? How are relationships formed, and what are the bounds of physical intimacy inside and outside marriage?	From I know about US dating culture is kinda uptight. I am a 23M Brazilian and dating here is... Cool? I mean you can get a girl in the night and kiss or even have sex with her if lucky... Tinder has made all my relationships...and it is mandatory to kiss someone on first date. If you dont you wasted your time. Then for serious relationships it doesnt take too long, after 3 months of solid interactions is safe to say you are dating for real. It doesnt need to be someone you know before, anyone.	I have dated in England, America and in India. To put it in simple words, In America, it’s like “she’s my friend. I can’t date her and ruin the friendship”. In India, it’s like “we’re not even friends, how can we just date?” It kind of makes sense because in India people date thinking there’s a 90% chance it’s forever. And in America there are more chances of people thinking this might not be forever. So yeah you could ruin a friendship.
Question: How do men solve their problems?	>Excessive talk about feelings leads to anxiety and depression. ... What? That's a MASSIVE pile of horse shit. Guys, talk about your shit. Learn to be a good communicator. I've been working on it for years. My "love" scene/personal relationships are vastly more fulfilling. My friendships are more fulfilling. It rubs off on my friends. If anyone suggests you should be less "talky," don't ever take their advise on anything ever. It's a ruse. It's the fast-food of self help. It sells well because it's a cop-out "solution" to what should be a complicated and difficult path of growing up. Too many guys use *"Well, excessively talking about your feelings doesn't solve anything"* as an justification for having absolutely zero communication skills. Don't be that guy.	Uh... by solving them? Your rent is due. What do you do? A) Talk about it. or B) Pay it. One solution solves the problem, the other isn't a solution at all *and* makes you annoying to hang around.
What book made your life better?	The game, It's a pickup book about one of the best pickup artists and his journey learning how to "swoon" girls and get anyone he wants. I found it amazing how he never would have got the girl of his dreams that he loved without pickup but because of pickup he almost completely ruined any chances of getting her.	All of them. “I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson
what specific moment made you realize you were in love?	When she hit me across the face during an argument and I walked off instead of losing my head like I would at anyone else	Honestly - I don’t think I’ve ever had that moment. I do remember when I first saw him, and this is going to sound terribly cheesy, but everything literally happened in slow motion. It was from across a room at a very busy party, but I remember locking eyes with him at some point and it was just: “oh, there you are”. It was this extremely weird feeling of familiarity and ever since then it’s never been a specific moment, it’s just been a series of waves of “ahhhh, I love this human. This is my person.” We’ve been together for 3 years and 3 months now. He still gives me butterflies. I’m going to marry him someday. For suuuuuuure.
Men of reddit, have you ever been overwhelmed by the possibility of getting the girl you are seeing pregnant, that you avoid having sex with her altogether?	If getting her pregnant would be as much of a disaster as you make it sound, then you probably shouldn't be seeing her.	I once was together with a girl who was so .... naive and god damn stupid when it came to protection, that I kinda stopped sleeping with her for a while. E.g. she frequently forgot to take her pill and once she decided not to take the morning after pill after she fucked up because she was on a ski trip and it is certainly okay to take it after 48 hours. I was so sick of the monthly nightmare that I broke up with her. However, we somehow got together again after a few weeks and we switched to another solution. So yeah, pregnancy was a threat to my life plans and options back in the days and it lead not only to abstinence but also to a breakup.
How Do You Feel About Harriet Tubman Replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 Bill?	Completely hate it. Andrew Jackson was a defining president in the history of the United States. He was instrumental in the battle of New Orleans. He had a huge personality that made him well known throughout his time and America would so different without him. Harriet Tubman was helpful in ending slavery but she should not be replacing Andrew Jackson. He deserves a spot on the $20 bill.	My drug dealer is going to have a hard time accepting this, as he does not stay up on current events. This could cause some real bloodshed in the streets!
What's the most underrated city you've visited?	Prague, that place is wonderful. Great food, great beer, great people, great sights and it was cheap as heck too.	Detroit downtown has lots of great bars, a wonderful nightlife, tons of boutique shops, and a hockey stadium. But we like to think of it as worse than Baghdad. So I guess that's underrated?

What is an interesting fact or helpful hint you have learned on this subreddit?	Based on the number of men that answer questions directed specifically to women, I think I've learned that lots of men may think they're part of the womenfolk clan.	Lining the water line of my upper lids has been the best thing ever! I get that thick eyelash look with out the harsh line so perfect for work.
How can I flirt with girls and not make myself the creepy guy?	Situation 1: Guy asks girl out. Girls is uninterested. Guy is automatically a creep. Situation 2: Guy asks girl out. Girls IS interested. Guy is not a creep. And the elusive Situation 3: Girl is interested in guy. Guy is not interested. Girl pretends she was never interested and claims guy was either an asshole or a creep.	Don’t flirt with girls who cannot physically escape from you (if they’re at work, for example). Learn to read body posture, facial expressions, and other nonverbal signals to determine whether she’s receptive to you flirting with her or not. Despite what most guys on this sub will tell you, a creep is not any guy who flirts with a girl who isn’t interested in him. A creep is a guy who won’t take no for an answer and keeps flirting AFTER the girl has shown that she isn’t interested. Girls can be just as creepy imho
Would you consider this cheating, or is my girlfriend overreacting?	We are leaving this thread up, as we feel this is not about relationships, as it is more about ethics in boardgamming.

How often do you hide your emotions?	I have a few habits that sort of combine into me appearing to bottle my emotions. First, I tend to try to focus on any positives of the situation. This is especially true when it comes to an action or reaction related to whatever is going on. Second, before/during that I usually try to gather as much information as possible to inform my reaction. So I go into a detective mode where I kind of detach from the situation and try to look at things objectively. Last, I usually don't feel the need to unburden myself on people unless I really feel I can't handle whatever is going on. I'll be completely open when asked about, but I don't offer anything up unsolicited. Those things lead a lot of people to feel like they need to pry emotions out of me.	If something is bothering me I usually don't tell anyone or just handle it myself. I don't like annoying/burdening people with my problems and would much rather not have people knowing unless they offer to help if they notice it's bothering me. "And know I pop bottles because I bottle my emotions." -Unknown Edit: yes I know these are drake lyrics. It's a joke.
What issue related to feminism or gender equality are you on the fence about, and why?	I would like to see a lot less male bashing. It sucks to observe because I have a son, a step-son, an SO, a brother, friends, co-workers, and clients who are good men and I hate to see all men lumped together as the ultimate evil force. Equality doesn't come by *taking* from one group and *giving* to another group; it comes by making opportunities accessible to *all* groups. Bashing men does not further the feminist cause, and it's a big reason why moderate women like myself stay as far away from the movement as possible--because we have men we love. It's also why men who would otherwise support the cause shy away--because they themselves don't want to be subject to the unfair vitriol.	Embracing periods. I'm all for making them less awkward to talk about and less disgusted by. But free bleeding, period art sets, saving your blood, worshipping menstruation as this big ideal of femininity - I don't get it
What does your SO do that makes you feel like they actually care about you, you're special and important to them?	If I ask him to, he'll feed/change the baby. He supports us. I'm a SAHM. Occasionally he'll text me with "I love you" or something like that. Here and there, he'll ask if I need anything.	He validates my anxiety. Such a simple thing, but no one in my family really fully grasps what happens to me physically when I am anxious. He rubs my back to distract me from my anxiety and sings me to sleep when I'm feeling panicky. The validation alone is the single most important thing to me.
How do you deal with body insecurities e.g. belly fat when getting intimate with your SO?	Obligatory not a woman. So, as a lurker, here's my two cents. Relationships are about communicating. If there's something about you that you're insecure about, and you're with someone you love, poor at least want to build a relationship with.. You need to communicate these things. If your SO cares about you, then they'll help reassure you that your internal holdups are your own, and they don't share your view. It'll not only help bring you closer, or weed out the unworthy, but also help you heal from your insecurities. Though, this isn't first date material, so YMMV 🤷‍♂️	If they didn't like what they saw, they wouldn't be interested in getting intimate. Plain and simple. If you feel like you're not sure, you can communicate to them "hey, I'm kinda insecure about x part of me." Chances are they'll have words of comfort. Believe them! Remember they have free will and they choose to get intimate with you as much as you choose to with them. Think about it from their POV. You're probably not analyzing their body during this time, so why would they be scrutinizing yours during this time? You're in a heated moment and chances are they're not looking/paying attention to that and/or they just consider it part of the whole sexy you.
What's the worst experience you have had with a girl which you were NOT dating?	Lost my hard-on in the middle of the act with this girl. Why? Because I undid her bra and her breasts fell out like water balloons. Poor girl was really attractive but hard the worst rack I'd ever seen. :(	Two girls at a bar I don't frequent got VERY mad at me for not wanting to talk to them after I sat down a ordered a beer. To be clear, I sat down, got a beer after a few minutes of waiting, and they started to be rude after 1 minute of small talk (didn't want to talk because of being tired after a long day). Still confused about it.
If you were turned into a woman indefinitely, what is something you would miss?	Everything? I really like being a white male. I'd miss having every priveledge. I'd miss making more money. I'd miss being able to throw on a rumpled t shirt and jeans and go out, and not be judged harshly. I'd miss peeing anywhere. I'd miss opening the door without checking who it is. I'd miss walking home alone at night without paranoia.	My motorcycle. A sundress looks like the most comfortable and efficient piece of clothing ever made and I doubt I'd ever wear anything else, but it'd probably be pretty hard to ride side-saddle.
What's a strange thing that keeps happening to you during dating?	ALL of the people I've ever been involved with or fallen for, ended up coming from families with serious addiction baggage/are children of alcoholics, and all of them have strong issues around substances. Every one of them. I hope my luck will change now that I'm a medical weed user, haha.	For some reason, the topic of hentai always comes up. I mean Just because Im an anime enthusiast doesnt mean Im into cartoons banging. :(
My girlfriend seems embarrassed when I pay attention to her not-flat stomach, but i like it exactly the way it stands. What to do?	Yes tell her that definitely and often. It most likely won't change her own dislike of it but it will absolutely be great for her self esteem simply knowing and being told of your love and admiration despite her own perceived "flaws"	Like other comments, I also recommend just plainly telling her how you feel about it. However, unlike them I neither expect her to change her view nor judge you if you no longer find her attractive. You like what you like, and she probably dislikes it for reasons other than attracting you. This may just be a sticking point for you two, but unless this is the subject of major complexes you will be happier for getting it off of your chest, and she will feel a bit more at ease in bed knowing at least you like it.
If you've had an abortion, what advice would you give to a person who is contemplating one?	Do it. It's one day of unplesantness compared to nine months of pregnancy, permanent changes to your body, and your life never being the same again. It's horrifying to me that I could have made the opposite decision and destroyed my life on a hormonal whim.	I've had 2. One surgical, one medical. My advice would be to make sure you have someone you can talk to about it and who can also hopefully join you on the day for support. If you are having a medical abortion (pill) , you will likely have heavy bleeding for up to 2 weeks after, be ready with lots of pads and iron rich foods. It is a personal choice and hopefully you don't have anybody pushing you in a certain direction. Do what you want to do, make the choice you feel is best for you and your life. I fell pregnant on 2 separate occasions despite being on birth control both times. Accidents happen and I don't regret my decision to terminate my pregnancies at all. I wish you the best of luck no matter what you choose :)
How do you deal with other men hitting on your attractive girlfriend in your presence?	It's disrespectful and it can very easily lead to violence. My reaction depends on how I perceive the other guy - Is he weaker or stronger than me? Does he look like a man with a tendency to violence? etc. Usually in a situation such as this I will let my body language speak instead of my mouth. For example I will stand very close to my woman in order to convey a message of *"Move along. She is mine"*.	"My girlfriend is deaf, but I can hear you just fine." Seriously though, everyone who said let her handle it is right, but if she gets cornered or is uncomfortable go ahead and give her an out. "Hey babe let's go dance/get a drink/make out in the corner/make babies!"
I can count on not even 2 hands how many times my boyfriend of 2 years has gone down on me. I'm super duper shy when it comes to sex stuff, idk how to ask these things. How do I properly ask my boyfriend to go down on me without getting rejected/embarassed?	Sometimes in sex you won’t get everything, I know it sucks, but that is life. My wife does not offer good sex to me. I never worried about it.	Get him on his back, go down on him and then just swing yourself around and over his face. A little 69 to start. Or just ask him to.
Does anyone actually dislike going down on a girl?	If she smells clean which basically means no odor than I think most guys are open to it. Some vaginas really, really do smell bad.	There are a lot of situations. Some girls love giving blowjobs. Some don't. Some guys love going down Some don't. There are even guys who don't like getting blowjobs and women who don't enjoy cunnilingus. But IMO if you expect to get oral sex, you are expected to "give back"
Guys seem to think they are more desirable when taken because they look good when someone wants them. I think it has more to do with the more "equal" way they treat women and men in group settings. Your thoughts?	Men seem to be preoccupied with "value", which is a notion I find kind of creepy. Also your hunter/hunted analogy is a little convoluted, but I think I get it. That said, I'd say the desperation thing is kind if true, because guys can get very weird when they're trying to get laid. It's more comfortable to talking to someone who's taken because they're not turning every moment into "you're really gorgeous, can I get your number?" And then the fact that women are talking to him makes the man perceive that his value goes up, which makes him more confident.	I am personally more likely to talk to a guy who is taken because I'm only looking for friends anyway. If I'm taken and he's taken, there is a much, much lower possibility of my friendliness leading to an awkward asking out thing. So, yeah, they are more desirable, but more desirable as a friend.
What fanbase prevents you from being a fan of something you would otherwise enjoy?	Nothing? I could care fuck all for the fans of movies or books or games, regardless if they're annoying or not. I like what I like and I don't really care about the people who like or dislike the same things.	I really enjoy both Harry Potter and Doctor Who, but I actively avoid interactions with fan-based stuff because people take it way too far. Can't I just like something for what it is without dissecting how it's connected to other things in some obscure way?
What are the top signs that a girl is insecure about herself?	If she says anything about her inner goddess or how she is a lioness. Always shares thoughtcatalog articles on Facebook	I can't give you a whole list, but a big one is: If she really, *really* wants people to know how little she cares about their opinion of her. Like, it's a top priority.
Men in their 20s, what’s a development in your life teenage you would have never seen coming?	Heartbreak and coming to terms that the life-long relationships of the generations before us are dead and gone. It forced me to become a selfish person when I didn’t want to be because kindness and loyalty are no longer appreciated. But in my selfishness I gained a level of reverence from people that I’d never had before. It makes interacting with people hard because I’m just not a dickhead at heart, so every relationship in which I wish not to be disrespected at some point seems fake and forced, and every relationship in which I wish to be kind and selfless seems like an exercise in how much pain I can take. I learned quickly that people aren’t for me.	Turns out grown up me really loves cooking, and with that, I really like shopping for new ingredients to cook with. Teenage me would certainly be raising an eyebrow.
How do you feel about the term "mansplaining"?	It's a cop out that roughly translates to "I'm supposed to know more about this topic than you because I'm a woman, but I can't prove that I do."	It's a classic [Kafka Trap](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kafkatrapping). Even if the phenomenon exists (and it likely does to some degree), the term itself is not a useful linguistic tool, but rather a rhetorical weapon.
What is the dumbest thing you've cried about while you were on your period?	Why condescending questions like these get upvoted when we are trying to fight the idea that women are irrational during their periods? I certainly never cried for something stupid on my period, or felt that my emotions were out of control. And then we wonder were people get their sexists assumptions. Sigh.	My boyfriend said I'd used up all my kisses and that I wouldn't get anymore. I was so upset, it was insta-water works even though he was clearly joking. He still teases me about it
How do I give my wife the Hairbrushing To Rule All Hairbrushings?	Honestly not completely related, but perhaps something else to fidget with would help? Try knitting (or crocheting, etc), it really helped me with pretty much the same thing.	First of all, I have this problem too! If your wife is interested, point her to /r/trichsters and /r/trichotillomania as both are small but positive and useful communities. Second... Start at the bottom. If you encounter a snag, don't just yank it through. You have to sort of tease it gently until it untangles. Working from the top will only cause more snarls. If she's getting manicures anyway, may I suggest gels? They're extremely smooth and I find that they make it very difficult for me to grab hairs to pull... Also they're durable as all hell, which is nice.
How often do you get asked out in real life?	It’s sad that the majority of answers are never. But, never. Guys just don’t seem interested in the “date” anymore. It’s sad really.	Actually asked out, like "Can I take you to dinner?" is rare. "Do you wanna hang out sometime?" is less rare but not *often.* Trying to actively hook up with me that night happens *all* the time. Who said romance is dead?
What’s the fastest you’ve quit a job? What was the reason?	First fast food job I ever had was 22, Was there 1 hour on 1st day, got Arby Sauce on my new sparkly white tennis shoes, cried, quit, went home. Lol .	Two days in retail. I hate when jobs lie about the position and it turns out your job relies on opening credit cards.
What are your unpopular sex opinions?	People on Reddit tend to put too much emphasis on the woman's pleasure. Like for example whenever someone asks for advice about having a small penis guaranteed all the comments just say "get better at oral/fingering" instead of actually helping the young man's self confidence. They act like sex is literally just being a human vibrator for a woman or something and not two people expressing their passion for each other.	It takes time to build sexual chemistry and giving somebody the hook after a bad outing isn't fair. I was talking to this lady on hinge and she said she wanted full on tantric love making... right out the gate. Like dude it takes some time for me to build that sort of connection with somebody. I can't throw 100 down the pipe without a little warmup.
when watching porn, how often do you try to cum as the same time as the guy in the video?	I don't watch heterosexual porn, even though I'm a heterosexual male! I'm all about solo and lesbian porn... Soft core, mostly. Can't stand the sight of someone else's dick. I hope I'm not the only one with that... Problem.	This is hilarious to me. One weird thing I think is hot, is the moment when people change positions. A couple banging away in the same position gets boring after a while, but when they stop, pull out, change positions and stick it back in turns me on for some reason.
Asian women of /askwomen, have you ever encountered men that want to date you purely because you're Asian?	Just saying, I've been fetishized as a white man a few times by Asian women. It's a two way street.	A fellow on OkCupid recently said to me that it's "that's neat that you are of Chinese origin. I don't know why but I've always wanted to be intimate with a Chinese woman, hehe" It makes me uncomfortable because it makes me feel like he expects that I'll have some defining Chinese characteristics.
Who was the truly nicest guy you've ever met, and what was he like?	Honestly... All the men in my life have disappointed me, even the “nice ones”. The only men in my life I can count on are my stepdad and grandad, they give me hope I’ll find someone nice one day.	He adopted our friends kid the day we knew she was dying . He helped her through the process of wills and everything and made sure she didn't have to worry about the after. She spent her last days being able to do her bucket list with her child, with money he provided. He set up a trust for her child with everything he had in his savings so that she can physically see that financially he was covered. He asked her to write a book of her wishes for her son so that he can carry them out and raise him in a way that she would like. He helped her write letters and birthday cards for her son and they celebrate her birthday, mother's day, etc so that she is always a part of his life.
How do I make/keep male friends without them becoming romantically interested/assuming I’m romantically interested?	I guess just be the one they won't think of. Like be ugly, be revolting, be a little too honest, mock them, anything off putting, just don't be too normal. You don't have to do it all the time, just occasionally to put them in their place.	I can't speak for all guys, but if I had a great female friend I got along with, cared for and was attracted to... Well those are basically the qualities I look for in a gf. I don't know what to tell you. I'll risk a friendship for more. For every one guy that actually does ask you out, there are probably 5 that don't have the courage to do so.
I just bought my first leggings after realizing they really are super comfortable. I was wrong and you ladies were right. What other great trends am I missing due to my assumptions?	You were definitely missing out with leggings! They are so great. I don't know about other trends you're missing out on but one thing's for certain: don't try high-waisted shorts! They make your ass look like a pancake :(	Trend I'm getting on board with: maxi dressed and rompers are basically pajamas, or sweatpants. So comfy, just throw them on, lie in bed and eat cheetos for an hour, look amazing. You heard it right here folks.
What male character in all fiction is just the WORST?	So most of the people so far are talking about straight up villains, but when I saw the question, all I could think was HARRY POTTER. He was just so whiny and made super stupid decisions all the time. I get that he was a kid, but he never learned from any of his mistakes ever and people died because of it (SIRIUS BLACK: NEVER FORGET).	Victor Frankenstein. He's just so self-absorbed, affected, arrogant, completely lacking in empathy, entitled, and whiny. Everything that goes badly in the book doesn't go badly because of his creation, but because of his giant jackass personality. I really enjoyed the novel, but it was one of the only books I've really struggled to finish solely because of the awful personality of the main character.
Has anyone else ever been called out for.. and I quote " not acting like a real woman"?	Maybe it is not about you beeing a women. But going to a fucking restaurant with a weapon behind your back is sort of weird in my opinion. Hell i would feel more unsafe when everybody who is a cop off duty + some other guys carry weapons arround everywhere they go. Honestly if someone robs you the best thing you can do is give them your shit. A weapon will heat up the situation unnessesarily. But maybe its because european and i will never get the american weapon thing.	My mother has often commented that I can't be a 'real girl' because I don't stuff my face with chocolate, watch or read romances or enjoy cooking. An ex boyfriend told me I was 'more like a man than a woman' because of my taste in music (?!) and my interest in martial arts. I choose to carry on doing my thing, trying to give as few shits as possible.
What was your "well,this is who I chose to spend the rest of my life with" moment?	It was just after we had gotten married. He had never done it before we got married, but he started doing passive aggressive stuff. He would go for 2 weeks without talking to me and I would never know what I had done. We have been married 25 years now. He still does it, but not as much, probably because I don't give a shit anymore if he's pissed about something he won't tell me.	Heard a bit of a commotion in the living room last night (bf is having a few beers) went through and he had scratches all over his forehead?? Turns out he tried to wear the cat as a hat and she didn't like that much...he's 33. This is what I have to deal with. Plus he starts a new job today.
Have a great girl to date except not really attracted to body type. How can I get over this to be 100% content with her?	lol, i am the opposite of you. while i appreciate a small nice body with small boobs i have a big boob fetish and am fine with the overweight as long as we are not talking too much. at some point it is not healthy.	If you date her when you aren't attracted to her, you're doing a disservice to both her and yourself. And IMO, if you're having to work this hard to feel attracted to her...it just isn't happening. For the record, I've made this mistake with guys, thinking it's okay I wasn't that physically interested because they were otherwise great. Both times it was a mistake, I couldn't "teach" myself to be turned on by someone who just didn't do it for me. (Btw, I'm assuming physical attraction/compatibility is important to you, but I know some people don't consider it quite as crucial in a relationship as I do.)

What is your guilty pleasure type?	There is no type of person I am attracted to that I couldn't bring home to see my parents. Men or women; so long as they're not abusing me, my parents don't care.	[Claire Underwood](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/81/85/67/81856743838e17a33d56888df885eb5a.jpg) from House of Cards. She's a psychopath as is her husband and she's like twice my age but good god I find her so freaking sexy. She's also classy as fuck and I pretty much want her entire wardrobe.
How can I stop using profanities so much?	My friend swears a lot. I told him, I won't talk to him if he keeps swearing. He's introverted and only talks to me. I tell him it's lack of self control and immature. Just remember to reevaluate yourself. Take a step back and ask yourself if you were talking way too much.	Try recording yourself saying them. Realise how boorish you sound. Experience the split-second cringe whenever you're about to say the profanity. Over time you'll eventually kick this habit.
What's your "right person wrong timing" story?	My current boyfriend. We met through a mutual friend freshman year and really liked each other but never got to hang out since he lived a couple cities over. we always kept in touch but finally started seeing each other romantically senior year but since it took him and hour or more to ride his bike to my house and because we both became too busy, we slowly stopped seeing each other. I was heart broken, id always loved him to death so 6 months later, as soon as i got my car, the first thing i did was drive to him. It took over 4 years for us to end up together but worth the wait. We live together now but i remember all the nights we stayed up all night on the phone and how i'm really lucky to wake up next to him every day.	My last Ex. Graduated with her Bachlor's trying to get her career started and I was just barely re-starting community college. We had a lot in common and had good chemistry so we dated. 9 months later she got a temp job in another state. Tried to make long distance work, but she didn't wanna do it anymore. I don't hate her, but man moving on has been difficult.
Do you ever get drunk alone with someone of the opposite sex while in a relationship?	Yes. Why wouldn't I? Is the implication behind the question that I (or you) cannot control yourself when drunk and will pounce on any friend in the vicinity?	I basically don't do anything that I think would bum my SO out if she knew about it. That's the only real guideline i have.
Ladies 20 and older, what are your experiences with teenagers trying to hit on you?	I am fat and apparently give off a kind of motherly/grandmotherly vibe in person (despite the fact that I'm not even in my thirties yet), so thankfully it doesn't happen in the real world. Every once in a while some kid will try to chat me up online, and when that happens I just laugh at them and then block them.	It's usually a really quick "hey, would you go out with me?" kinda thing where I'm pretty sure they're only partially serious, so I just smile, say no, and go on my way. One time, though, when I was drawing at a park, this 15 year old skateboarded up to me, started a conversation, then slid onto the bench next to me acting all suave. It was adorably hilarious, like watching a puppy learn to walk. When I realized he was not just making friendly conversation (I'm slow sometimes) I dropped my age, which he took in stride, so then I mentioned my husband. To which he said "aw, man, you're married? Well, it was nice to talk to you!" and skated off. Kid had game!
Who is the cheapest, stingiest or least generous person you know?	Probably me. I don't like spending money on "things". I like meaningful gifts, so I gift meaningfully. Sometimes that means a really cheap handmade gift, or something that made me think of you, but was a $10 gift. One year, I was broke and managed to ten people Christmas gifts for $80. I tried to be thoughtful and get things like a gift card to the movies ($25 for two people) for my sister and BIL with a note that I'd babysit for them that night.	My dad. Whenever we go out to eat he wants to bring my grandma so that she ends up paying for all of us. There have been multiple times that he's complained about things being too expensive even to our server a couple times as if they could do anything about it. But then he will order the most expensive thing on the menu for himself but of course he ignores that logic.
Got girlfriend pregnant. Abortion is set for Thursday. How do I be supportive?	Just two small things. 1. Does she want the abortion? 2. Having a baby young is not the end of the world. If you think you can realistically do it (not that it would be easy), would you permanently commit to the woman and your child? Just food for thought.	My best advice would be to remember that being support doesnt mean showing no emotion. Don't worry if you feel yourself getting caught up and crying. Sometimes to understand that someone feels the same way as you do can be the most comforting thing in the world
From a guy's perspective, what would your thoughts be if you found out your friends GF had a crush on you?	1. I'd lose quite a bit respect for her, and see her as a friendship-wrecking, manipulative beach, 2. I'd let my friend know what's going on, 3. *"In my opinion, I think crushes like that are almost inevitable."* No dear, they **ARE NOT**. For you, hanging around a friend of your guy means you need to be crush-y/flirty with him? WTF, man?! >What would your thoughts/reaction/opinion be if you found out a friend's girlfriend had a crush on you? I'd realize she was the type of person to sleep with her SO's best-friend if the r'ship ever goes south. And I hate beaches like that. **PS: Although my comment might have come off as sexist, but I'm an equal-opportunity hater in this regard. I deeply hate/resent the lazy/classless assholes/scumbags who 'crush over' their friends' gf's as well...**	Flattered, but I would redouble my efforts to be really cautious about being alone with them or anything like that. I know that I wouldn't do anything like that, but sometimes people like to draw conclusions, so I would avoid putting myself into a position where I could even possibly be seen as getting involved beyond just being a friend.
What's the shittiest and most unthoughtful gift you ever received from an SO?	A backpack with colored pencils full of various office/school organizing things. It was awful but I plastered a shit-eating grin on my face and pretended it was exactly what I had needed.	Ex wife (wife at the time)modeled some lingerie for me. Found out later she had let her boyfriend fuck her in them and made a video of them fucking before she let me see her in them.
What is the best experience you have had in your life so far?	Honestly? Not a single event in my life stands out. I've been largely unhappy my entire life. I've fought suicide and depression for my entire conscious life. I'm unhappy and miserable, to be honest. I don't have a "best experience". My best experience will be when I finally die and I can be done with this shit life and shit existence.	Back in high school, me and my friends wandered off during a school trip, we were supposed to stay in a museum, but for a few hours we went exploring, it was the first time I felt overwhelmed in a big city and the feeling of doing something wrong, while having fun with my friends and looking at all those massive buildings gave me a satisfaction I never felt before. The rest of the trip was epic as well, at the end of it when we were back at the bus, my best friend back then said to me ''You know, at the end of every day in my life I feel like I had one day less, but today it felt like I gained a day.''
Parents, how have your sex life changed after having kids?	It's the same. Doesn't happen. I am not with her dad. Haven't since she was born. Don't have a live in SO. I'm also asexual so I don't really give it any thought until I see questions like this.	It is like being a teenager again, except instead of trying to find a place where my parents won't catch me, I'm trying to hide from my children.
What rules do you follow to avoid coming off as a creep?	Aside from the most obvious actions: * if you're ugly/poor = creep * if you're handsome/rich = romantic Most of the stuff that you see in "romantic" movies, if done by the average guy IRL = creep.	If you're getting on a elevator with a woman push the button for your floor first before you offer to push the button for her floor. That way she doesn't think you're following her if you happen to be headed to the same floor. If you do go to the same floor, get off the elevator first. That way, you won't be following her down a hallway or wherever.
Would you date a girl who dyed her hair unnatural colors? Why or why not?	How could this possibly be a deal breaker...? You're gonna not date someone because of the color of their hair? I'd say that's a little shallow.	On a dating app, I'd probably swipe past. If I knew her first and she was cool, not a deal breaker. Historically though, have not been impressed with people that change their hair colour frequently, or have an obnoxious shade.
How much alcohol did (or do you) consume in your mid 20s? How much is too much?	That's how alcoholism starts. I know what I'm talking about. 30 years later I am 2 years DRY. Alcohol ruins a lot	what is "normal", though? that's definitely not normal for _me_, but what does that mean? that's just not what I'm into. besides, when I do drink beer, I usually drink the kind of beer that would be tough to drink 5-10 of. but again, every person is different-- I have friends that drink zero as well as friends who drink at least as much as you describe. question: what has prompted this? are you perceiving some issue, or does it just "sound like a lot"? just curious.
At 25 years old, would you date a younger person and if so, what's your cut off?	I started dating an ex when I was 25 and he had jusssst turned 21. If he had been 20 that would have been fine too, but I wouldn't have gone younger than that.	I don't have much of an interest in younger guys, but I wouldn't be completely opposed if I met someone I clicked well with. My cutoff would be 21 because I definitely couldn't date someone who couldn't legally drink.
What are some reasonably masculine non-alcoholic drinks for someone recently on the wagon?	Lapsang souchong tea. Smells like a camp fire, tastes like a camp fire. Stare into it and ponder life, then take a sip.	Tonic with lime. Plus is no one will know you're not drinking gin and tonic. Another side bonus - it glows in the presence of a black light. Or soda water and lemon (or lime).
What fashion trend can you just not get on board with?	LACE. It was gorgeous when Prada did it, beautiful when the Victorians made it work...But since lace has become popular in mass fashion, it just looks cheap and flimsy and tacky.	NORMCORE. Ugh. I'm tired of seeing expensive dressy sweatshirts every where in stores right now. We've gone from "Homeless or Hipster?" to "Bankrolled or Baglady?". :P
Have you ever received advice about romance or sex that made you a little sad for the person giving it? What was the advice and what did you find sad about it?	A lot of comments on AskMen make me...sad. Not that they're sexist and it's not against the commenters individually but so many men seem to see relationships as somewhat...transactional? Obligations to be met, rules to follow. It makes me sad because of a society that makes them think it had to be like that - is the opposite of how I view relationships, which is based on trust, love and partnership. There's nothing specific or glaring but they talk about women as if it's a 1+1=2 kind of thing, it's completely different to how I see women talk about men on here. Does anyone else know what I mean (and can maybe explain it better than me haha)?	From a very, very religious friend in high school: "You don't have sex for *pleasure!*" It just made me feel super sad because she made it clear that she expected her lot in life to be getting married, staying home, and having as many kids as possible. And that's cool if that's your jam, son! The thing that made me sad was that she viewed it as her Sacred and Irrefutable Biological Duty to lie there and think of England so she could have oodles of kids because "there aren't enough [insert her religious group]s in the world!"
what is the creepiest thing that has ever happened to you in your life?	That's hard to say because I used to have some panic stuff \(you know, freeze up\). Probably going down into a supposedly haunted tunnel.	I was 16 and got off at the wrong bus stop. A man who had been staring at me, muttering and snapping his fingers got off at the last minute with his massive suitcase. I got a bad feeling and took off running towards a bar at the end of the street and the scariest moment of my life is hearing those suitcase wheels speeding up behind me and his feet hitting the pavement. Luckily for me the bouncer at the bar was helpful and told creepy guy to turn around and walk the other way. Creepy guy tries to convince him that we knew each other and were just having an argument. Bouncer doesn’t care and asks a couple of his friends to follow this guy and make sure he doesn’t turn around and come back towards me. That unknown bouncer is on my list of heroes.
Do you feel physically uncomfortable when a girl is sitting/laying on you?	At least in America, 123 is definitely below the average, especially for someone who's 5'7. In general though, it's generally pretty comfortable to have a girl sitting/lying on you with a few exceptions: -She's sitting on my thigh in just a way so it's pushing right down on the bone -She's pushing down on my non-empty bladder -She's laying on my arm in such a way that she's cutting off circulation -She's a bony girl and her hips/butt feel like knives Other than the last one, those are easily rectified. You're not as heavy as you think.	I was on a date and she wanted to snuggle in the theatre. I'm wearing layers because it's December and I feel the sweat coming in the pit she is resting in. Then my arm goes numb from lack of blood. I asked her if she wanted to reposition and she said she was fine. So I let it be. Moana was the longest movie of my life.
Men with 6 pack abs: how hard did you have to work for it?	I've heard the saying that "abs are made in the kitchen". I agree for the most part, but you can't lose weight by only eating right. You have to work out and eat right. What has worked for me was doing the exercises I wanted ( at first it was arms then cardio.) but over time core stabilization and eventually back workouts. When it comes to fat loss, you have to be in a caloric deficit. You'll get there eventually but you have to work at it for at least month to truly notice a difference.	To have them look fairly lean, it's not too hard. However, to get them extremely lean, it gets very difficult and is exponentially more difficult. Mostly diet and genes
My female friends advised me that I shouldn't shower my boyfriend with so many presents because men do not like to be taken care of like that...men, is this true for you?	It depends. If the sex is inadequate, yeah, I'll be totally put off and pushed away by nonsexual affection. Physical affection is the primary need I'm looking to fill by getting into a relationship, so that has to be satisfied before I can appreciate nonphysical forms of affection.	Unsolicited advice: don't take advice on how men think or feel from women. Women are not men. They don't know how we feel. This is why Cosmo is nonsense. Women telling women how men think. You wanna know how guys think, ask guys -- like you have here. Even better? Ask **THE** guy. Your partner. Ask *him* how he feels. It's entirely dependent on the individual. I, as a person, find it difficult to accept help, gifts, or compliments from people, friends, and partners. Family environment didn't include that sort of support. So getting that stuff now is unfamiliar and trippy. It's something I need to work through.
what are some of the best decisions you have made in your life?	I started lifting about a year ago. I used to be one of those girls who never wanted to pick up a weight but my friend finally convinced me to do it and I became addicted. I never knew how empowering it would be to be physically strong. I'm slowly getting my female friends to lift and they're enjoying it too (:	Seeing a therapist. Went from having disturbed sleep every night for half a year to no troubles. I no longer freeze in panic/anxiety in lots of situations. I learnt how to be more open with my wife and have a much better relationship for it Asking a doctor to help me and getting the referral was one of the best things I ever did.
Whats something you and your SO are constantly at odds about?	We get along very well 99.9% of the time. We're never "at odds" over anything. We'll disagree on how to accomplish a goal sometimes, but we usually find that a combination of both our ideas works pretty well. Maybe your SO had an unfaithful SO in the past? That could make someone paranoid about their partner being on the phone when they're supposed to be sleeping.	If a day goes by that I don't have to put a diet ginger ale can in the recycle bin or pick up a pair of motherfucking socks, it will mean he has moved out.
Ladies of Reddit, regardless if you've actually had children, what are your favorite names that you'd use (have used) for your real/hypothetical children? Least favorite names?	I HATE children, but I like the names Charlie and Olivia (after Olivia Dunham obviously). I could type out the names I hate, but I'm sick and it would be at least 100 names, and I'm sure someone would get offended by one of the names on the list.	I'm a teacher so my list of names I'd never give a child is super long - I've taught too many kids called Craig, Darren, Joshua, Dylan, Sean, Emily, Chelsea, Skye and so on who were absolutely poisonous little toe rags. So many names have been wrecked for me! A colleague had a baby recently and spent most of her pregnancy agonising over names that she liked and that didn't have terrible associations for her.
What are your biggest pet peeves at work?	Noisy people and people that gossip. I guess when you're privileged and raised in white neighborhoods it's the norm to get involved in situations that you have no business being involved in. I ask a person out discreetly and made a mistake posting something on social media , then half the office knows. Worse part is when people you don't even know or communicated with is giving you dirty looks but you can't say nothing or approach them because you're in a professional environment. I always shutdown any gossiping that people bring me into on the spot. I've seen too much people get dragged into unfortunate situations because they're involved in something they have no business being involved with from the jump.	This one drives me insane. I missed the last meeting, so if we can just rehash everything we did in that meeting while I object noncommittally to every point that was agreed upon without offering alternatives, that'd be greeeaaaaat.
What ways are your pets assholes?	My roommate's cat is the devil reincarnate. Walk past her? My leg just got clawed. Go to the kitchen? She screams incessantly. Go to let her out? She stares out the door for 30 seconds before haughtily deciding it's not good enough for her. THE LITTLE SHIT.	My Border Collie should have been a Jewish grandmother, because she is amazing at making my husband and I feel guilty. "Oh, you're going out without me? That's alright... I'm sure I'll be ok. But just in case you come back to my rotting corpse, know that I loved you very, very much"... I hate it. HATE IT!
My lovely boyfriend[22M] talks to his mother 5-6 times a day on average, is this normal for you guys?	Who cares if it's normal, if it isn't affecting you/the relationship in a negative way I don't see the issue.	Normal? Not by any means. If the closest person he's had his whole life is his mother, then if he ever gets excited about something I don't see it being out of the ordinary to contact her about it. If it's a problem or not stems on how potentially invasive she is (if she's attempting to be controlling or anything) but if it's just him going to the person he's close to, then it's no different then me being excited to tell my best friend about something. Although the frequency can be considered weird, but again if it doesn't bug you, no harm no foul.
Women with bigger chests, have you ever found a strapless bra that actually works and doesn't break the bank? If so, where did you find it?	I would strongly suggest Triumph. Their bras are extremly high quality for a very reasonable price. I've only been buying bras from there for the past 6 years, even still wear the first one that i got around the house. They have really comfortable and supportive strapless bras in a variety of colours.	Girl I just got my ass out of bed to dig it out of my drawer to tell you. Lilyette and it’s by Maidenform. I came across it at a thrift store(new with tags) and for some miracle it actually works! I won’t say perfectly, I only wear it for nights out, I couldn’t like wear it with a tank top and clean my house or do anything chest active haha but it totally holds up to a night of light dancing. If I had like a desk job I would trust it too, as long as I don’t need to bend over too much.
What is something you desire sexually but you feel like your partner wouldn't?	She tie me down in the kitchen table and have her way with me while beating me all over with jumper cables	I can't find it, but somewhere there is a little test that asks you all these kinks, and you answer "would like to try, don't want to try, indifferent, or willing if partner is", and you both do the test without seeing answers, then at the end it only shows your answers that are the same, so there isnt the awkward "how do you feel about rape role play?". Never would have guessed my girlfriend would be into it. Edit: wow this is my top comment now! Thanks guys! Keep it kinky!
What's something about yourself that you feel is constantly unappreciated or misunderstood?	I'm a gamer, and my job is modeling. Geeks are condescending towards models. Models are condescending toward gamers. I have no friends	One of the most hilarious realizations I've ever had was when it was pointed out that I'm seen as being a very laid-back person. I have an anxiety disorder, I'm prone to panic attacks, I'm high strung, and have recently realized I actually present most of the major markers for obsessive compulsive disorder (haven't pursued treatment or diagnosis though, so it's just a theory at this point). I think I come across as very chill because I'm constantly trying to maintain some sense of calm, but nobody sees the constant internal screaming and panicking that's happening in my head. Edit for clarity: the possible OCD diagnosis is not something I've checked into, however the anxiety and panic disorder are diagnosed, medicated, all that jazz.
Women of reddit, have you ever had an ex commit suicide after break up, either shortly after or years later? If so how did you feel about it?	All please let people share their stories and assume they are giving the details they want, rather than pressing them on what if's. Thanks.	All please let people share their stories and assume they are giving the details they want, rather than pressing them on what if's. Thanks.
Women who are unintentionally single and/or socially awkward: how do you find navigating the dating scene?	not a female here. but topic caught my eye and just chime in and say forget all the comments telling you how to attract, why to date, how to date, etc, etc. screw that. if you're quirky, it's for a reason. you're different. be picky, chase your dreams, cherish your time, most of all be you. it's time to shift the paradigm.	Hard. I know I would be an awesome girlfriend and a wonderful wife, but it's getting to that point. Men aren't interested in me, I'm very plain looking and shy.
What was the straw that broke the camels back in your last relationship? What pushed you to end it?	She made lasagna with cottage cheese instead of ricotta. On purpose. To be fair, that camel didn't have a strong back to begin with.	The last one was when she went to South America for 6 weeks for a friend's wedding. I was invited, but due to work commitments and cost I couldn't really afford it. We'd been growing apart, and that I didn't really miss her when she was gone was telling, we were living separate lives, and not really what I wanted as I was approaching 30.
Do you self-identify as a feminist? Do you believe in equal rights for men and women? If so, do you like being taken out on dates where the man pays?	I without a doubt self-identify as a feminist (as all women really should, but that's neither here nor there). Who doesn't believe in equal rights, honestly? If I am asked out on a date, then he should pay. That being said I have NO problem paying for myself, and wouldn't think any less of a man if I paid. If the man is the primary earner and the woman is okay with that, as in she doesn't want/need to work, than that's fine. I only take issue when women aren't "allowed" to work, or are called bad wives/mothers for working.	I consider myself both a feminist and a MRA. I like most people and I think all people should have equal rights. Anyway - Sure, I like being taken out on dates when the man pays. I also like other dates where I pay for the man. Going dutch is also acceptable. I'm fine with a man being the primary earner in a household. I've lived with two men in the past and I was the primary earner in both situations, so I haven't really encountered living with a man who makes more than I do. I don't think paying for dates or earning more money is condescending to one party or the other. Some people are better able at some skills and some are better able at others. Sometimes those cross traditional gender lines and sometimes they don't.
How big of a red flag is it if your SO lies about their whereabouts?	If you're partner is the type that like privacy it might be nothing. Might also be red flag. I like privacy and I really dislike if someone ask me were i am going, what I have done and what I browse on the internet and so on. Usually I have no problem telling them but if its something i am not to proud of I do not want to talk about it. But if I had a really close partner it would have to be a person I would share almost anything with.	Lying is a deal breaker, especially about something like that. If you're lying to me about where you are you're probably doing something I won't like. It's a compounding problem that will only get worse.
Do you think women care about how fast we respond to text messages?	"Women" have no consensus opinion on this issue. Lots of people care and pay attention to that stuff, lots of others don't. My policy has always been that if somebody judges me for responding too quickly, they're a shitty person anyway.	I think women think about things I've never thought about before and I think you should ask them how they think because I don't think I know how they think but they know how they think. I think.
Men who have cheated but were never caught or confessed during the relationship, what are your thoughts and feelings on your infidelity now?	I cheated on my wife and sorry to say but it was pretty great! It was with a coworker in a parked car once every two weeks or so. The anticipation was amazing, made me feel like a teenager again! Once things got normal, we called it quits and I went back to my loving wife! Wins all around!	I cheated on my ex a few times. The guilt you feel really eats you up, to be honest. You know you're a bastard for doing it. I regret doing it, I should have broken up with her sooner, and did my own thing. I don't recommend it.
Men, How do I deal with my gf's guy bestfriend who liked each other once?	I don't believe guys and girls can be best friends after liking each other. There's history and sexual tension there. All it needs is a bit of alcohol and he'll be balls deep one day and then you walk in the door. It sucks bro, but it's the reality.	I became friends with the guy. He is really cool and we actually get along quite good. We've been talking our experiences with her and there's no hard feelings from my side of the story. He might hate my guts for all I know but I like him and he is open about the relationship they had.
What do you want for your birthday?	If you're stuck on what to get someone get them a small stuffed toy or animal. Me? I want a car broom broom. Bday in 2 days whoop.	I really want to take carpentry classes. I've recently started doing some light carpentry work, and I want to gain some more experience so I can start making my own furniture. Plus it would be a fun thing for me and my SO to do together.
Do any guys find it hard to cum from a blowjob?	First off, if they act like it's a chore or if they are doing me a favor then there's no way I'm coming. Also, a problem for me is that I last a good 10+ minutes and most women are too lazy to give head that long. If they have skills I can come faster, but they usually aren't very good at it. I will offer instruction if she's open to it, but some women are just better at this than others.	I do but only because there's not enough pressure from her mouth when she's not using her hand, once she gets the hand action in there then I'm good to go. I don't get a lot of them so my biggest problem aside from that is getting out of my own head.
Whats the scoop on the current drama happening amongst your friends or family?	My SO wrestles in a local ladies amateur wrestling group. Her wrestling partner is unhappily married and has been having an affair with me (my SO and I are in an open relationship). Unfortunately, my SO's wrestling partner recently confessed her love for me; I broke the wrestling partner's heart when I rejected her proposal to leave her husband to be with me. My SO was understandably upset by this proposal. Consequently, there is now a real adversarial tension between my SO and her wrestling partner that has been motivating their incredible wrestling performances. *"Woah, they really seem to hate each other! They are phenomenal actors!!"* tldr: My life is basically the Netflix show GLOW (except I'm not cheating on my partner).	My cousin and her boyfriend told everyone they were getting married. They planned to just get married at city hall instead of having a wedding to save money towards a house. They posted pictured of themselves in city hall with their friend who was the witness. Afterwards, the entire family met up for dinner. During this dinner, we all gave them wedding presents. Most of us opted for cash. My grandmother alone gave them $7,000. The next week, they moved to Texas to be closer to his family. Three weeks later, it comes out that they didn't actually get married, and faked the entire thing. The "husband" got angry that she wasn't sharing the money equally and snitched to the family. All the family members have been talking this week trying to figure out how much money they scammed from us, and it's around $12,500.
Do you think you'll ever get to be the Best Man at a wedding?	I was asked to be someone's best man. Later I found out I was just one of the groomsmen. Was still pretty cool. They only lasted a year anyways.	After my best mate told me he was thinking of proposing to his gf I was happy for him. But after a day I thought "oh crap. I'm his best mate which means I'm gonna be his bestman! I don't know what to do if it happens..." haha
What perfectly normal thing annoys you?	People who pronounce often as off-tehn. Soften the “t” in often. Take out the hard “t”. You wouldn’t say sof-tehn. Do the same with often. I’ve heard presidents, scientists, and journalists put a hard “t” in often and they sound like idiots. Very aggravating.	Office culture. It's like being on a first date from 9-5 every day. No one is truly who they are in real life because that shit would not fly in real life. All fake interaction and have to be friendly with people you'd never associate with in real life.
Who's the theoretical guy you're competing against in the dating world?	I'm not going to even bother with someone who is considering multiple people. If they go on a date with you and then decide to date someone else, your chance is done. It's over with.	I'm in a committed relationship right now. However, when I was dating, I felt like the other guys had all of my strengths, but none of my weaknesses, and they can speak three languages, and have amazing abs, their back never hurts, and they always know what to do.
The Charleston shooting is just another in a long line of mass shootings committed by young men. Is it possible to help our boys and prevent further violence?	Growth of feminism, meant destruction of the male role model. Bring back families and good parenting and this will take care of it self for the most part.	Stop plastering their faces and their life stories all over every media outlet and news network for weeks on end. Stop grabbing every damaged and downtrodden little boy that the world forgot to care about by the eyeballs and showing him that "this is how you become famous; this is how you make the world remember you exist." Hours after his capture every child in America knows what Dylan Roof ate for breakfast, but can anyone here remember the name of even one of the victims without looking it up?
What happened that made you realize life isn’t fair?	I'm 30 and never had sex, compared to some guys who have no problem finding it when they want it.	I know good people who died young, and I know pieces of shit that are in there 80's and still spreading misery.
When you haven't had sex for a while, does horniness/sexual desire eventually dissipate or does it keep growing?	There's seems to be a cut off point around 3 months. When it exceeds three months, it's like my body admits defeat and just goes like "welp, we tried but this bitch is striking out so let's put our feet up."	I'm currently in my longest drought since before losing my virginity. Generally it's fine, but every 4-6 weeks I get in a horny mood that's hard to shake. Lasts a couple days to a week, then I feel fine again. As the time has gone on it's gotten easier to manage, because I expect it and know it'll pass.
What's the most patronising thing that someone has ever said to you? And how did you respond to it?	Open discussion in my sociology class. When I was saying that, as a woman, I'm not oppressed, the guy I was talking to told me I was too oppressed to know better. One of the few examples of "mansplaining" I've ever experienced, ironically.	I have a friggin' PhD in engineering, and this male coworker, who does not, offered to "help me with the math" in an article he suggested I read. I told him about my degree until he scooted backward uncomfortably out of my office. I'm still steamed though.
What makes a girl "marriage material"? and at this point in your life, does it matter if she is or not?	I'm 26. I'm not looking for marriage, but life partner potential? * Beautiful. * Fit. * Variety of hobbies, the more physical the better. * Has a job she is passionate about and is good at. * Doesn't want kids. * Can put up with my bullshit.	I'm not interested in getting married anytime soon, but for a girl to even remotely register on my radar for it, she'd need to be: 1.) Someone I can consistently rely on and trust. 2.) Someone that is financially independent. 3.) Someone that I can share lots of my interests with. 4.) Someone who takes care of her mental and physical health. At this point in my life, with me having no interest in matrimony, I'm pretty flexible on this, but honestly, these are the ideal traits for any romantic partner, marriage or no marriage.
Bar tenders/baristas, what is your least favorite drink that people order? Why?	This is a bullshit thread. It's all people complaining about easy as hell drinks to make and complaining about how they have to take a few extra steps besides serving a beer/coffee. It's like a chief complaining about someone ordering a meatlovers pizza with pineapple. It's your job to make drinks: if it takes more work you charge more and make more, what is there to complain about. That's the job! If you don't like it get another job jeeze	Anything that gets made in the blender. I'm assuming this goes for both bartenders and baristas. It's noisy, it takes longer than just shaking a drink, it's honestly kind of difficult to make sure you're going to get great consistency on the first go no matter how experienced you are (I swear, 3 ice cubes too much/too little can throw a whole drink off), and then it's a pain to clean. I also hate making anything that I've never heard of. Sure, it can be a fun challenge with the right customer, but most of the time it's someone who had something on a cruise with a made up name, and my close approximation isn't close enough and they send the drink back.
Any other guys totally repulsed by the traditional idea of a bachelor's party?	No, I am not totally repulsed by the "traditional idea of a bachelor’s party". Where I am from, strippers and that sort of thing aren’t all that common anyway. But I don’t see anything wrong with it. For men who actually have real life sexual appeal to women, the sexual exclusivity part of a LTR and/or marriage *is* a "necessary evil". Most men are happy to make the trade-off when they have found a great woman. But most men who are actually able to obtain sex without months of courting, will to some degree feel the sting of no more variety. And that is what the "ritual" of strippers, lapdances, etc. etc. symbolizes that the groom is saying goodbye to.	FWIW I've been to around a half dozen bachelor's parties. None involved a dancer grinding up on the man of the hour, and only one involved a strip club.
How normal is it for a girl to NEVER initiate anything during dating? How do I get this girl to be proactive?	Bitch, she aint into you. Think about it like this. Let's say you were a really hot guy (ex. Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, etc.), do you not think she would be eager to text and initiate plans with you?!? She's not into you - move on.	ITT: The behaviour that she's showing is either clear evidence that she's into you or clear evidence that she isn't LOL
Ladies, what's one beauty skill you can never seem to learn despite multiple attempts/tutorials/etc?	I have the worst time applying false eyelashes. On the rare occasion that I wear them, I have a friend do them.	*Wear your hair in a bun while you sleep and you'll have glorious beach waves by morning* NEVER works. Always horribly dented and I just end up washing it so it doesn't look like shit.
What was your, "Oh... apparently that's a dealbreaker for me" moment?	He wore the same pair of Dockers to our 4 dates. The guy made good money, and was decent looking. But, dude, put some effort into it. I also found out he coveted Lego sets. He was 37...	Family money. Money sounds great right? Until you're an adult and you have to ask for it because you've never had to work. I never thought I'd grow to hate the idea of dating a man with money but it turned out he didn't have any freedom at all. He scoffed at minimum wage but had to ask for gas money.
How many of you guys can sew? How and why did you learn?	Of course I know how. Learned how to do that and bake in home ec. Wasn't aware this was rare or a secret as pretty much everyone I went to school with learned how to do both to some extent.	I knit and I sew. I learned really to mend my own clothes. Im not much of a fashion person, I just wear what I like and what is comfortable. And I _hate_ clothes shopping. So I'll just wear items until they fall apart enough I can no longer mend it back together without looking like some weird Frankestein's monster type thing. I learned knitting as an excuse to hang with my female friends, they used to have stitch n bitch once a week, knit, gossip, drink. Plus its something for my fidgety hands to do instead of smoking (coming up on year and a half. o_0) I've recently scored a sewing machine, so oiling that and learning to thread and use it is my next thing. Cue the repurposed clothing -> produce bags, etc.
What do you wish women would just GET about men?	The the more sexual partners you have, the less desirable you are for long term relationships. I mean you know it too since you lie about your partner count.	That we're allowed to have insecurities and that doesn't make us bad people. No, I don't want to meet your exes. No, I don't want to think about your sexual history. Yes, it bothers me seeing facebook pictures of your past relationships. And no, these emotions don't make me misogynistic, controlling, immature, whatever. **Everyone** has insecurities, that's part of being human. I'm all for managing my insecurities in a healthy way, but it's wrong to shame me for having them in the first place.
If you have had a threesome (or moresome) that included your SO, what was that like emotionally?	We're having MFM, MFMF, MFM+ rather regularly and sometimes I (being male) can watch her having FF or FFF. It's strictly on a sexual level for us, we both really enjoy it, but we also have great sex when we're alone. So no bad emotions or other stuff for us. We did lose contact to a very nice couple since their male part couldn't handle the situation.	It was fun at the time, but quickly got ruined. The girl we slept with was my best friend. Things between her and I were fine and remained fine. (EX) BF turned into a shithead about it and tried to turn EVERY interaction I and friend had into "YOU GUYS SHOULD START BANGING NOW!" ...Like, dude, read the fucking room. We're talking about the impending diarrhea from TacoTacoTaco and trying to beat Katamari. Stahp.
Have you ever kicked yourself for missing out on a sexual opportunity only to realize as you got older that you actually dodged a bullet?	I don't kick myself for my past, however as I have gotten older I have begun giving fewer and fewer shits about sex or my sexual history. As long as I'm getting off regularly enough that I'm not fiending, I'm good. I'm more concerned with other aspects of my life than the sex I am (or am not) having.	Fuck no. The more crazy fucked up sex you have, the more you can look back fondly on it while you're jackin it in the handicap shitter at work.
Today is my 35th birthday, and the first thing I heard from a friend this morning was "hate to say it, but your age is showing." What's the worst thing you were ever told on your birthday?	Maybe not the worst thing, but akward none the less On my 25th birthday I invited some friends to a local pub where most off the staff knows us. The new waitress comes over and asked me my ID, all my friends and some staff members started laughing as I and the new waitress just stood there akwardly as we didn't knew how to respond to that.	*Why aren't you married already? You don't wanna die alone, don't you?* (I especially love this in passive - agressive tone.) Every Birthday for about 3 years now. I'm 26. Also, last year: "Your wrinkles are showing. You should use a cream for this. You're 25." Like, the day before I looked just fine, then it's my Birtday and suddenly, over one night I got wrinkles?!
I'm about to give my 12 year old brother the sex talk. What do you wish you'd been told at that age?	Honestly, I feel like the talk should come from another male but if you're gonna go for it, go for it. He may already know a thing or two. When I was 12 I knew what sex was and that I needed condoms for it, I didn't exactly know the motions, or what a vagina actually looked like, I just knew sex was sticking my dick one. My friends all talked about getting "the talk" from their dads so instead of waiting I asked my old man. He said "Well, what do you not already know?" The only new thing he told me was not to let her parents catch you, they can try to get you charged with statutory rape.	* Practice with a condom by yourself long before you try and do it with a girl in the room. * Don't take, send, or keep naked pictures of yourself or other kids. * When jacking off vary your technique over the years and avoid the "death grip". * Don't be friends with other guys who play fast and loose with consent. * Girls who like sex aren't sluts, they're the ones you want to marry.
Ladies, What subreddit that you discovered in 2017?	Over the summer I discovered r/letsnotmeet. I binged all the top posts over a weekend, and visit that sub every few days just to see the top posts of the week.	I've personally had a blast after I discovered /r/wewantplates and also /r/disneyvacation which isn't about disney at all but funny captions for those stock drawings on "how to do stuff" webpages. Hilarious stuff
Looking back on your childhood what are some things that make you go WTF!?	I never listened to music until i was in Grade 8 - literally never knew any famous singers or such I wore really long socks when wearing shorts, I still to this day don't understand how or why I did that I thought every movie had an intermission - (i'm brown and living in Canada at the time lol) I Thought Katy Perry was black - again never listened to music so I didn't know who she was either Girls used to talk to me when I a kid - looking back at it they were flirting with me [my reaction now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H22t-tiWiLw) Not childhood - I thought my penis was average since asian men aren't usually known for big dongs until very recently I lost weight and measured it - [lemme say I have no more self esteem issues now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEA33bAXyNM)	No allowance and no food in the house was for us. All foods and snacks were theirs and we had to ask for permission. Came home hungry, mom was at work, dad was still asleep (worked nights)? Too bad. Couldn't make a sandwich without permission. I remember being so surprised when visiting friends and they'd just get a snack from the kitchen without asking.
Have you ever met a famous person? What were they like? Were they down to earth, or super rude?	Yeah, lots. They kinda ran the gamut, honestly. The one thing I did find is that the rudest or most pretentious people weren't the actually famous ones, it was the people who were more... fame-adjacent? Like they were almost famous but not quite. They had a much higher likelihood of being insufferable, I found. Like they were clinging so hard to the scrap of fame they had, that they needed to prove it to everyone else.	Amanda Bynes. Years ago when I was a teen. Before she had a decline. She saw me standing. Hoping for an autograph. I was too shy to ask. But she came up to me. Asked if I wanted one. Took pictures with me. And was super kind. It's sad she's had some issues lately. She was lovely when I met her.
Your girlfriend says she's hungry, what do you do?	Say: now that you mention it I’m hungry too, (kindly give her a small kiss) then continue saying “make us some sandwiches honey “ and send her her way with a slap on that ass .. it Works!! And don’t forget my fav drink darling.	Me: “What do you want to eat?” Her: Has a complex list of requiring 4 different stops at completely unrelated food locations. “I don’t know.” Me: “What don’t you want?” Her: Still has that list. It does not feature Chinese takeout. “...I don’t want Chinese.” Me: Starts listing every restaurant in a 10 mile radius. Her: “...actually... now that you mention it, I haven’t had Chinese in a while.”
Seriously missing my ex lately. Can I hear your stories about how you met someone ever better than an ex you thought you'd never get over?	My husband and I broke up for 5 months when we were 7 months into our relationship. I was upset and we didn't talk until months later. I was determined not to get back together with him because he's the one that broke up with me and now 4 years later were as happy as can be and married with 2 dogs and a cat.	I'm sorry that I don't have any advice. I'm in the same situation and I'm still feeling hurt and abandoned. In my mind, it will just take time. I keep myself busy with work and spending time with friends. Having a support system is essential however, I understand that the pain is still there. Stay positive, we will get through this.
Tips for women being on top?	These guys are saying more grind and horizontal stuff. Well that dosent hit all my buttons. Bouncing up/down, kissing, eye contact, scratching, biting, punching (like down on the chest and not too hard just sexy hard), hair whip (just like one whip every five minutes. hand placement, different bounce intensity, changing positions using the other hole, ball fondling, licking (you may want to talk about that first, and best of all being vocal. Say some freaky shit. EDIT: y'all are so nitpicky.	A lot of women just bounce straight up and down. Getting some horizontal movement in there really helps, and kissing and doing mouth stuff while you're on top makes it so much more intense.
My friend can't seem to get a girl and he seems to be slowly becoming depressed over it. What can I do to help him?	Get him to a gym, dress him in decent well-fitted clothes, take the best pictures you can (stage activities if necessary), help him write a witty profile, and get that dude on tinder. Unless you're in a small town or he has unrealistic standards this should work. r/tinder is a gold mine of ideas and recommendations. Get him some books on communication, sales/business stuff, self-help, and dating all have something to offer; you need to sell yourself, you need a healthy self-image, and learning about women doesn't hurt either. Most importantly try to help him internalize that his value as a man isn't tied to his ability to date. Women will come and go many times in most men's lives.	I gave up. I stopped doing things to impress others and started doing things for myself. Concerts, going out on the town, whatever, but by myself. You get used to it. You can’t force anyone to like you, either they do or they don’t.
Have you ever lost attraction to a good looking woman because of something she did or said?? What happened?	I had a female best friend for about 2 years at the end of high school that was fairly attractive. I had no interest in her at the time but she went out of her way to hardcore friendzone me for about 6 months. (remember I had no interest) It pissed me off and stopped any attraction I had for her. At the end of our friendship, she started getting feelings for me and i didn't care at all anymore and turned her down because of it.	First date. Early in the date, she said her boss was driving her crazy. I didn't think much of it. A few beers later, she says that her boss keeps asking her out. I think, hmmm that's a lot of baggage but not really her fault necessarily. We go to my house, and she mentions that she sleeps with her boss regularly. Uhhhh...nope.
What do you think is the worst part of having an opposite-sex best friend?	You can't have a girl best friend if you're not gay... You can be friendzoned and pretend like a bellend that you're best friends, but deep inside you'll be always thinking about shagging your "best friend" 🤣	When you're at an event with long lines to the restrooms, you have to stand separately while waiting. Then one of you will get through looong before the other and you just have to stand around doing nothing.
Men of reddit who’ve dated or are currently dating a disabled partner (blind, deaf, physically handicapped, etc.) what is it like and how did you start dating?	I used to date a girl in a wheelchair. She was funny, and it was great, we met when we got in a car wreck and I broke her spine.	Not a crazy disability but I dated a girl with a glass eye - she had an infection of some sort as a child and had to have one eye removed. She had some minor difficulties but managed to learn how to drive and all that just fine. She had the best sense of humor about it though. Back in the early 2000’s before emojis we just sent smiley faces like :) and ;) and so on. However she always just used one dot like .) and ,)
Did dating get better in your 30s?	I met my husband after I turned 30. I told him on our second date that "this will sound crazy, but I want to be married and have babies soon. If you're on that track, then we can continue dating. If not, we need to cut this off." Edit: We were married(courthouse) 9 months later, wedding 1.25 years later, and pregnant 3 months after that. I GOT WHAT I WANTED!	This thread and the infertility thread are making me onion-eyed. I just turned 30, and am single for the first time as an adult. I stuck it out with the wrong people for too long. Despite being in a large metro area I'm having very little success with online dating. I want to marry and have kids, but my optimism is rapidly diminishing.
What was the most misguided notion you had about relationships until you were an adult?	I thought things had meaning or actually mattered. I thought love existed. Or that people would give a fuck about personality or reciprocation. It's all about what you can give and what you're willing to take. Looks, money, presentation, that's the most important thing. Anyone who says different is a fucking liar.	I thought that the way to be in a relationship was to do everything I possibly could to make the woman happy... By being somebody I wasn't; sacrificing my own friends, hobbies, social life... I basically felt like that's how life worked. So as soon as I got my first proper girlfriend I started trying to change myself. Hide my geeky and "immature" hobbies, be somebody I wasn't etc... "Geeks don't have girlfriends"... Or, only the rich ones do, y'know. Thank fuck I was wrong.
What is the correct response when a 9 year old girl says she is "trying to lose weight"?	A 9 year old girl who weighs 105 lbs (47.6 kg) is definitely overweight and definitely needs to lose weight. It's good that she is conscious of that. However, if I were her parent, I would do my best to do that without making her feeling ugly or affect her self-worth. If she tells you that again, say something along the lines of "well, you should make sure to eat plenty of fruit and veggies then" or "drink less soda and more water". Give her nutrition advice instead.	If it's someone else's kid? "It's always a good idea to try to be healthy. I'm trying to be healthy too. What kind of healthy food do you like to eat?"
Let's be honest...how painful is childbirth?	I'm not exactly an expert here, but you're getting your private parts ripped open essentially. I'd imagine it hurts like hell.	I've only given birth once but I had an epidural. Started out not very painful, like light menstrual cramps every few minutes. Then got progressively more painful. Once I hit the "I'm not sure how much more of this I can take" pain threshold, the anesthesiologist came and gave me my epidural. Easy as pie after that, I didn't feel a thing. I was singing along to the oldies station I had playing on the radio between pushes and chatting with my stepdad.
Sexual assault survivors: how open have you been with friends, family, etc. about your experience? How receptive have people been and do you regret either speaking or not speaking up?	I've never told my family about it, but two of my friends know. If I'm on a social media platform where I can be mostly anonymous, I talk about it. I don't regret telling my friends and I don't regret keeping it from my family. It's been years at this point anyway so bringing it up to them now would serve no purpose other than to hurt them.	I'm public about it on Reddit, but I don't mention it anywhere else, and I barely bring it up in therapy. I never reported, and I didn't because I don't hate myself that much, and I didn't need any additional trauma to get to the same results. I don't feel bad about not letting my family know. Some things you just gotta take to the grave. Unless I see one of them in public, because then I'll be taking the both of us to the grave.
Men who had kids after not wanting them for years, how's that working out for you?	Not quite what you're asking, but my ex girlfriend got pregnant a while ago, around the time when we broke up. I've always said I don't want kids and I still don't, but she got an abortion against my wishes and I still hate her. In my mind she'll always be the bitch that killed my child for convenience. I was willing to raise my child on my own if she didn't want it, but she wasn't willing to do that. I still think it's fucked up I have 0 say.	Pretty good actually. I had a son and it turns out he doesn't like kids either so we got that in common.
Metalheads of r/askwomen, what's your favorite band and can you link your favorite track/song of theirs in your reply?	I can't really narrow it down to a track, but I can narrow it down to [an album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwDKjNurbZM). In This Moment's album Blood. It's great and I highly recommend any of their other albums. I may have heard one of their new tracks from Black Widow, but I'm not 100% sure, it only came out last year. It's good stuff! Their older albums are more exclusively metal, and the newer ones Maria is experimenting with blending genres; which may or may not be your thing, just a heads up Edit: [Link to the Black Widow album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUH-pezEnNg)	Mastodon- [The Last Baron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pvfQtUhtNE). I've also been really digging the [title track](https://youtu.be/tI81VTGTdaU) and [Asleep in the Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBXWBj7hIzg) from their latest album, *Once More Around the Sun.* Ghost- [Cirice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Ao4t_fe0I) [Monstrance Clock](https://youtu.be/6oa_nbgE8M8) and [Prime Mover](https://youtu.be/S5R7BrL9kt0), dat bass intro! (I can't pick just one, I LOVE Ghost!) Leviathan- [Scar Sighted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42e2WWu6EJE) Baroness- [Rays On Pinion](https://youtu.be/5ZoroxNLTxk?list=PLMox641TG-te1NBwpU72Bib-xyrfB50th) Ruby the Hatchet- pretty much the whole of their album [Valley of the Snake] (https://thehatchet.bandcamp.com/album/valley-of-the-snake-3)

I'm a very emotional Male; what is your cutoff between endearing and "being a baby"?	It's the same for me man haha. I cry on many Movies/TV Shows. The last episode of The Office, just damn. "Michael I can't believe you actually came" , had me in fucking tears but totally worth it. As a guy, I think being emotional makes us experience the world in a different way, so don't be afraid of it. I haven't had a girl tease on me or tell me off for crying on something like that :)	I'd say the cutoff is crying at everyday annoyances. 'Spilt milk' level stuff... that's just too much for me to deal with. I cry at every sad part of every movie or tv show or podcast, so I don't judge about that sort of thing.
Women who use dating sites, what determines if you reply to a message on a dating site?	The message they send me is a huge issue. If it is a "what's up" or "hey", they get deleted right away. That is not how you speak to a lady you are attempting to court. And it's just really annoying. Women get bombarded with messages, some are rude and distasteful (never ever respond), some are just hey (never respond). The one's I respond[ed] (no longer on dating sites) actually put something unique from their profile in their message, pointed to something in mine, and seemed genuine - not like they copied and pasted the same message to 80 women.	The things I would consider, in order, when deciding if I wanted to respond: * Do I think he's attractive? * Do I feel like he actually read my profile and is trying to start a conversation? * Can he compose a message with complete sentences and correct grammar? * Do the answers to his questions (I was on OkC) indicate any incompatibilities I'm not willing to compromise on? * Do I like his profile? Generally, though, everyone would get a reply, even if it was just "Thank you, but I'm not interested."
What's your one beauty secret, that now you know you'd never go back?	Have a baby. Now you not wearing makeup, looking like you haven't showered in a few days, and are wearing the same clothing as yesterday with a mystery stain is perfectly acceptable!	Sunscreen, every day. Doesn't matter if the sun is out those uva rays are everywhere. I only wish I started sooner though!
What is something you realize you'll never be able to do?	Fit in with the social cliques. I'm not a social outcast or anything, but I don't really follow the whole, "let's go to parties, get smashed, smoke weed and fuck as many girls as we can" routine. It's just something I can never bring myself to do, no matter how "cool" films try to make it out to be. I'm 18 now, turned so 2 days ago, and if anything, I'm starting to appreciate my individuality more.	Leave the planet. I think space travel, even once commercialized will remain something only the extremely wealthy can partake in.
Mothers of AskWomen, what are some of the "mom things" that you thought you would never do but ended up doing it anyway?	I would never be "that mom" and force others to watch video after video or look at photo after photo of my kid, especially when people CLEARLY don't care. But now... "Hey do you have time to watch this super cute video?" "Oh, I'm actually running out to do a thing right now..." "Oh ok then I'll only show you these two short ones!"	Crying. I never understood why my mother always cried when me and my sisters were accomplishing stuff at school or during sport events. Especially if we had a show at school and had a solo. She's so emotional and would always feel proud. + during weddings and other "emotional" events - she would be the one sobbing. Now I cry all the time. Thanks mom.
What weird part of social interaction do you genuinely not understand?	I think it's silly for us to keep archaic customs that no longer serve any purpose whatsoever. Do we really need to shake hands? You're no longer assuming I'm concealing a weapon if I don't hold my hands out. Do we really need to "bless" someone who sneezes? We don't think they're dying of the black death, or in danger of losing their soul. I think it would be great if our society could figure out how to move on and stop bothering with things we really don't need to bother with any longer.	How to deal when you see an acquaintance from afar you haven't greeted yet, and both of you are walking towards each other. What do you do during that part of the walk where you can't talk to each other without raising your voice too high? I always pretend I don't notice them until the last second, and then I go "hey! How are ya?" only to not be able to talk to them at all until the next day.
What’s it like to leave a high powered or high paying job to become a stay at home mom?	I don't think you could call teaching a high powered or high paid job, but I left that job to stay at home with my son. I'm also pregnant and due any week now. It was the best decision I ever made. My mental health has improved so much, I'm no longer constantly stressed and crying, my relationship with my partner has improved exponentially. We both value as stress\-free a life as possible and didn't see the point in me working if it was going to cause us more harm than good. We were more than willing to sacrifice a little extra income to improve our personal lives.	I left a 6-figure US$ job as a cancer-researcher to stay home with our baby. My husband did the same. We estimate we have 4-6 years before our financial situation requires us to go back to work. It's fun watching our daughter grow, be there for her firsts -- first step, first word, first run, first time going up stairs, etc. -- at this point, she's 20 months and babbling non-sense, but we're looking forward to making sense of it very soon.
How do you prevent losing yourself in a relationship?	Have your man put a GPS tracker on your phone. Then whenever you get lost, ask him to help you.	Those are two different questions, I’ll answer the question in the title. Don’t go into a relationship looking to be “completed” by somebody. It’s important to know and be sure of who you are first and your partner accepts that person instead of having somebody try to mold you into what they want you to be and in turn losing who you really are. Great question!
Women of ask men, being honest, what do you want to know about men?	Ladies, subreddit rules still apply to posts. We can't tell you if the guy in your history class is madly in love with you because he accidentally looked at you twice, of if the barista wants to fuck you because he doesn't charge you for an extra shot. Those types of questions will be removed.	Ladies, subreddit rules still apply to posts.

Just took a cab, alone, the locks were shaved off, is the legal?	Creepy, to be sure, but not unheard of. You seem to taking this much more seriously than I think it warrants, but to each his own. If this bothers you enough to complain to the company and the police, try to see it from another perspective first; how would you resolve the issue they are trying to prevent? (Just food for thought. Not trying to invalidate you're feelings in the least.)	I definitely agree that it's sketchy and I certainly wouldn't want to ride in that cab. *HOWEVER*, if I had to guess at the motivation behind it, I'd bet that the driver is trying to avoid people who ride and run out on their fare.
Do you think girls have a right to be mean and extremely rude just because they are on their period?	No, obviously not. People who are depressed don't have a right to lash out at people if they are hurting, so the relatively minor emotional impact of being on their period certainly isn't to justify it.	if they are irritable and grumpy it's one thing, but if they are downright rude they have no excuse there
Women who were mean girls or bullies in their school years, how has this impacted you as an adult? What measures have you taken to grow from this?	My current best friend says I bullied her in middle school. I remember feeling like she was excluding me from her new friendships and tightening down on our old group. We didn’t exclude her but I think I did rub in the times we hung out that she wasn’t there. I honestly don’t remember being cruel or mean other than that but she insists I was. I know sometimes I say things before I think about how they might affect someone. Like not super obviously but I think I do lots of twisted compliments? I have ADHD so sometimes I vet something mentally and then once I’m home I’m like oops maybe shouldn’t have mentioned that. Or if I feel attacked or defensive even if it’s not done on purpose my gut instinct is to bring the other person down too. That ones been hard to work on.	I learned that it came from a place of anger and misunderstanding. Someone called me out for being rude, and I realized I was being an ass. I just tried changing how I held onto that anger. Learned that it was doing me more harm and think twice when I’m irked.
When will men realize that dick size rarely matters?	I learned this fairly recently when I started getting insecure. From what I've learned, there are women who crave the big penises but theyre definitely the minority. Also, guys seem to be hung up on the length when most women I've talked to say girth matters more. Anyway, most women can't orgasm from PIV sex alone anyway. Foreplay is definitely important. One of my female friends said that if you know what to do with your mouth and hands, you'd be golden. Besides, apparently most guys who have huge trouser snakes seem to think that alone makes them a sex God. It's apparently just 5-10 minutes of jackhammering and minimal foreplay lol.	You gave hope to everyone with a 3 inch dick and then yanked it straight out of their hands Kidding aside, some things people will always be insecure about, and I feel like most women walking the developed world today understand that very well.
Does anyone else keep buying nail polish but hardly ever use any?	I don't buy anything I'm not going to use, if I find an item that I haven't used in a certain time period (Depends on item, nail polish would be like 4 months) I donate or throw it away. Rarely happens though.	Yes, of course, there's always that chance I'll HAVE to paint my nails a horrendous burnt orange. I have more nail polish than I care to admit..
What behavior do you engage in that might be perceived as a red flag? What's your explanation for it?	My general mode of socializing reads as flirtatious to many people. So if you don't know me well or aren't used to people like me, it looks like I'm flirting with everyone. I'm really religious, but also a liberal artist type. This means I tend to be a problem for people on the more extreme ends of both religious and artsy/intellectual communities. Luckily I found people who occupied a similar middle ground to date and eventually marry.	I tend to get needy too fast. I like texting and talking on the phone when I can with someone I like. I have a huge fear of being forgotten, but I also really want to spend as much time as I can with that person cause I want to make them my whole world. (yes I know that's not healthy either, but I live a lifestyle where it's normal)
Whats the hottest thing a girl does that's NON-Sexual?	Someone who actually tells you when something is bothering her instead of being an insecure passive aggressive womanchild and expecting you to magically figure out what's wrong	I think it's super hot when a girl is genuinely interested in whatever we're talking about and makes a lot of eye contact. I'm a pretty introverted person and I'm pretty self conscious so someone being super into me when there's other more interesting people to talk to gets me going nicely.
What is your shallowest/pickiest red flag in a potential partner?	Stupidity. That Repulses Me In A Girl So So Much. No Intelligence = No Good. That Is My Biggest Red Flag.	Women who pass judgement on your job/salary while they are working a minimum wage job. Major red flag of entitlement...
how to avoid being the nice guy?	"I am not entitled to sex just because I think I am a decent human being" (spoilers, everyone thinks they're a decent human being) Repeat this phrase as nescessary	Don't be a fucking incel and be a decent human being. Girls like guys who are nice, but not guys who expect a reward for being nice.
Men, because I am a male I feel like I'm inherently creepy in any action I take towards women, even simply looking at them in passing. For those of you who don't have this perspective, what tips do you have to help me see past this?	It's because many many women say that about just about anything you do if you are not attractive to them. It's a cultural flaw that probably stems from the hijacking of feminism and claims of this nonexistent rape culture they go on about. Just ignore it. Do what you would do if you didn't have those feelings.	You're fine, mate. We're both fine; have these sorts of anxious thoughts from time to time. Here's the deal. They notice you a lot less than you notice them. While you take one glance at them and think a lot of things, they likely just see another face and then move on to think about what to do this weekend, or how they need to buy a new TV, or how wonderful it's gonna be when the summer comes back. If someone wrote a book about their life they wouldn't even mention you as they walk down the street, they'd use that time for inner monologue. You are always aware of yourself. Other people are almost never aware of you, and the awareness of you they *do* have is likely to disappear a few seconds after you're out of sight.
Former broke ladies of Reddit: When more money started coming in, what did you buy or upgrade first? What was lower on the list? Did you start spending less in any category? Ladies who are still broke, what's at the top of your list for when things get better?	When I first moved by myself out of state, I was so poor I was buying groceries at the Dollar Tree & only eating one meal a day to stretch it out. The second I got my full time job, I was buying quality groceries. For reference, I'm an organic, grass fed no/minimal preservatives kinda gal, so shopping at Dollar Tree for me was just....ugh. Nowadays, I still ain't rich but when I do start making significant money, the top of my list is either renting a house or luxury apartment. I hate living in rinky dink apartments.	Honestly, because I was that broke for that long ... the first thing I did was buy a $25 dress from Target, which seemed crazy expensive at the time. I also got Chinese takeout. $30. It tasted like freedom!! I still bring my lunch instead of buying, but now I have end tables instead of milk crates and when I really want expensive fruit at the grocery store, I just buy it.
What were some yellow flags about your boyfriend that turned out not to be a big deal?	My boyfriend is from a very small town in the Midwest, which was a bit foreign to me since I'm from a big city on the West coast. But he and his family are actually very worldly and well educated and I was concerned for nothing.	I'm pursuing a career in academia, and my SO only finished one semester of college before he dropped out. At first, I worried that I wouldn't be able to connect to him on a intellectual level, but turns out he's really smart and is constantly educating himself through reading, watching documentaries, etc. Knowing him has made me much more conscious of the ways we as a society put people in certain boxes, and I'm trying to be better about it. Don't judge a book by its cover!
Which nightmare (or dream) has left you questioning your sanity or life in general?	the one where me and one of my best friends vividly shagged... 3 years after that one, we started dating lol	I’m not a religious person, but I had a nightmare where I could feel the presence of Satan in the most horrifyingly corrupting way imaginable. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night, and it really made me a jittery person for several days afterward. I just felt so violated, even though it was just my own mind.
What's the worst decision your penis has ever made?	Penis: You might be drunk but i assure you the sex with this fat girl that seems to like you will be great. Girl: No you dont need a condom Me: No fuck you get me one she finally found one, i have fucked her for like 30sec and then I didnt want to anymore, she wasent the prettiest und i was very drunk, later I went to the bathroom to beat the meet and finish the job. I am not proud of what I have done, mainly because she was fat and had no ass.	Dick: "Hey, you're in bed with a super hot girl who wants to have sex with you, but nah, not tonight fam."
What do you wish you would’ve asked your roommate before living with them?	Do you do YOGA at 5 am? Gosh I wish I knew he does that before he moved in. College roommate though, had to live with him for 2 months. He was also vegan and constantly nagged about how my meat smelled like an animal corpse. He said he hates meat eaters, because we are destroying the planet. I filled our fridge with pork loin next day, he was pissed. Good times.	"Are you gonna get a job and move to England in the first month, leaving me with double the rent taking care of your stuff which you left here, then cancel my lease which is still under your name, get married without telling anyone, and then die?" Honestly though, I did not even consider asking it.
Have you ever met someone while single, had amazing chemistry only to never see them again? What happened?	Oh man. So, back in February, I went on a date with this woman, and we hit it off immediately. Sparks were flying, the chemistry was palpable, it was AWESOME. Then her grandma died a week later, and I haven't heard from her since. No response to my texts, no answer to my one (1) phone call. No idea what happened. Maybe I fucked something up, maybe she just wasn't ready for things to get real. Who knows?	Yeah. The girl who I kept making eye contact with while shopping today. She was stupid cute and I was too big of a bitch to go say hi. To really answer your question: no.
What has a woman/girl done that you've misinterpreted as being interested in you?	Floormate in college came over to my room almost every day to lay in my bed and cuddle. We never did anything beyond that, and before I could ask her out, she got with another guy.	When they would talk to me. Lmao. I'm in a long term relationship now with my girlfriend (3 years and counting). But PLENTY of times when I was single, especially when I was in college, I had such a lack of meaningful conversations with women that almost every time one of them talked to me with any sort of consistency, I took it as she had interest in me. 9 out of 10 times that wasn't the case.
To women who's life goals consist of all things domestic. How do you handle other women looking down on you for "not making more of yourself" and "perpetuating the female stereotype"?	For me, its not a feminism thing, its a fucking laziness thing. Some people have never held a fucking job in their life, go out and work, go see what thats like and then see how insanely comfortable it is to just stay at home	I ignore them. I've been hearing the same "but you're JUST a housewife" and been told I'm "betraying feminism!" for over 25 years now. Feminism is all about having choices. Some people think that those choices are somehow invalid if they're also traditionally feminine choices. If they want to look down on me, insult, me, and dismiss me because I'm doing what I love, then they've completely lost the plot. I look at it this way: I'm not about to let any *man* dictate my life choices ... so why on Earth would I let a *woman* do it?
Why do we have cultural trends to combat male preferences for slimmer, or hairless women(among others) but the same doesn't happen for the expectations on men?	Because men are not as picky as women. 80% of men, according to women (OKcupid), are below average in appearance. Women are picky with men and have the moral pedestal. Women are perceived as victims by the evil world patriarchy in our society. Hence women don't face the same societal pressure as men when it comes to their appearance. It only becomes worse when feminist types reinforce the shit values that no woman is attracted to. It's really just a downwards, self perpetuating spiral of perceived female victim hood and perceived male guilt.	Because those "cultural trends" are really marketing campaigns. There not being a real industry for beauty products for men, there is no product to be advertised to us to resonate with our need for validation as "beautiful". I'm sure there are campaigns aimed at us that women never get, either.
what is something that a man/men in your life has tried to convince you is a normal thing that all men do/think/believe?	A guy I knew claimed all men go to strip clubs. I really, really hope that one isn't true. Pretty sleazy stuff, that is.	That all men want is sex and that's it. They just want sex. EDIT: because I got a couple of PMs about this. DISCLAIMER: I do not actually believe this is true, as that is NOT the point of the question. I don't believe this, nor was I convinced that this is true. Yes, there are both men and women who look only for sex. I'm not saying ALL men (or women) are like this. Thanks :)
What makes a girl seem unapproachable to you?	Just make sure you either have a lot of money or it's looking like you'll have a lot of money and you'll be set. Women want the benefits of success without working for it.	Why wait around for someone to approach you? People are there to finish school. It's not high school. If you want to meet someone you need to approach them too. Its not a one way street.
If you could go back to when you were 18 would your decision about your education have change, how?	Take useful classes. Business law, accounting, marketing would be more useful than the "fun" Quantum Mechanics classes I took instead.	I'd have learned a trade. It took me years of college and 25k in student debt to realize I'd be miserable behind a desk all day. Now what I do for a living has nothing to do with anything I studied in college and I can't see myself working in another industry.
What do you do EVERY Sunday to help prepare you for the week ahead?	Absolutely nothing and i let my mind wonder to its full extent. Your mind is a sentient being and forcing it to crouch numbers and do other tasks or whatever you do leaves it without its own intellectual needs. I don't need it to remember anything or stress about anything and do what i generally want without outside influences.	Sunday is my relaxation day. I do the chores and other stuff on other days. Sunday I just bake, read a book, watch some fun stuff, maybe use a face mask, don't watch/read the news.
Men that have cheated during a relationship, how did you manage to get over the guilt and actually improve?	I only ever did it when the relationship was going down the drain and 99% knew she was cheating since a long time. No regrets, but in the future i will just break up.	I see everyone talking about physically cheating. Do you guys consider emotional cheating to be a thing, or do you feel it's only cheating if you have sex with another person? Or did I just misunderstand the title and this was strictly about sex?
Men who never dated or had any serious relationship until after highschool how do you think that has exffectrd you?	Definately a positive manner! In the nicest possible way, I think most of the girls in my year were a bit skanky and overly fertile since most of them had offspring in their late teens/ early 20s so I managed to dodge that bombshell. I was utterly useless at sex at first, but one good hookup friend and you soon pick up all of the stuff you probably missed. &#x200B; Ramble over, it's all good, you got this!	I turned out fine. Honestly, skipping dating in the brutal ass hormonal years where you're not thinking straight was probably a *good* thing. No accidental kids for one.
What is something you wasted money on that you're still mad about to this day?	laser hair removal. I was perfect candidate (fair skinned/ almost black hair), but it was from my facial hair from PCOS. They didn’t tell me that it was going to grow back due to its hormonal nature. Hair was gone for a year max before I had to start waxing again. They sure did take my $1k though.	Laser hair removal. I was not a good candidate, my hair is too light for it, but they took my money anyway.
Ladies, have any of you ever made the decision to step down as a bridesmaid / opt out of a wedding party?	Three times so far! Each time I didn't think I should have been asked - one was a girl from high school who is helped out s lot back then but hadn't seen in years, two was my boyfriend's friend's fiancée and she just didn't have many girlfriends, three was my flat mate's fiancé and it was because they were gender biased and he couldn't have a girl on his side. Didn't even go to any of the weddings.	Slight rant... I have a group of friends who is super close; Megan used to be a part of it but has slowly drifted away. Sarah got married last year, didn't ask Megan to be a bridesmaid because we never see her. Megan is super pissed, Sarah apologizes and we do find her a way to be in the wedding (carrying the bride's train). This year, Emily is getting married, and she made sure to ask Megan to be a bridesmaid because we do miss her and she accepts, is super excited. We start having bridesmaid meetings because our outfits and everything were left pretty much up to us, Megan never shows up to any of them. Always has an excuse. Stops even replying, and decides to drop out of the wedding without even talking to Emily. We found out through someone else. What the fuck, Megan??
What are the seven erogenous zones as mentioned by Monica in 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'?	Guy here... in my experience a woman's erogenous zone is.. her whole body. While some parts are more sensitive than others (And there are plenty of good lists so far in this thread) most women love to be touched everywhere. Meaning, let your hand travel from spot to spot in contact, not just jumping. Let her feel the anticipation of your next stop through her skin. My SO goes crazy when my hands are on her stomach and she doesn't know if I'm going to move down... or up.	1. Left eyeball 2. Nasal philtrum 3. Right elbow 4. Right buttcheek 5. Left buttcheek 6. Popliteal fossa 7. Underloaf
Men of reddit: Could you ever love someone with 60+ sexual partners in their past?	Gross. Honestly, no I wouldn't, and I'd be quite disgusted. Not sure if I'd even want to be friends with someone with that kind of history. Sorry, if that's not the answer you wanted to hear OP, but I figured since you asked here you'd much rather have an honest answer than a rosy answer. To be fair though, I'm sure there are many guys that would be okay with it so you do absolutely have a chance at love. Everyone has a chance at love. I'd say you should be honest about your past, cause honesty is the right path, and you shouldn't lie to someone you love.	I personally wouldn't, but obviously we don't share similar views on sex. Doesn't mean I'd hold it against you as a person, just means I most likely wouldn't be relationship-compatible. You just need to find someone who share similar views on sex or someone who is willing to accept your past.
Mixed Race Women, what is an experience that you had due to being mixed race?	Half black/half italian - being a light skin black women, I was either too white to hang out with black people or too black to hang out with white people. People thought I thought I was better than anyone else just because I was light skin but that wasn’t the case. I was raised by my dark skinned mother and I always would wonder why I wasn’t like her. I would become friends with other light skinned black women and we would talk about our issues growing up being light skinned and we had the same experience. Saying we aren’t black, that we’re mixed. We still consider ourselves as black.	I am half Filipino half Polish. Growing up in a 100% white small town in Canada I was endlessly known as the "brown kid" or the Asian girl. Kids picked on me for the food I ate, my mom's accent, how I dressed, etc etc. But when I went back to the Philippines I was the white kid. Understandably so, my mom refused to reach me Tagalog to try to help me "be Canadian". I also was immersed in white culture despite being raised by mostly Filipinos. So I grew up feeling a weird displacement of identity. Not really white, but not really Filipino. Like I couldn't really be fully accepted into either side that I identified with. I still struggle with that feeling.
How do you feel about Cassandra Fortin, the 17-year old who was forced into chemotherapy against her will?	Some people need to be protected from their own stupidity or ignorance, I guess. Once she's eighteen I suppose no one can stop her, but it's sad if she actually wants to live but dies because she believes in ineffective treatment methods.	As her mother seems to be backing her choice, I'm not sure what six months of forced treatment will do for her. It seems both she and her mother are on board with stopping treatment as soon as she hits 18 anyhow. I would guess they will be especially against further treatment after making this six months of treatment extra hellish. Plus strapping people down and forcing medicine into them seems inhumane. I think both she and her mother are likely very wrong about the odds of her survival without medical intervention. I also tend to be of the mindset that at a certain point you give people a rope and decide if they want to pull themselves up with it or hang themselves. If she and her mother want to pick the latter, that's on them.
Who has some jokes?	A woman walks into a bar with her giraffe. After drinking heavily, the giraffe passes out. As the woman stands up the bartender shouts, *"You can't just leave that giraffe lying there like that!"* To which she replies, "It's not a **lion**, it's a **giraffe**!"	A woman walked into a bar. "What'll it be?" Asked the barkeep. "I'll have a double entendre." She said. So he gave it to her.
Does your partner use a condom as an addition to your own birth control product?	We both hate the feel of condoms, so we rely on the withdrawal method which has worked great for almost six years now. My man has super control so I'm not worried about an accidental pregnancy.	Yes, because even with the pill we are afraid we will be one of the unlucky who slip through the cracks and gets pregnant. We have had sex without the condom a handful of times though.
What's the worst/most awkward way someone has tried to seduce you?	While we were already in bed - "would it be ok if I touched your boobs? Or will it make you uncomfortable?" Mate... what the hell did you think we were going to be doing in bed together, post night-out, having spent the past few weeks flirting on nights out & the entire night stuck to each other? Made me feel so awkward and completely put me off	I was waiting for a bus at a stop near a defunct Hooters restaurant, and a guy walked up to me and said “do you work here? ...you could!” Ugh.
What was a small habit you adopted that made the biggest difference in your appearance and well-being?	Working out. Especially running! It lifts your booty and flattens your tummy and fixes your posture so your boobies look perkier lolz.	Not so much one habit, but many habits that I slowly dropped over time. It started with cutting out soda and candy, and over the course of about two years turned into what I can honestly say is an almost completely healthy diet. I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off effortlessly for 14 years. I think making small changes on my own time instead of changing everything at once was my key to success. I gave myself time to focus and adjust to each small change, so I was never overwhelmed or felt deprived.
Girls, women, ladies; what does sexual attraction feel like?	Find it difficult to answer that one as I have a pretty low sex drive myself. Top commenter did it well. But I have a question - as an asexual person, what's the deal? Do you just, like, not have sex?	It's a *want* to touch and to feel them. You're semi-listening to the conversation around you, but you're mind is focused on staring at them and wanting to get close. Intrusive sexual thoughts mingle with the rational part of you. It's both annoying and exciting.
How much did the amount of attention you get change after you got breast implants or butt implants? Positives/negatives?	Not to knock women who get implants, but I love my natural B/C cups. I thought about going bigger because they really don't look like much, especially braless. But I've heard and read a lot that big breasted women don't get taken as seriously which can make it difficult in the professional world. Since that is where I'm heading, I chose my career over boobs. Maybe kids will increase them a bit, maybe not. But either way, I plan on keeping things natural for as long as possible with maybe a lift in the distant future. Edit: breastfed to breasted.	Ten years ago, I went from an A/B cup to a DD/E cup [I asked the doc for a C cup]. I LOVE them. I got quite a lot more attention, 99.5% positive, after I got them. The only negatives for me are so minor that they're really nothing, especially compared to the benefits.
Current/Former brides who lost/had to remove a bridesmaid, what happened?	We had an insanely bad falling out. I never told her she was no longer in the wedding party but left her to assume. There wasn't a date or really anything but a ring at that point. She figured it out. I'm not proud of it, it feels like a low integrity move to just ghost her. I just had no more left to give an energy vampire.	We lost our maid of honour due to a death in her family. Her cousin, which she was very close to, lost her battle with cancer the same week as our wedding. I’ll never forget when she drove over the day it happened. She got out of the truck, barely got two words out and just started bawling. She understandably went to the funeral, but she came to the reception afterwards. We were just happy that she had somewhere fun to go to after that and hopefully lift her spirits a bit.
Are there women out there who truly believe that victims of rape should be denied the ability to have an abortion? If so, why?	1) religion 2) caring more about your tax rate then the rights of your fellow man edit- try as you may, but downvoting me isn't going to make Romney win Ohio. FACED!	A life is a life even if it is spawned from a terrible deed it should not be punished for that. /end The type of person op is looking for. That view is rarely seen on reddit so I thought I would help you out. =p *fixed a word.
Men of reddit, how was YOUR college experience?	I have had the unfortunate experience of going to 3 different colleges throughout the years. And while I have had those typical college experiences (partying, clubbing, sex, adventures, ect.) overall I have had more boring days than exciting days. Not everyone is guaranteed to have a good time in college, you get what you put into it, and every college is different. But my more exciting times in college were in my freshmen and sophomore year where I had more free time.	I went to school in the middle of a big city, so the dating life was *highly* competitive. Most men did not get laid. That said, yes, I made some of the best friends of my life, learned some incredible stuff in and out of the class, partied, did drugs, prepared for my future, and all of the above. What year are you? I know I had a bit of an adjustment period during my freshman year. Just leave yourself open to new experiences, and don't be afraid to say yes. Good things will come to you.
Ladies,how has your SO comforted you in a time of need?	He will do my dishes (we don't live together) or cook a meal if he senses I'm stressed. One night, his parents both made some rude comments while I was over, and he took me out for pizza and beer just to get out and be away from a situation that was making me uncomfortable. Honestly, just time together, rubbing my back or my hair, is very soothing to me.	I really appreciate: 1. My husband taking care of practical things so I have less to worry about. 2. Little gifts like a nice notepad or a magazine. 3. Asking if I want a hug. What *doesn't* help: 1. Useless platitudes like "everything happens for a reason". 2. Being told that there's always someone worse off than you. I am not that someone else, I am me and this is my stuff and if it's hurting then it's hurting. 3. Trying to give me solutions if I don't want them.
Guys, how do you deal with the feeling that you're constantly "behind" in life?	I don't feel left behind because I own every decision I've made up until this point, even when life throws me curve balls. It's the saying, "hindsight being 20/20." You know you could have done better but with the information that you had, you made the choice that you thought was best and you can't blame yourself for that. I was really depressed about this a year or two ago but I decided there's no use crying over spilled milk, shit happens, and you pick yourself up knowing you're only going to stumble again. It's a matter of mindset.	1. Social media is an emotional cancer. Dump it as much as possible as soon as possible. 2. Stop focusing on what you don't have and start focusing on what you do have.
Other than the penis magic we can cast, what are some hidden things women don't know about us?	If a woman's attractive, every one of her facebook photos has been fapped to. Yes... including that one with your nana. Your eyes caught the light right and there was a comely indent in your blouse beneath the left squeezable.	Male privilege checks actually come once a week, not once a month, so it's actually four times what you might think.
Are you ok with being naked in a sauna?	For me it's more of a sanitation issue as opposed to body image/self-consciousness/privacy. I'd be worried about catching something someone else's naked booty left behind. I've also been to onsens so maybe that's why it's not a huge deal to me.	I lived in Russia and, after a bit of initial discomfort, didn't have an issue being naked in the saunas. Culturally, it's much less of a big deal though, and it (from what I experienced) was split between genders.
What was the biggest hit to your self esteem you ever took?	rejected by an ugly nerd in public. Later on in the year saw her dating a dude that was taller and fitter than me. Infuriated me to no end and from that day on I realized that everyone would be happier if they were forced with their looksmatch.	When I was in highschool many of the girls dated guys that were in their 20s. I had a huge crush on this girl and we were both 16. Eventually I found out her boyfriend was 22 and I felt like I wasn't shit. How the hell was I supposed to compete with a 22 year old that has his own car and apartment??!?
What would you respond to men who make comments such as "cover up" and "have more self respect"?	No man has ever said anything like that to me. If I dressed in a way that made them notice they'd just try to fuck me.	Most of the time, ignoring them doesn't work as they take that to mean you've been shamed into silence. This is when channeling Samuel Jackson works best. "I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing."
Ladies, what is your favorite way to feel sexy, either for yourself or for a SO?	Getting the puh waxed shaving my legs and soaking with a lush bath bomb makes me feel pretty great. Wifey likes to nuzzle my legs. If boyfriend #2 is in town I'll get a fancy pedicure for him. He likes feet and I like getting my toes done so it's a good excuse Edit: why is this getting downvoted?? Wife is aware of the boyfriends and she is also with them if there's a concern of cheating.	For myself: Do laundry, shower and shave, do some mild pampering, then roll around naked in clean sheets. For my SO: Thin pajama pants. I don't know why, but he loves them and I find them super comfortable. Everyone wins!
Men who simply don't enjoy watching sports, why? Ever feel like you're missing out?	Because I have absolutely no investment in any kind of sports game. I have no reason to care that some team that happens to be based near me won a game against some team that lives farther away. I don't enjoy playing sports, so I don't get anything out of seeing the games played well. Etc. Etc. Realistically, it's the people who like sports who have something to explain.	I'm one of those guys. I see sports as a bunch of guys who I don't know playing a game that doesn't affect me. I really have no reason to get emotionally invested. I imagine you'd get the same feeling about watching something like a South Korean high school ping pong tournament. The actual experience of watching sports doesn't appeal to me, but the one thing I do feel like I'm missing out on is the ability to walk up to any guy in my city, make a comment about one of the local teams, and have an instant connection.
Do you have an ex you would go back to in a second if they asked you to?	I have an ex or two I'd bang again if they asked me to. And a couple that gained *way* too much weight where I'd laugh at the offer. But date? Nope. It's a breakup because it's broken.	In a second? Probably not. But one of my longest lasting relationships only ended because of distance. If that distance was resolved, I think I would happily date her again. Would she? Who knows? She's engaged to be married so it's moot.
Have you ever met someone who had little to no self-awareness?	I know someone who thinks they're better than everyone else because they don't drink or smoke...but they have never done anything with their life, nor even graduated high school. This person is ignorant child who acts like their due their respect, but doesn't respect anyone else.	I work with someone who not only *can not* shut up but is completely unaware of how much time passes while she is yammering away. She really thinks that time just stops and never understands why she can't finish things during her shift because, in her head, she was always busy. To be fair, she is part time and spends most of the day at home with a three-year-old so I can kind of understand the dam burst that happens when she is around adults again. I'm just tired of cleaning up after her.
What was the most unusual way you have gotten hit in the balls?	I kicked a soccer ball. And I was kicking it to my left so I was kinda doing a swinging kick motion. So my balls were victims of centripetal force and hit against my leg. It hurt	An ex said "think fast" and tossed a football. She was a terrible thrower so I was like "huhwhaaAAAAAUUUGGGHH" and cried for 20 minutes. She ended up kissing it better though so it was all good.
Runners of reddit, how do you not get bored whilst out for a run?	If you’re getting bored while running then I don’t think you’re going hard enough. Pain isn’t boring. Either that or maybe you’re ADD? I don’t think I’ve ever been bored while on a run or even a walk. It’s quite peaceful and relaxing. Love me some walkies. 🐶	I actually like to just zone out and go....even with music on, I'm not thinking about anything. Have you tried group runs?
Women who love their job, what do you do and why do you love it?	I am a housewife. I love it for the following reasons: 1. Setting my own schedule/routine. 2. Don't have to deal with other people 3. I'm old fashioned and believe it should be someone's job to care for the home. If nothing else you want it to be a place you're proud of. 4. More time with my husband 5. He can come home and rest instead of having to cook/clean/do laundry. 6. I have time to meal plan. Sometimes we don't do that, but it's nice having the luxury. 7. We will have children in a few years. I will get to be around them 100% and not miss anything. There are other reasons I love it. I could write a book, but I don't want to, lol.	I work for a handbag designer as assistant designer! I love my boss who has been like a mentor to me after graduation. Its a small company so I get to help out with everything from design to social media to inventory. Its a lot of low risk problem solving that I love!
How can I sexually attract men without making things awkward?	1. be attractive, don't be unattractive, 2. take initiative, aka, talk to someone you like and bring out some moves, 'let's go out for a drink' works, 3. like a guy? smile at him and make eye-contact. wait for him to approach and start convo, rinse and repeat.... \*1: Sorry to say this, but losing weight (if required) and dressing up in a feminine, well-fitting clothes manner goes here. (and this isn't 100% sexist. same applies to no-luck guys too: lose weight, gym and dress better is step 1 advice to guys too...)	You may look innocent or give off that vibe, which is really not a bad thing. The average guy who finds out that you look sweet but like to get freaky, he's gonna be ecstatic. If you do give off that vibe though, guys are gonna feel awkward about trying to sexualize you, at least in public. You may have to simply become more brash, when you find a guy you like then chase him and take what you want.
Women who have had an unplanned pregnancy through casual sex (Fwb, one night stand, etc.), did you tell him? And how did he react?	My friend had an unplanned pregnancy, though she was in a relationship. Her boyfriend reacted by immediately saying she'd ruin his life if she kept it and bought her a giant tub of weird pills and told her to take 8 a day so that she could have a miscarriage. She terminated the pregnancy (the right way, not through weird pills her shithead boyfriend got off of the internet. they weren't even pills intended to end pregnancy).	Yes I told him. He reacted by asking me if I was going to have an abortion. I refused. I moved out of state about a month later. He called me every week during my pregnancy to check on me and the baby. After our son was born, he came to visit and I realized I had some strong feelings for him. We moved in together 4 months later and we’ve been married 14 years this year.
"What female character tropes/types bother you in fiction?" is a common topic. But which ones do you really like?	Obnoxious super moms that are disrespectful to men and don't believe that they're capable of simple child-rearing or house-keeping tasks. The ones that treat their husbands like children and disrespectfully talk to them like they're idiots. It makes women look horrible and its pretty pervasive.	I love when female characters are smart and perceiving - like Skylar in Good Will Hunting. She is caring, but not overly sensitive. And she is smart, but not judgemental. I often think female characters are either completely controlled by emotions, or completely emotionless.
Will conditioner work as a substitute for shaving cream in a pinch? If not, what will?	I use a good soap. I buy handcrafted soaps that have a lot of good oils in them. I can't even remember the last time I bought shaving cream.	Yes! I use conditioner on my legs every time I shave them. Works great and leaves them silky soft. Saves a lot of money, too. Feel free to buy the cheapest conditioner you can find and you’ll only need about a dime size amount for each leg. I use shampoo on my underarms, though, because it does a great job of removing deodorant residue so it won’t clog your razor.
What's it like Going to a Bar Alone to Socialize?	I'm considered to be a decent woman. And I would not go to a bar. Especially with pandemic I don't even go to restaurants. I am using app like MeetMe to socialize.	What you want to do is go to bars in the afternoon, while it's still quiet. If you're lucky you will get to know a savvy bartender. If you become a regular then that bartender could turn out to be your first friend in town. They can tell you about the town, introduce you to other patrons and you will always be welcomed there. Pick cheap drinks but tip above average. Bartenders would rather you give them the money than put it in the register.
Childless, unmarried, 30+ ladies, how is your life?	Later this month I'll be 33. I'm also getting married for the first time just before my birthday. No kids, I hate my life except for SO. He's the only good thing to happen to me since I stopped believing in Santa Clause. Fuck Obama, fuck liberals, fuck the GOP. But don't go by me, I've been especially unlucky.	I'm about to turn 39, single and no kids. I'm super lonely and regret how things turned out. I'm trying to think of how to adapt and make the best of it.
What are some red flags in men that you would warn women about if they asked?	Nevermind. I'm wrong. Date any man that wants to date you and never worry about what they want out of the relationship.	If he always says the right thing at the right time, is so charming and plays all his cards right, but you never saw his friends or where he lives, it's not his first Tango and not his last.
If you married your first crush how would your life have turned out?	Not good. Was a theatre girl, came from a wealthy family (new BMW when she turned 16)...went to a Disney theme park/cruise or other related Disney trip *at least* twice a year... * Despite graduating high school a virgin, went off to college, joined a sorority and slept with half of the Lacrosse team * Dyes her hair like every other month * Became an uber feminist/tumblrina, not necessarily politically, but in the cliche consumerist sense. * Still a rich daddy's girl But still really attractive :(	Well she ended up studying the same thing as me. Seems we still share common interests etc plus she turned out really beautiful. Personality wise who knows, but it may have gone well. But I'm happy it didn't, I have an amazing girlfriend now
How much of a turn off is a woman you are interested in dating being unemployed?	You are just being a teensy bit insecure so here comes some reassurance. No woman ever is turned off for being unemployed. Ever. The reason is men don't find biologically turning on that their offspring will be fed and taken care of. This is why it's absolutely ok for a woman to jump into someone else's life, and frown upon if he doesn't work and she does.	Depends on what unemployed means. Hasn't had a job in four years and isn't currently looking, surviving off the goodwill of others or government/etc. then that's a turn off and a red flag. Currently unemployed but taking significant steps to change that, and doing their best to survive on their own; potentially a green flag, and not a red flag as such.
Women who often have people over, what tips do you have to make your place more inviting?	Let me bring my dog. Seriously. I'm more likely to come over, stay for awhile and get drunk if I can bring my dog. I don't want to leave her at home so if I can't bring my dog odds are I leave early.	I guess you are the most important factor. If you are inviting and a relaxed host, who allows your guests to feel comfortable/at home, they will feel comfortable/at home. Just let them be. and having comfortable seating and a normal hygenic apt is key.
Childcare workers of AW, what's the most inappropriate thing a kid has ever said to you?	I was watching my sibling and the neighbor kid when lil bro said "If {niece} doesn't learn to share I'm going to punch her in the vagina" He was ~5. I wasn't even mad, could just laugh. When asked where he heard that he said "mom."	Last year a fourth grader told me he was going to sneak into my room, kill my parents, and get me pregnant.
Aloof men of reddit, how do you pull it off when it comes to attracting women,dating, relationships, or whatever you call it?	Start with tic tacs. Move in for the kiss. Tongue down the throat. Grab the downstairs business. Deny it when anyone asks. :)	Why would you want to date someone if you aren't interested in what they have to say? Small talk doesn't have to be about the weather, it's just a way of broadly getting to know someone until you hit upon something you connect on and can talk more deeply about.
Gents, what made you walk out on a date?	She over used the words baby-daddy, queen, king, princess and deserve. It's a little cold, but I stood up and dropped $40 on the table. I the looked her in the eye and said. This is for the food I ordered, not for you. I'm sure you are used to men you barley know leaving money for you on the table or your dresser before they leave.	One time a "date" took me to a pyramid scheme meeting. I was so amused I stuck around for a while and only walked out when they tried to get me to sign up. I should of walked out sooner lol! But the dates that I ended quickly have been things like treating waitstaff poorly and keeping the conversation about themselves. I can't stand people who brag and talk themselves up endlessly.
AskMen there's a thread on AskWomen about creepy guys and I know women encounter them on a regular basis but how about creepy women? Do you have a good story about them that you could share with us?	Yeah, they are easy enough to avoid though. If their hair is not a regular human color, and they can't hold a conversation about anyone but themselves... Not worth the time.	When I was in college a friend of mine had this one girl who would not leave him alone despite his making it crystal clear that he was in a long term relationship. On three different occasions he came back to his room to find her in his bed waiting for him. Each time he reported it and each time she was "talked to" by the RA's or the dean of students but nothing more. She suddenly stopped bothering him and a week or so later one of his suitemates found her in HIS bed waiting for him. After that incident she left school, we think the school contacted her parents but we don't know for sure. edit: this was the 80's so things like this weren't taken as seriously as they probably would be now
How can I make my girlfriend feel attractive?	You can't. She has to decide that for herself. You might be able to demonstrate that you do find her attractive, but you can't *make someone* believe anything, AFAIK. Just like you can't force a junkie to quit drugs just by putting them in a rehab program: they have to *want it* in order for change to happen.	Maybe try complimenting her outside the bedroom as well. For example, my boyfriend will always grab my ass or boobs (at appropriate times) or when I'm getting dressed he just watches me and will say things like "I fucking love your ass" or "you have the most amazing body" or "you're so fucking hot". It always makes me feel wanted and attractive.
What scene from your life, whether wonderful and beautiful or utterly painful, do you often replay in your head?	This was a fairly recent moment, about a little more than two weeks ago. I had just met up with a girl I met back in August. After having In and Out and a lengthy conversation, with an intense make out session, I drove her back to the place she was staying at. While I was driving and she was in the back seat stroking my hair and holding my hand, the song from The Weeknd and Daft Punk 'I Feel it Comin' was playing. The MJ vibe and the lyrics to the song spoke to us, and to the intimate moment we had. Just gotta wait at least a few more weeks to see where things go for us.	My fiance coming inside from having a smoke. She stated she was dizzy and the fell to the ground seizing. She went brain dead and died a week later. The experience wakes me up most nights.
I noticed that some men think a woman can go from a 10 to a 3 because of her personality. In what situations can a 3 get to a 10 because of her personality?	Doesn't matter. 1) Most guys are 4s. 2) Most women who make an effort, even if they're fat can be someone's 7,8, or 9. Your number changes more based on who's looking at you vs your attitude 3) most guys aren't confident to enough to talk to a universal 8,9,10.... the type of women on magazine covers. 7 range will always get approached more	I can throw a 100lb weight off of a building. I can't throw it back on top from the ground. Some things only work in one direction.
In what ways are you a massive fucking hypocrite?	My husband is totally cool with/encourages me to see other people. I would most likely be a mess if he wanted to go on a date with someone else. I'm not that bad with my other partners but damnit my husband is MINE. I turn into jealous trash when it comes to him.	I always think other people should confront their difficult issues with friends/family/partner head on, but *I* never fucking do. Your friend is treating you like crap? Just tell her, you don't have to put up with that shit. Am I going to do that if it happens to me? Hell no. I will fume in silence and hope she just works out what she did wrong. Edit: fucking hell this blew up while I was asleep. Glad I'm not the only assertiveness hypocrite out there.
Non-Americans of AskMen: What major sporting event in your country are you pretty sure the rest of the world doesn't know about and why should we?	Not nearly everyone does it. I hadn't even known March Madness had started and I have a fairly large friend group none of whom are participating. It is quite popular but hardly as universal as you represent.	Indian here....we have a sport called Kabbadi. It is approx 2000 years old in our country. It is a lot like Olympic wrestling, instead there are 2 teams of 7 people that go against each other.
When it comes to dating/relationships, what was your "I just hit a one-in-a-million jackpot" moment?	When I was looking at porn this morning with a blonde and a redhead getting DP'd, and I realized that the feeling I was experiencing was nostalgia because she's in Florida for a week. We did that just a couple of weeks ago, and now the thing that was one of my fantasies is a happy memory of how hot my SO is. Makes me happy that I'm dating a smart, loving, beautiful, wildly sexy woman.	Made a profile on OKCupid. Messaged 1 girl, nothing. 2nd girl I messaged ended up becoming my wife. She was about to delete her profile and saw my message.

Do men enjoy "only" kissing/making out without the promise of sex/intimacy by the end?	Blue balls... personally I am convinced that this phenomenon was coined by some twig of a greaser thirty years ago whose girlfriend was not ready for sex yet. It depends on the situation, does it not? It is not a very good policy to 'expect' anything from another person, but I do not think it would be an unreasonable assumption that sex would follow a heavy make-out session with someone you were already intimately aware of. It would be pretty brutish to expect sex be the end result of every touch, kiss, tickle, or prod however. Blue balls is such a joke to me, though. The only 'pain' I have ever felt from being denied sex was emotional pain, not physical.	To an extent, but it gets old. A few minutes is fine if we're alone together, but if there's no progression I get bored. If we're at a bar or out on the town, I'm fine with a little make out session, but again, I'm going to be thinking about progressing to sex later.
Why is it that two people can be best friends platonically, but bring out the worst in each other in a relationship?	A romantic monogamous relationship has a very clear set of rules whereas a friendship has not. A friendship can adapt to clashing personalities, but for a monogamous romantic relationship to happen, both people have to be compatible in a very narrow, definitive way and the room for maneuver is quite narrow. ~~kinda the whole reason why I'm non-monogamous and much prefer friendships~~	Because we need different things from a friend than we need from a romantic partner. For example, I would prefer to have more interests in common with a friend than a partner, and need my partner to have the same values as me, whereas congruent values is less important for me with a friend. Furthermore, maybe someone loves the party animal friend who always has a joke and great stories. But there are many people who would struggle to be romantically involved with the party animal.
Women who are married/with a SO who's culture and lifestyle are completely different than yours, what were your thoughts and how did you deal with it?	I'm American and my husband is Mexican. I was really open to his culture from the beginning. I've learned to cook a lot of mexican dishes and have been learning Spanish. It's been a lot of fun getting involved in his holidays, music, dancing, and pop culture. There are some things we don't quite see eye to eye on, but we've always been respectful of each other's differences in opinions.	SO is Korean, I'm British. There is definitely some culture clash, he spent most of his life there and is very proud of being Korean. He'll sometimes say something sexist, or slightly racist, and I would call him out on it. It caused a lot tension at the start of the relationship: we would erupt into arguments constantly. It's much better now though, after almost 3 years, either he's changed, or he doesn't bring it up anymore. On the positive side, he introduced me to Korean food! We have cupboards full of Korean ingredients now, I make it for myself even when he's not around.
Why is there such a strong negative vibe against moms on reddit?	I thought it was simply due to the fact our generation is filled with people who do not want children. The type who have decided to not have children lean intellectual, and cerebral people flock to reddit for long form communication. Facebook and Twitter and what not are used very differently with the intent to share. Reddit is more internal. Thoughts alone. **edit** *Bless your hearts. I can't repeat myself anymore. "More people, more saturated views, more content on a website where cerebral people in general flock to share their unfiltered views." That is all. There's not even a viewpoint here and ya'll are losing your minds. Yeesh.*	I think part of the problem that hasn't been mentioned is that a lot of people hate child support and see it as 'women getting money from hard working men.' I encourage anyone outraged by paying child support to get a good lawyer, clean up their life (if necessary) and seek full custody. The answer to that is always 'The courts are biased against men, why even try?' If the mothers are with their children's father and not working full time, they are again viewed as leeches on men, as though raising children isn't hard work and high quality childcare isn't outrageously expensive. Reddit has twisted the narrative so that mothers have all the power and fathers have none. It's the anger of men who want to have sex and father children without personal consequences/responsibility.
Married/engaged ladies, after how much time spent in the relationship was it clear to you that this is the person you want to marry?	1 year. Everytime we thought we were done we worked it out and came out 10x stronger after. I looked back on that year and saw how much we'd both grown and knew this was something special. Were coming up on our six month anniversary in a few days.	Sounds crazy, but I knew I was going to marry him after our first conversation. No specific reason, just had a gut feeling. I remember going home and telling my mom that there was a nice new guy at work and she said “boyfriend material?” And I told her “I’m gonna marry this guy”. Seven months later, he popped the question and we celebrated our ten year wedding anniversary in April Edit: major typo 😅
How do you feel about "word art" decorations? I.e., "live, laugh, love" decals, "always kiss me goodnight" signs, and "in this house, we do X, Y, Z" posters?	It's ugly and obnoxious. My feelings towards them are a mix of hatred and amusement. My extended family all decorates their homes with these things. The have "live, laugh, love" decals, pinteresty hand painted signs with bible quotes, patriotic quotes and sayings that romanticise the first half of the 20th century all over the place. They can decorate however they want, it's not my home. Whenever I'm given things like that, it usually ends up at Goodwill or I sand off the quotes if it's on something I'd use. And I know it isn't kind, but sometimes I'll snap pictures of these things and send it to friends who love cringy shit.	Not for me. Kind of tacky. But you do you. I'm sure people think my framed movie posters and comic book decorations are childish. I do not care.
Girls who've done boob jobs, are you satisfied with the result?	I work in porn so I see a lot of fake boobs and honestly, the majority look fake or unnatural, not just size but shape too. The ones that "went through the nipple" look the most fake. But I haven't really met anyone who is unhappy with them... Some girls have said they have no sensation left, while others say the exact opposite.	My good friend had them done years ago and said they're the best thing she's ever done. They look fabulous! She even has a birthday for them every year and we go out and get drunk in celebration of her amazing boobs.
Women, do you prefer a man to directly ask for consent for small romantic gestures (ie. "Would you like to hold hands?" "Could I put my arm around you"), or is it too awkward? What's the best way to approach doing these gestures, especially for the first few times in a relationship?	Please feel free to respond based on the genders that you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who date men.	Please feel free to respond based on the genders that you find attractive. This question is not limited to women who date men.
What is something that you thought was completely normal until you grew up to find that it isn't so normal?	(I'm a guy, but I think this still applies) My mom (pretty much the only woman in my life for a long time) has borderline personality disorder. If you have lived with someone, especially a parent, you know how bad that is. It has *fucked* with my perception of women for a long time, and I am just now getting over it.	I grew up in an old farmhouse that had an addition put on in the 70s, 20 years before we moved into it. I didn't realize that usually when people add new rooms, they also add new fixtures and remove obsolete ones, redo drywall, etc and so most homes do not have front doors that actually lead to closets or windows that lead to other rooms instead of outside. It's a fun quirk. I love that house.
How does the feeling of sex with condoms compare to sex without condoms for you?	Guy here, I'm not a fan of condoms. I rather not have sex than have sex with condoms. Gf is not on bc so condoms are our only option. I've been kind of avoiding having piv as much as possible because I hate it. I try to kinda steer things towards hands and oral stuff only.	It absorbs all my natural lubrication so it gets rough reaaaal quick for me. Not a fan of condoms at all.
Caught my girlfriend going through my PC and phone, how to handle this?	You're chicks crazy man! She doesn't trust you for shit and is trying to dig up shit by invading your privacy and not asking. Throw the hoe out!	It really depends on how you feel about this girl, which you haven't told us. If you think there could be a future with her, you need to talk to her about trust and boundaries. If you're just having fun, break up with her. The whole point of a casual relationship is so you don't have to deal with stuff like this.
What makes a woman boring to you?	Lack of passion. About anything. A hobby, a pet, a dead president, I don't care what you care about, but care about something! I've legitimately had women look at me like I asked a trick question upon hearing me say, "So tell me something interesting about yourself."	Inability to flirt back or make jokes back. I give it a while to see if they open up, but if they never do, it's a bad sign. If we're together for a long time, there will be times the only things we can say to each other are jokes or flirty things. They need to be able to play off me or let me play off them. Otherwise it's just not fun.
Which brands do you think are expensive because of they actually are better quality and which do you believe people just pay for the the name?	Fender, Gibson, fuck, honestly. Any guitar company that can charge over 5000 dollars for a guitar, really. If it's an acoustic, eh. If it's an electric...no electric guitar needs to cost over 2000$ for it to be top of the line.	Most generic medicines are made by the same companies who produce the name brand stuff. You can buy generic Tylenol made by the makers of Tylenol for a fraction of the price.
How do you feel about serial monogamists as opposed to people who have casual flings/sex?	> So, you'll often hear about a very high partner count being a turn-off You do often hear this, but not everyone feels this way. I think all this stuff you're talking about depends entirely on who is involved. Generally speaking, unless you're consistently making a string of terrible decisions, I won't judge your past. (none of the situations you describe sound that way) People get hung up on all kinds of stuff, and it's more the people than the stuff, if you know what I mean. I feel like if someone has a problem with serial monogamy, it says more about their past than yours. Everyone's life is complicated, and to make judgements without understanding the whole picture is foolish.	It's not so much the never-being-single and jumping-from-one-relationship-to-the-next. The thing about those kind of women that bothers me is they're able to do so because they surround themselves with male orbiters. In her circle of friends, maybe two thirds of her male friends want to date/fuck her. They're constantly flirty with her, and she expects her current boyfriend to just accept it because "that's how we've always been". It's a carefully cultivated climate of constant validation from always feeling desired. There's got to be some neuroses in that somewhere.
Have you ever been in a group situation where something you thought was normal gets questioned by everyone and you question everything you thought you knew?	I remember playing Mortal Kombat on a friend's Xbox when I was around 14/15. He had another friend over at the time who I hadn't met before. Anyway, there's this fatality move that Scorpion does where he uses his chains to grab the game's camera and pull it towards himself. I thought that was an amazing effect at the time and commented on how I liked the way they used the game camera like that. The other guy looks at me as though I've said the strangest thing ever and chuckles to himself while saying "haha, he calls it a camera." My friend and I just looked at him, and then we looked at each other and said "that's what we've always called it."	I was helping to make cookies from scratch with a gf once. When she started placing scoops on the baking tray I stopped her and said "What about the milk?" She just stared at me... "When I was young my mom always made cookies and milk was always an ingredient...." More staring.... Then she gingerly responds: "Babe, those cookies came from a box. The only time one adds milk to cookie mix is when the cookies are powdered....in a box. You've told me your mom was a terrible cook. Did you think she was a better baker?" My world was shattered.
Previous owners of lusciously long hair: what has been the reaction to your *very* short haircuts?	When I was dating my ex, I had a short bob. He saw some old pictures of me with waist-long hair and hinted that he'd like me to grow it out... and I hinted that he could go fuck himself. A few days later his mom said "I was surprised when we met, because my son usually prefers girls with long hair". I replied "well, he can go date one of them, then" and that was the end of it.	I went from long, luxurious curls to a 1/4" buzz cut. Women were generally surprised, but liked it. Men were overwhelmingly *angry*. "Are you a lesbian now?" "*Someone's* got issues." "Your boyfriend let you do that?" "What, are you some kind of angry feminist or something?" One asshole grabbed my arm and checked for track marks. My SO is the one who made sure my shaves were even all over, and I kept the same job I've had forever, so no impact there aside from the drug test.

Men, are you able to maintain a completely platonic friendship with a woman?	I'm married and I don't have close female friends. Doesn't work. Women seem to be capable of platonic relationships, men not so much...	Basically all straight men have some proportion of their female friends that they would like to have sex with on some level if it were a possibility and a proportion of the lion's share of the remainder that they wouldn't turn down if the woman offered and they could have sex with a reasonable expectation of no negative consequences. >Can you have completely non sexual, platonic friendships with women? At some point I have had some level of sexual thought about or response to every attractive woman I have been friends with going back to about the age of 13 or 14 and many of the average ones. I have actually made a move on or had sex with a much, much smaller fraction of them.
Men who are confronted with potential threats of violence routinely (security guards, police officers, bouncers, etc), what do's, don'ts and pieces of advice can you give for other men who find themselves facing similar threats?	Reveal peace, prepare for war. here's my go to sayings in confrontation "if you knew what could happen to you, you wouldn't be acting like this" "one of us is going to the hospital and one of us is going to jail, or we can both get home safe" Always put your hands out in a manor that says "im the defender" if anyone is ever recording you you'll always look like the defender	Step 1: Don't escalate. Step 2: If it becomes apparent that you're not going to be able to defuse the confrontation *act first, act fast, and act with authority*.
People who overcame depression, how the fuck did you do it?	Time to process the hurt. It takes a year and a half (IMHO). You can speed this up somewhat with therapy. A pen and paper is a pretty good therapist. Just write down everything, and think about it. Do it once a week. And, excercise.	Worked on myself and my life 1. Avoided negativity : people , movies,books 2. Study depression ; know your red flags ex: sleeping too much,eating poorly etc.. 3. it takes time and even after 4 years I have some depressive times. 4. Talked about it : seen a psychiatrist and took meds if needed
What's your roomate from hell story?	He was a food labeler. He wrote his name on food. For me this has always been a roomie dealbreaker. I know many will think me unreasonable. I think it’s an affront to the idea of communal living (which is what roommates is). You use it, replace it, even better replace it twofold then we are well stocked. And happiness ensues. This is not an office, it’s a home. We’re in it together. I was also his boss and responsible for him having a salary, great contacts, etc. opened up know home to him, a food labeler...	This is so minor compared to everything people are going to say, but it really wore on me all year. She would stay up until 3 am texting with the keyboard sounds on.
As a man in a relationship of over 2 years I've often found that as the guy you're expected to automatically be happy or at the very least completely emotionally stable in any situation, is this common in healthy relationships, and if not what seemed to help ease it?	Its 2019 man. You're allowed to show some emotion and get a bit freaked every now and again, its perfectly normal. You don't need to worry about easing it until it becomes something that is happening every other day. That's when its unhealthy... Also tell your other half to chill out (maybe not directly like that as it'll go down like a lead balloon I'm sure). You do you and you've got your own shit to deal with rn without being tremendously attentive. You're #1 to you, not her. If shes cool she should respect it and chill.	+1 on just telling her. Likewise, if she knows what you’re going through, she needs to respect your time, personal space, and personal priorities.
Men: how do you approach the situation when your SO flirts with other guys when you are out partying?	It doesn’t bother me. She’s hot so she gets hit up if I didn’t want it to happen I’d have courted/married ugly chicks. Yes she flirts back, if she didn’t have game I wouldn’t be with her either.	That's gonna be a big "not cool" from me, chief. I don't even know if I'd bother having a boundary-setting conversation, cos it sounds like she's just going to keep doing it behind your back.
What are the ways your partner helps you feel emotionally safe?	I'm polyamorous, and I make a point of making it *very* clear to my partner's when any relationship starts. My other ex-partners haven't dealt with this well in the past. They originally say they're OK with it, and then they blow up later on (which led to some serious mental health dips)... But my current partner is just so wonderful! He was presented with the reality of a polyamorous partner, and instead of blowing up, he took some time away to consolidate and understand his feelings, and then came back to me. This is the first time a partner has displayed emotional maturity with me. It makes me so insanely safe to talk about my own feelings with him!	Being genuinely interested and compassionate when I share my feelings with him. Validating my emotions when I try to invalidate them myself.
Men who aren't passionate about anything, what type of career did you get into?	So you think your passion, if you have any, should be your rice bowl even if it pays you poorly? Think my career is my rice bowl and not the center of my life.	I have an intellectual passion in Philosophy (Bachelors) and sporting passion in Soccer (Currently coach kids). But battling depression makes a lot of shit I know I am and should be passionate about pretty muted. I have a masters in Accounting and work as a financial and inventory analyst for a medical supply company. I've automated a lot of what I do, so work flies by and I kind of just sit there with headphones on--not playing any music. I just don't want people bugging me. \-Elmo shrug-
When did you really start taking care of your body?	I haven't really. I'm still young, 26, so I'm trying to start some easy-to-maintain habits and slowly build. For now, I cook a week of (vegan) meals every Saturday night and do a yoga routine from YouTube every night.	In my early 20s. I was kind of fat, but my dad's family is full of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. I didn't want to end up like them. Now 20 years later, I'm in decent shape. Never wanted to look like John Cena. I do it for my health, not to be swole for chicks.
what do you look for when visiting a potential romantic interest' home?	As a nerd girl. I want to see nerd stuff, I want to see your PC, I want to see your videogame collection, your media, comics, anything. I don't want to see this lifeless shell of a house. If it doesn't smell like a convention at the end of the weekend, I'm chill. I have no objections to posters without frames, wallscrolls, naked anime chicks, nothing like that. Because quite frankly, if I'm being invited to their house, I'm already interested in them.	On my first date with my husband, when we curled up in his bed, the sheets smelled like they were freshly laundered. It's a small thing, but it made it that much better.
Women who have decided not to have children, what made you decide that?	Okay, so here's the thing: I want my children to exist, because I feel like I have good genes to pass on. I'd like to be an egg donor or something. That said, I don't actually want to have and raise kids. I don't really like kids, (some are pretty okay, though), and I get rather annoyed when I'm going on vacation or whatever, and have to figure out someone to take care of my cats. I just think I'd find it terrible having to plan around another human before I could even go out for a cup of coffee. I'm not saying I'll never have kids, because maybe one day I'll settle down, and feel like that would be an okay compromise. I am, however, saying that it hasn't happened yet, and I'm already in my 30s.	Realizing I didn't have to have kids is what caused me to decide I wasn't having any. Growing up it seemed like I had to have kids, which I had kind of admitted to myself, "Well this will be a miserable time in my life, but I'll get through it". When I realized having kids was optional, I decided I wasn't going to. How has it impacted my life? I feel much happier, not having pressure from something I don't want to do. How has it impacted my relationships? I only date people who also do not want children.
Is anyone else celebrating NYE alone?	Put on a swell dress, going out to a nice dinner, then drinks and desert at a little speakeasy and cap off the night at my usual bar :)	This thread is making me feel so much better. I just moved across the country and my mom has been guilt tripping me for not having new friends in my new town. Spending NYE alone has been feeling really lonely and embarrassing.
Women who make six figures, what do you do for work? How is your work to life balance?	PM at a mid-size hedge fund. Make well over six figures - I was actually trying to figure out how much I make but because it's so complicated I can't. I work from 7am to about 6pm with a gym break mid day. I usually work half days on Saturday just cleaning things up. I work whenever the markets are open but don't travel constantly like I did when I worked at the bank, so that's nice.	I USED to have a six-figure income (about $115k gross) working as a mine geologist. I would spend two weeks at a remote mine working 12+ hours a day and living in a camp they had set up, followed by two weeks at home. It's a good lifestyle for a young person (lots of free time for vacations and enough money to get myself started financially) but I wanted to switch careers and work closer to home. I'm currently going back to school while working sporadic short-term geology contracts.
Have you ever stayed in a relationship after your partner cheated?	Yes and it is ALWAYS a mistake. Don't ever take back a cheater. Even if they don't cheat again (which they definitely will), you're still always going to have that worry/doubt in the back of your head. People deserve better than to stay with partners who've cheated.	I ended a relationship when my ex-boyfriend cheated, but then got back together with him after a little while. It was absolutely not worth it. He was genuinely remorseful and never cheated again, but he still treated me badly in a lot of other ways, compared me to other girls a lot, and made me believe that his infidelity was my fault. If someone disrespects you in one way, they will disrespect you in others.
Ladies, what has happened recently that made you feel pretty?	I had my lingerie party bridal shower thing this weekend, and got tons of cute, sexy things. Gave my fiance a fashion show when I got home and he just kept saying how lucky he is with a schoolboy smile :)	I had a *really* good hair day on Sunday, and lots of people saw it because of Super Bowl festivities. For a curly girl, that's a big deal!
Women who lost/gained a lot of weight or whose physical appearance drastically changed -- how have people treated you differently, if at all?	I’ll always be a fat girl at heart.. not literally “fat” but the trauma or memories attached to my past with my weight will keep me humble forever. Lost about 20-30 pounds after high school and also lost body fat and turned to muscle in the right areas.. was always invisible to men in the past and Sometimes I even felt like girls wanted me around to make them look prettier. Now I see that the tables have turned, those guys are scrubs and hit me up randomly, and girls seem envious of my new found confidence within myself. It’s revenge at its finest without me doing or saying anything to them. Oh, also I get job offers much easier than before which really upsets me at times with how society works.	A few years ago I lost about 70lbs by choice through diet and lifestyle change. I noticed that strangers are much nicer to me in general now (holding doors for me, offering me their seat on public transport, and positive customer service interactions). I've been catcalled at more which I have still not gotten used to. It makes me very uncomfortable. I put more thought into showing less skin now which was something I never really worried about before.
What do you think of the saying, "Every man is a socialist at 25 and capitalist at 50"?	at 25 you're an idealist, socialism (espacially in the communism way) is an ideal, something that only works in theory. True communism is a pretty cool idea, but we've had enough examples to see that it isn't going to work (ussr, vietnam, china, etc.). So being a capitalist at 50 means, you've aged and matured and realized that while capitalism is flawed, it's a fact of life and you learn to live with it. This is probably some stupid american politics statement so feel free to ignore me	I just looked up the statistics in my country and people above 50 are actually more likely to vote socialist party than 25 year olds.
Women with male roommates, what are they like?	For reference: I'm a 30 year old single woman. I lived with a guy and 2 women for a year and a half. LOVED my male roommate. Totally respectful of common space, quiet (aside from a few drunken nights coming home ... but hey, we're in late 20s), considerate, paid bills on time, picked up toilet paper when we needed it, etc. Aside from cleaning up his beer bottles every so often, I never had to pick up after him. And cleaning bottles was more because I didn't want them on the coffee table. We had a cleaning crew come once a month because no one wanted to do the dirty work of deep cleaning the bathrooms and kitchen. It worked. I live with another guy now and he's equally as great. Cannot stand living with other women.	I live with three guys. We were all friends prior to living together, and we get along well, hang out fairly often and all that. My only issue with them is that they don't fuckin clean anything.
You suddenly find yourself in a magical world where you can eat anything and not gain weight. What do you eat, and how much?	I think I'm already living in that world. Eating too much or anything too greasy gives me stomach ache rather than making me gain weight. I avoid fatty food like the plague.	I would eat so many carbs! Pasta and rice and poatoes all the way! I don't love junk food that much, but I tend to overdo it on portions of normal food.
Dear AskWomen, as someone currently with cramps in a fetal position how do you stay productive during your period?	I take 6 Aleeve every 4 hours, and eat some hot soup to calm my stomach or drink hot chocolate, plus two heating pads. I also do Lamaze breathing. If it's really going to be that bad, I'll just take the day off.	I eat a fuck ton, drink a fuck ton, and try to do as little physical labor as possible. I've found that exercise makes things worse for me personally. So so so much worse.
It seems many young men under 20 show up here to complain that they feel alone and undesirable, askmen- what do you have to say to these young men collectively?	Man the fuck up. **You most certainly know what you should be doing to become more desirable and attractive.** No, playing LoL isn't a part of it. Don't expect to become desirable if what you do all day is go to school, then go home and sit in front of a screen and overeat for hours. Edit: What I'm saying is that it takes effort. If you put in the effort, you'll become more attractive. If you don't, fantasizing about fucking anime characters is all you'll be left with, or you'll have to settle for some embarrassing fatty.	I cannot believe the absolutely negative comments on here. We all went through tough times. We all did. "Piss off life ain't fair", great advice. These guys feel low as fuck and I'll do anything I can to help put them in the right way. I'm sure all of you know about the massive male suicide rate, we all know a guy who killed himself. I do. They felt like how these guys do.
Ladies that attended your 10 year hs reunion what happened to most of your former peers?	I haven't been to mine yet, but I went to my husband's reunion a few years ago. We had lots of fun! Most people were really friendly. My husband had a great time since he was one of the more successful people there with a good looking SO. We may have had less fun if those circumstances were different. But I'm not sure I will go to mine. I don't really want to see those people.	I've only been out of high school for five years, but I feel like Facebook has ruined the surprise of X-year reunions. I *know* what my graduating class has been up to, I *know* who got fat/thin/married/pregnant/etc. Even if I liked any of those people I have nothing to talk about with them because people my age just continually share every minute detail of their lives online.
Have you ever been shocked by how attractive someone is?	Yeah the girl I'm currently dating is ridiculously attractive. I'm surprised that someone like her would want to date someone like me. She's a honest 10/10 while I'm a 5/10 balding, slightly chubby guy. When she sleeps over my house, she often falls asleep with her head on my chest and I can't stop thinking just how beautiful and angelic she is. On top of how great she looks, she's an amazing person. I can't believe how lucky I am. However, the end of this winter will probably be the last time I see her because I'm going to be moving away for work in the summer when I graduate and she goes back to school far away for the spring semester.	I was working at the GAP and we had to say this line over-and-over again. "Hi! Welcome to the GAP. Have you heard about our 40% off sale on blahblah?" One time I was folding sweaters or something and this guy walks past me. I looked up and was so shocked by how HOT he was, I ended up saying something like "Hi!... There's a sale... 40% off. Welcome!" and slinking away.
Those of you who speak 2+ languages, how does your personality change between languages, and do you feel that a particular languages highlights a part of your personality more?	I'm fluent in 3 and this is a silly question. I mostly dream in English and sometimes think in Hebrew. The languages change, the man behind them remain the same.	I can fluently speak French, English and Reunion's island Kreol (more like a dialect but still) When I speak French, I'm more introvert and shy, English : More outgoing and friendlier, and when I speak Kreol, I'm more direct/rude.
The Older I Get, The More My Dad Knows... What Advice Did You Ignore?	im not even gonna read all this.... my dad thinks he has it all figured out and hates me at the moment.... we havent talked in 6 months. I am an artist and he doesnt like it. bottom line is - DO NOT TAKE ADVICE FROM PEOPLE IF YOU DON NOT WANT THEIR LIFE! They only know how to get where they are... most people are bitter bc they didnt chase dreams or do what they wanted... or had kids.... or took a shitty job bc of "good pay and benefits"... 75-80% of people waste their lives and don't realize it til they are about to die! chase happiness - chase the burn inside.... chase passion. Fuck advice. chase feelings!	Awesome post. God damn, I learned just about every lesson the hard way, like my father before me. Haha, that mother fucker tried so hard to teach me the lessons he learned the hard way but I let it go in one ear and out the other. The biggest piece of advice I didn't listen to was when he told me "Don't worry about women. You focus on your goals and when you get older they'll worry about you."
My SO and I are moving houses for the first time. Do you have any tips or tricks to make the moving process easier?	If you can afford it, just hire movers. It saved my partner and I time and energy that would would have spent arguing with each other because we were hot/hungry/tired.	Purge while you pack. If there are things you never use or have been meaning to get rid of, do it now. Don't pack and haul a bunch of junk and clutter around with you. It'll make unpacking go more quickly.
What makes a girl crazy or clingy?	Do not call or text me (unless it's legitimately important): - In the middle of the night - When you know I'm at work - More than thrice daily - When you know I'm otherwise occupied Also, "crazy" or "clingy" is definitely achieved when you insist on contacting me after a break-up or have unreasonable illusions about every woman I speak with.	Best advice I ever took (as a lady): If a guy doesn't seem interested, walk away. People who do not give you their time are not worth yours.
What life changing cosmetic products are you glad you tried?	I hate to admit it (because they're soooooo overpriced and also a stupid MLM!) but my S.I.L. sells Rodan+Fields skin products. She gave me a tube of their lash serum for Christmas and... IT WORKS. I've always had stubby, thin eyelashes. They're not loads thicker, but they're a LOT longer! I've used my tube sporadically since early January (avg. 3x week). And it's still got serum in it. So it lasts a good long while, esp. if you use it every other day. They'll tell you to *USE IT EVERY DAAAAAY YOU HAVE TO!* but it still works if you don't. ...I might have to buy more when this tube's out, despite my better judgment. Edit: typo	Urban decay eyeshadow primer.. I have oily, semi hooded lids and before I used it my eyeshadow would look terrible within an hour.. over the years I’ve gone through several tubes and will continue to repurchase Face moisturizer.. I wasn’t doing it before on a consistent basis before 25 but now I use it everyday and I saw improvement within 2 weeks of daily use. Now it’s been about 3 month and my skin looks so much more beautiful. If you do a little research on your skin type and issues you can find a moisturizer to help your skin improve. Batiste dry shampoo... I have long, straight hair so I get oily pretty quickly but I also hate washing it and bc of its length the drying process can take forever. On day three I can use it and still look good enough to have my hair down.
Ladies how much are you bothered by being told to smile?	This post has been locked due to a ridiculous amount of derailing and invalidation. When people are sharing their experiences, listen and don't be assholes trying to make it about yourself or argue with them about their own lives.

Since April’s sexual assault awareness month, when was a time you had to deal with sexual assault?	things allowed in this thread: meaningful discussion of personal stories, support. things not allowed in this thread: victim blaming, needless slander, using the experiences to further your own shitty agenda. if you see any comments that match the second group, don't forget to mash that report button and please hit the bell to receive notifications when a new shithead gets banned.	things allowed in this thread: meaningful discussion of personal stories, support. things not allowed in this thread: victim blaming, needless slander, using the experiences to further your own shitty agenda. if you see any comments that match the second group, don't forget to mash that report button and please hit the bell to receive notifications when a new shithead gets banned.
What suprised you about women's bodies?	Hste to sound arrogant, how quickly they get wet and orgasm, for me it was harder to get off. The media paints it like all men premature ejaculate and all women are hard to satisfy. I was fucking girls so hard they were passing out from pleasure. I dont even have a big dick. Its adverage. Lick the clit, rub the roof of the pussy on the g spost and alternate that with deep thrusts of your fingers. Providing to have a slowly increasing rythm they will cum. Easy as that. I was amazed at how connected they were with it to...amazing watching a woman in extacy and knowimg you creating it. Makes you feel likethe man..lol.	How shit periods are. I’ve said I would like to experience what it’s like to have a period but honestly I don’t think it’s worth it. My girlfriend doesn’t complain about it but she gets sore boobs before, gets bloated, gets cramps, has sore boobs after, plus the actual blood, the pads, fear of drips, cleaning up, period poos. Then there’s the pretending like nothing’s wrong when I know she is in agony, for instance at social gatherings that are unavoidable or planned months in advance.
Men of Reddit, what is the best piece of info/advice in regard to women you’ve acquired from a woman (even post from r/AskWomen, we’ve all been there)?	Most of the advice I get from women, about women is crap but here's one gem: Don't trust them with contraception. They are programmed to procreate and some will try to trap you.	Only use a little bit of cologne, smile upon first few seconds meeting someone, and sucking on the clit like a lil weiner *(sometimes)
What is the optimal way to spread cold hard butter on bread without damaging the bread?	heat the knife, as the resident genius /u/Ksight3 suggested. Or, be sensible and heat the bread or butter, you cad.	Use the knife to take a very thin layer of the butter and put it on the bread gently. Do this quickly until the bread is covered.
What do you think can be done to help low self esteem and insecurity in men?	Acknowledge that men suffer from problems just like women do. I don't mean turn issues about women into issues about men through hijacking them, I mean admitting that men have issues alongside women. Men have issues with body image, homelessness, low self-esteem, mental illness etc. and they should be treated seriously when discussed in the news. We should stop trivialising men's issues just because we have typically been the more privileged sex.	When you go under let's say for example Instagram: Woman posts a selfie or a butt pic-->Several likes. Compliments from both men and women. "You are beautiful" etc Male posts selfie-->fewer likes. Less to no compliments. Some compliments from men-almost none from women. It appears men don't get much social support which may contribute to any low self-esteem or insecurity.
What was your worst "my SO can never know about this" story that didn't involve any sort of infidelity?	I dropped off university. I smoke, a lot more than she thought. I think her sister has sexy boobs & also, amazing 1 of a kind tits. Edit: PS: I know I have friends surfing reddit and she doesn't. Remember the brocodes, motherfuckers. I trust you.	My dog destroyed a pair of shoes she left at mine, so I threw them away. I get a call... "Did I leave my shoes at yours?" "Nah I've looked everywhere, can't find them." Wouldn't even be a big issue if the truth came out, she loves my dog, but I've got my boy's back & I'm in way too deep.
Women who hit rock bottom in their 20's, that are now successful, what made you change?	My early twenties was like "I don't wanna be an adult I wanna be 14 I don't want no job." It was horrible, everyone thought I was crazy for not learning how to drive, family was not supportive. They thought I was a lazy bastard. Ok, I kind of was. But after my dad died I dropped out of college. After that I was lost. I then started beauty school and got a job, bought my own fucking car with my own fucking money. I'm not a lazy bastard no more everyone who was not supportive can kiss my ass.	The thing that turned my ass around was realizing the problem was not just that I was picking the wrong guys, but also that I was the type of girl that heroin addicted grocery store workers wanted to date. And that wasn't who I wanted to be. I wanted to be successful, happy, fit, and to have hobbies besides drinking and yelling at my boyfriends for drugs. So I refused to date the lowest common denominator. I started eating healthy. I started exercising. These things pulled me out of my depression. I finished school because I could finally do it. My depression has come back and my healthy eating fluctuates, but for the most part, I'm way better off. I have a decent job and a good car and an awesome SO. I have learned to cook (rather well, I might add), I've learned so much about my body.
What's the worst thing you've ever said to someone who had a one-sided crush on you?	Something along the lines of "I hope you die of cancer" while cuddling on a bench in a park. Yeah I am mostly just sharing this story because it sounds really weird I guess.	Nothing. Not saying anything hurts the most, as it leaves said person in a state of confusion. Plus, it wastes both your and that persons' time.
In your experience, what are the differences between having sex with skinny girls, chubby girls and athletic girls?	Chubby girls are NOT my thing. Never have never will. I prefer athletic bodies. There's nothing greater than a girl who squats.	Skinny girls: You can man handle them. Toss em around. Hold them up hold them down, etc etc. Lots of possibilities. Chubby: Typically pretty fucking good at sex honestly. There is the long touted myth of them being great at head and I've only received evidence of it being true. Also been ridden *EXCEPTIONALLY* well by a "chubby" girl. Athletic: Their bodies are just amazing to see naked really. Not much difference from a skinny girl to an athletic girl. Other than the muscles in legs/stomach that you'll some times see that can be cool if that's your cup of tea.
What's a secret you're keeping that could destroy a relationship?	That my dad is a loser and a failure. I think he already knows this, but he has to at least feel like his son thinks something of him. If I told him how I truly felt, he would probably kill himself. I'm not sure that would be a bad thing.	The older I get, the more I realize that my mom is not the shining person I idolized in my youth. She's scared of anything outside her bubble, closed minded, and stuck in the past. She'd be crushed if she knew. Edit: As I read replies this morning I'm re-qualifying what I've said here. She's still a good person at heart and, even though she'd be incredibly sad to hear my original response, she'd probably have some wisdom for me along the lines of 'you're still growing up no matter how old you are' and what I saw then vs now.
What fun things did you learn about your SO when you moved in together?	That we mesh together incredibly well, especially considering we moved in together after only two months of dating! Oh and he sings while doing the dishes, along with dancing around shirtless while wearing a fedora :)	Okay, so we didn't move in together, but I did stay with him for three and a half months over one summer. I learned * he can literally stay in bed all day every day and be okay with that * when he does dishes, he doesn't rinse anything and he puts dishes with caked-on stuff into the sink with no water and calls it "soaking" * he's really bad at remembering to change laundry from the washer to the dryer * he likes to come in while I'm showering just to look at me and smile * he's great with his dog - she doesn't like to eat away from humans, so he'll sit with her while she eats
Why do you think male bisexuality is so uncommon and stigmatized compared to female bisexuality?	Post has been locked since people can't play nice, and because of excessive reporting where no rules are being broken. Sorry.	Post has been locked since people can't play nice, and because of excessive reporting where no rules are being broken. Sorry.
Out of all the shirts you own, what are the only 4 you actually wear?	I have the opposite problem. I'd love to wear a different shirt every day of the week but I only have like 4 longsleeve shirts and it's already getting to winter here.	I literally have a work shirt rotation and wear the same 4-5 shirts every week. Tts become a joke whenever I get a new shirt at work. Makes life a lot easier lol
Men, how do you deal with knowing potential SO is still friends with ex?	The top comment is such insecure pathetic bullshit. If he's a man and not a boy he'll just get over it, or not care to begin with. Adults maintain friendships with former partners all the time. Hell, my aunt is good friends (as is my whole family, his son is one of my best friends) with a guy she was MARRIED to decades ago. EDIT: You never fail to disappoint me with your fragile egos and paranoia, r/askmen	I'll contrast two women I date/d who maintained friendships with exes. Ex girlfriend was prone to severe attention seeking behaviour. She maintained friendships with one night stands. I didn't like it because it did not paint a picture of what a faithful committed relationship was like. She told me I was jealous and controlling. We broke up because she weaponized my feelings against me and tried to say the same to our social circle. All but two of the people in the social circle knew her to use sex as social currency. Current girlfriend was friends with some of her exes, doesn't actively seek attention from them. The biggest difference? The moment he showed disrespect for our relationship she told him to pound sand. Adults can talk about their feelings. Adults can respect their partner's feelings.
Have you ever looked back at your previous crushes and went "what was I thinking"?	Well, in the US... 1/2 of all women become hamplanets with age. So at least that many of your crushes are going to seem really sketchy by the time you are 40.	Yes. I think it's the ones where you no longer find them attractive that are the worst. It's sort of a mental puzzle to try and work out what your thought processes could possibly have been at the time. If you see some girl you once crushed on, who was not a great person, who cheated, and whose life was pure concentrated drama...but she still had boobs bigger than her head, you at least know you were just betrayed by your penis again.
What is your best advice for job-hunting?	When handing in your resume, make sure to ask to see the manager and give it directly to them yourself. This allows them to put a face to your name and gives you the opportunity to introduce yourself.	Your experience is going to be something like this: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO *YES* Remind yourself, after the tenth NO, that no matter how many NOs you are getting, you only need one YES.
What was the last straw that ended your relationship, was it one big thing or a bunch of little things?	I had lost feelings for her long before, but was too cowardly to admit it. So I cheated. She eventually found out, as one always does, and ended it. It's not a mistake I will ever make again.	She stood me up for her own birthday date that I had planned, despite the fact that it was for an experience that was a childhood dream of hers. When she rolled in six hours after we were supposed to have left, drunk as hell and unapologetic, I knew the relationship was dying without hope of resuscitation and euthanized it on the spot.
For those who have been cheated on, looking back, did you know something was off while it was happening? How did it affect your relationship even when it was a secret?	The first time, I knew. He was distant and as stupid as it sounds, there was one girl who was posting weird things on his Facebook (she later posted something about them dating on Facebook and that's how I found out!) The second time I had no idea. We were solid, we were talking all the time, we were open about our feelings. I knew he was panicking about a recent commitment we were taking, so I was ready for him to have a freakout, and he just wasn't having it... well, that I knew about.	I figured something was up, but wasn't sure. He was very good at lying and covering his tracks. He worked odd hours at the law enforcement center so if he picked up extra hours here or there I didn't think anything about it. That also meant he was rarely working during the hours I was. I actually had someone tell on him to me anonymously on Facebook. Confronted him and more lies. Eventually the shit hit the fan when I was contacted again by someone else that sent me proof. He had been cheating for years with several different women over the course of our marriage. Took me a while to pick myself up and realize I didn't deserve that treatment and no one does. Getting screwed in the head for years takes some time to undo.
What's your favorite misheard lyric?	I always sing Mirrors by Justin Timberlake as: And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy Cummin' back into you once I fingered an owl You were right here all along	My coworker honestly believed the opening to "No Scrubs" goes "A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly, also known as a bus stop." And now I sing it like that all the time.
Redditor girls on their late 20's/30s's: what would you do differently regarding sex, dating, guys, relationships on your college days, given the hindsight on life experiences you have now?	Maybe a bit off topic, but can we stop describing women as "girls", please? I would not call a male in his 30s a "boy", and there is no female equivalent to "guy". (The word "gal" immediately brings square-dancing to mind.)	I wish I did not waste so much energy caring what I looked like naked. So many times when get frisky I would be worried about what my belly looked like in positions, or having visible cellulite on my ass and thighs. I could have had much better sex if I quit being self conscious. That was the biggest discovery for me in my late 20s. Once I learned that a dude enjoying naked time with me knows I am not a magazine dream queen and wants me anyway, sex got a whole lot better. Seriously. Embrace your body for what it is and the fun things you can do with it.
What is the worst behavior you've seen explained away with "boys will be boys" or "it's a guy thing"?	Please keep in mind that all responses must be on topic to the original question.

What was the most WTF wet dream you ever had?	Aliens invaded the cheese counter of my childhood closest super market. I tried to get rid of them, but as I approached them, time would slow down for me, allowing them to evade. I love cheese, and as a kid, I always had this dream when feverish.	I was fucking a girl doggy style when I came she turned around and had the face of Ray William Johnson .
What made you realize you were in love with someone?	If everyone else in the world suddenly died except you two would that be: 1. Sad 2. Perfect If 2, you're in love	You know that feeling you had in your stomach on Christmas morning? You know everything is okay and you feel excited, happy, content and even a little bit sad for some reason? When I looked at my boyfriend and felt that feeling, I knew I loved him.
What is a relationship dynamic you don't like, but that you consider necessary to the overall health of the relationship?	I personally cannot stand that some people just keep complaining about work. "Oh I've had SOOO much to do today and I'm totally swamped and I'm gonna have to stay in the office longer and omg so much to do" My SO tells me it's normal for people to complain about work, but all I hear is: "I can't manage my own workload/tasks so I'm gonna reveal how terrible I am at my job". ...what?! I feel like I'm the only person happy with their work.	Pretending that I care about things that I don't care about or find stunningly boring. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and listen.
How common is this thought amongst friends?	It sounds like you're trying to get in her pants, but if you aren't, fine...I think the real question is 'So what if you're trying to get in her pants?' It's none of their business.	Sounds like you're a nice guy. I might think your actions were a sign of your romantic interest if you didn't do nice things for other people, but I would probably believe you if you said you two were just friends.
What 3 books have you read that you think expanded your mind? Changed your view of the world? Had the most knowledge?	Atlas Shrugged. It's dense and at times clungly and plodding but wow! a real eye-opener into who owes what to whom. Anthology of Shakespeare's plays to see that human drama has always been the same through out history. Finally, Ecclesiastes from the Bible to see that there truly is 'nothing new under the Sun,.	Crime and Punishment. Hands down my favorite book; incredibly philosophical and thrilling. Basically you go into the mind of a troubled young man who decides to murder his landlady for the greater good of society, as she was known for ripping people off. You follow his reasoning behind it and his attempts to avoid being caught.
Men of reddit, what is something you've been discouraged from doing because you're male?	Raping women. Thank god I was taught what it was and discouraged from doing it, otherwise I'd probably be raping women right now /s	Take care of my son as much as his mother. That includes finishing work early to go get him after daycare, missing work when he is sick or be the one who is notified by the daycare center when something goes wrong. People always expect the mother to do those things.
How do you deal with that girlfriend's girlfriend who is always single yet gives "useful" advice that clearly sabotage your long term relationship while your girlfriend considers her BFF?	Quickly & quietly! 😂 Seriously tho, I don't have to. My SO doesn't put up with nonsense from other broads & purposely chooses to have limited female friends/interaction due to most "Bitches being Crazy" She deals with enough of their nonsense on staff, daily. IME, can't say I really blame/disagree with her.	This was a few years ago. I was working nights at the time, so during the day I was fast asleep. My wife woke me up sometime around noon and told me I need to go help her with the yard work. Me, being confused af, ask her why in the hell she's waking me up. It turns out our friendly neighbor-lady saw my wife mowing, and politely informed her that mowing is the "man's job" and my wife should get my lazy ass out of bed to go help. "Honey," I said, "how many times has our neighbor been divorced?" "Oh, shit, you're right. Go back to sleep." And from then on she didn't take any more advice from our neighbor.
How intensely do you feel emotions? Am I "insensitive"?	I think emotions are pretty important so you're missing out on something if you don't have them. Because men are discouraged from showing emotion I'm always a bit skeptical when a fellow dude says they can't feel emotion. Maybe they can but they've learned to turn it way down/ off, I think. Edit-- why am I down voted?	Not sure how "normal" it is, but I'm the exact same way. My parents will ask me how I feel when X is happening, or if I'm excited for X in the near future. I always tell them that I don't experience excitement the same way they do. Aunt dies, sister goes to a new country, meet my half-sister for the first time in my life. All are important events, and I recognize them as such, but they just don't register much of an emotional response from me.
Have you ever slept with a good friend? How did it happen, and what came of it?	Eh, we didn't really sleep together, we were watching TV cuddling/spooning, one thing led to another and as the great Red Green says, "If a woman doesn't find you handsome, she should at least find you handy." But we stopped hanging out to watch movies or TV because we can't trust ourselves now.	Yes. We'd been drinking together regularly and the flirting had slowly gotten more and more physical, and we were both single. Sent her a not sober text saying I wanted her after one of those nights of drinking, woke up to a reply saying she did too. Explored that for a few days and we seem to be moving toward a relationship, so so far, so good.
For sexual assault survivors, did you have trouble calling it rape due to the circumstances (i.e. he claimed you consented but you don't remember)? How did you get over that, or did you?	I definitely have a hard time calling it rape. He was my boyfriend at the time and I would have consented to most (not all) of it had I been sober, but I was so drunk that I couldn't even hold myself up. I broke up with him shortly afterward for other reasons but for a few months I kept trying to talk to him and wanted to get back together. It wasn't until a year or two later when I was starting to have issues being intimate with my husband that I admitted to myself I had been assaulted and it could be affecting me. I'm ashamed of what happened during the assault but I'm just as ashamed of how badly I wanted him back afterward.	I have difficulty calling it rape because it started out consensual. And while it very quickly turned into me saying no and him doing stuff anyways (followed by violence and not letting me leave), I have a hard time. Nor did it necessarily affect me. I have moments, but nothing debilitating. I also kinda just went along with everything he did, as a means of self preservation. So in my head, because I wasn’t resisting, I don’t feel like I was victim. I called it a bad one-night stand for a long time, until I described the night to my husband, who informed me that it very much was something more.
What do you think of sex robots?	I find them really creepy, mainly because of the uncanny valley effect. I don't see how anyone can be aroused by a human like machine that's going through the motions. I think the idea of them sounds better than what the reality will be.	If it gives sexually frustrated people of any gender an outlet they otherwise wouldn't have I say go for it, science.
[Serious] Women, what is your biggest regret?	Giving so much to cishet men. Done trusting them so they can assault me/ step on me to boost themselves. I've lost so much time & money on them.	My biggest regret is spending too much time in relationships where someone treated me like garbage. I did it twice, although the second time I got out much quicker.
How did your daily routine change after moving in with your SO?	She's hella horny in the mornings. So I wake up to a warm mouth on my morning wood. Wouldn't change a thing.	That I need to get up and get ready before his morning 20-minute long poop. We are getting two bathrooms in our next place.
Has a close friend ever tried to steal your relationship, what happened?	I was not close friends with the guy but I was close friends with the girl, and had a crush on her. He let her spend more than a few weekends alone with me on trips, which I would have trouble allowing knowing how it turned out. I thought I was doing fine hiding my feelings, but she eventually decided that her relationship had burnt out and she had feelings for me instead. I feel bad about it because I hate "vine-swinging" but I did keep the moral high ground as much as possible - I never touched her while they were a couple. She had a conversation with him before asking me out, and is still friends with him but never sees him in person.	Something similar happened to me with a friend. He was not a very close friend but I hung out with him a lot because he was new in town and I wanted him to meet people. He started inviting my gf to drinks and forgetting to invite me as well. She let me know and he acted like it was all a misunderstanding. Time has passed and my gf of the time and myself broke up and are both in new relationships. I still talk to her and apparently he tried his luck with her as soon as we broke up, and when she turned him down tried to hook up with her bestfriend. Now he tries to invite me to hang out every now and then and doesn't take the hint when I don't answer. Classy guy.
Guys who ended up getting your dream girl, how did it turn out?	Married after two years, 7 year old kid together, we were extremely happy with each other and in love, at least I thought so. Then we got divorced and her and my daughter moved to another state with her new boyfriend. I realized the whole institution of marriage in the 21st century is stupid for guys. Most of them end up hurt, broke, and alone. I definitely made the best out of a bad situation, but still wish I would have never gotten married.	please dont put your 7 years of expectations on to her, you'll only ruin things. Just keep being you and don't worry about your status with her. I repeat, all you need to do is not ruin it! I say this because I lost my dream girl by trying to "lock it down" instead of just being the guy she was attracted to. There is no such thing as a love contract.
How did your S.O break the "fart barrier"?	Normal people don't delight in farting in front of, or on, other people. Children do delight in this, because they are immature and often enjoy behaviours that challenge social conventions. I imagine the vast majority of people don't remember the first time they farted in front of a SO any more than the first time they sneezed, or burped, or scratched an itch. ITT: people with delayed development and poorly veiled scatological fetishes. Just ask him/her to shit on your chest or in your mouth, stop pretending like the ”fart barrier” is a real thing in a relationship or a sign of intimacy.	I don't recall the first time my ex farted in front of me, but I do remember her slow transition from being embarrassed to use the bathroom at my small apartment to being comfortable enough to fart *on me* for a laugh.
If feminism was renamed egalitarianism, do you think more men would get involved?	Most likely. Just like if moderate MRA renamed themselves, they'd get more women involved. But wouldn't that detract from the accomplishments of first and second wave feminists? That's shitty. Not to mention that rebranding a well established ideology seems to be more work than it's worth.	Yes, because a good number of feminists use the name to justify only focusing on women's issues, and even to justify excluding men from the group completely. And a lot of the other women in feminism just seem to go along with that, so as a male feminist you feel like no one has really got your back. If you changed the name, I think they'd have a lot less justification for doing so. You couldn't accuse men of mansplaining or derailing to shut down male voices. I'd bet a lot of reasonable people would leave the men's rights movement also. I don't want to be in the room with those guys, but feminism (at least on reddit) has sort of exiled people like me.
Ladies with periods, what's your most embarrassing period story?	Standing up at work to greet a customer and having a MASSIVE blood clot work its way past my tampon and blorp out on the floor. ... Thankfully I was behind a desk she couldn't see past and I was wearing a floor length skirt and I work alone in the shop. She went into a change room right away (I alter clothes) so I quickly ran to the back and did a warp speed tampon change. I had to leave the mess behind my desk until she was gone though. She never knew what happened, but I still felt really embarrassed.	In middle school, I was still learning how to deal with it. One day in class, I knew my pad had overflooded with blood. I got up to ask the teacher if I could use the restroom, which she said yes. I went back to my desk to grab my purse (pads inside) and saw a blood smear on my chair. Yikes. Lucky for me it was the 90s and a flannel tied around your waist did not stand out. Later my friend told me that I had a huge blood mark on the back of my jeans, and that no one said anything because they were all embarrassed. Ah, middle school.
Dual-income no kids: what’s life like for you?	Single-income two kids isn't all that bad either. Life is good when you live within your means, no matter what your situation.	We both have good careers. Our only debt is her car however we're renting the house. We can stay out late or make last minute plans whenever we want. We take a short vacation every 2 or 3 months. It does feel kind of odd now that most of our peers have children. Sometimes I forget that my friends can't always close out the bar anymore.
Wealthy single men, how do you date knowing there's a possibility the girl you're seeing may only be after you for your money and nothing else?	If I make considerably more than a girl, there’s no way it’s moving beyond casual fling/hookup. Also I generally don’t pay for a girls drinks or dinner on a date. That way I know she’s hanging around because she enjoys spending time with/fucking me.	My buddy makes six figures in his early 20s in the entertainment industry in LA. He has insane connections and women hanging all over him when they find out what he does. Whenever we go out together he tells people he works at Starbucks.
What should you know/do when your mom is dying from cancer?	Record her voice bc u will miss it. Hold her hand and never forget how soft it is. Tell her what a wonderful mom shes been. Spend as much time as possible with her bc these r moments u will never get back and if u dont u will regret it. My mom only lived 6 weeks from diagnosis to her death. I put my entire life on hold. I fell behind on my Bill's, took off from my job, whatever I had to do to be with her and I'd do it all over again a million times. When she drew her last breath my whole family was by her side and it was truly a beautiful site bc my Mom was the best there ever was and I knew heaven was next for her.

Does the "social media" boyfriend actually exist?	Yes, OP. People do occasionally do nice things for their girlfriends. You're getting a lot of weird answers here, but this subreddit seems to be filled with CHUDS.	I was drunk on my way home on Friday night and order my wife a pizza. Is that close enough
Have you ever been uncertain of your feelings towards your SO, particularly when you first started dating?	With my boyfriend and I it was nearly instantaneous. I've never been the type to actively pursue a guy, but with him it was different. He apparently felt the same way about me. He hadn't dated in 4 years and I had been in and out of abusive relationships. The only reason we didn't label it right away was that I was trying to tell myself it wasn't a relationship. Ha. Everyone I knew, *knew* it was. Now we're going stronger than ever.	Kind of. I was a bit distrustful of my ex because he had cheated on every girlfriend he had ever had before me. He ended up cheating on me too, so that ended things - but, to be honest, I wasn't far off ending things anyway. Ultimately, if it doesn't feel right, and you don't think it is something you can/want to work on, you're better off cutting your losses and moving on. Just my opinion.
Over at AskWomen, we get a lot of thinly veiled attempts to provide fetish material. Does that happen often in AskMen? And why or why not?	It seems like the /r/askmen crowd is more immature (I partly reach that conclusion based on comparing how interesting/original/serious questions are on /r/askwomen compared to /r/askmen) and welcomes such topics, often asking them to themselves. People here like talking about their fantasies, it seems. I don't think we get as many women fishing for fetish material for some reason, but I get the feeling that many wish we did, and that's why they just settle for making the lewd questions themselves. Edit: Heh, the reasonable replies to this comment have me somewhat changing my mind actually. Perhaps I was too harsh.	No. But we do get a lot of women fishing for compliments or trying to justify their lack of effort dating.
Women of color, is there anything popular TV shows or movies do to appeal to you that really annoys you?	I am loving the HBO series Insecure as F&@k. I started watching it out of boredom, but I was instantly hooked. I'm not the show's demographic (43 yr old white woman), but I love it.	I'm not a big fan of throwing the token "ethnic" person into the show who is super 2D. And worse, when they try to show either exaggerated versions of them in either direction (either they're the super stereotypical version of that ethnicity or they're the polar opposite like so unbelievably "white" it's too much). Is that what you were asking for?
Who is hotter: Aragorn or Legolas?	This was on a buzzfeed quiz!! my boyfriend and I got into a tiny fight over it because I think Aragorn is hotter and he thinks Legolas is hotter	Aragorn. That introduction scene in the Prancing Pony where you just see his eyes under the hood is *swelteringly* hot.
Have you quit a well-paying job that crushed your soul to work in a job that paid much less/maybe entry level? What was your experience?	I took a considerable pay cut when I left my last job. My application for the current job was being processed at the time I was laid off (due to downsizing), so technically I didn't quit, but I would have even though the pay was less, because I was going from a boring, repetitive job to a creative, enjoyable one that suited my education. It took me about 3 years to get back to my old pay scale and I still enjoy the job after 9 years. Edit: The pay cut wasn't so bad that I couldn't support myself, I just needed to be more careful with my money for a while.	Yes. I took a 50% pay cut to leave my soul-sucking analyst job to work as a program manger for an education non-profit. I had to downsize my living situation and start working part time at the Gap to make ends meet, but even in light of that, I was a much happier person. I didn't find the financial aspect to be sustainable, so I actually changed careers again and am now in a completely different field that I love AND that pays well. For me, it was a much needed reset on my overall perspective on life and though short-lived was absolutely necessary and worthwhile. In my "soul-sucking" job I felt trapped doing something I hated 50 hours a week. The non profit gig helped me realize that I had some control over my life.
What are some funny/cringy things you've had said to you by a customer at your job?	Older guys keep hiring on me. One of the common ways is asking me over to cook. My answer is to just laugh and tell them if they want a date with me, they're the ones that need to cook me dinner. Gets a chuckle every time. But, really, my boyfriend does most of the cooking. I'm a modern woman.	A couple years ago, I worked at Chick-Fil-A. One day, this lady pulled up in the drive-thru and before I could even get out the usual "hi how are you" she asks me "do you hate gay people?" Apparently she thought that since the founder of CFA was against gay marriage, everyone who worked there must hate gay people. Even after explaining that's not true, she proceeded to say she just can't support a company like that but then gives me her card to pay for her food. It was weird.
What's the most inappropriate non-sexual thing a coworker has told you?	"I don't like black people." I didn't even know this woman's last name. Also "ugh my crotch smells like fish". Lady I don't even know what department you work in!!	This is sexual but it's not harrassment. I had a co-worker whose husband had a micropenis and was a terrible lover. I *really* didn't want to know anything about his junk or imagine both of them having sex. Sometimes she'd start crying in the middle of work and I'd try hard to avoid her so I didn't have to listen to micropenis stories. Same co-worker had a smooth tongue (?) she was always talking about. Sometimes she'd stick it out and demand that we inspect it. It made everyone uncomfortable. She also frequently cried about her tongue.
What’s an appropriate amount of sexual aggressiveness to expect from your wife?	If she won't initiate, then she's probably not gonna change. That's just how some women are. They have all kinds of BS hangups and they worry about stupid shit like.... "I know he's my husband and all but if I initiate sex he'll think I'm a slut and leave me." Stupid shit like that. Go find one that isn't insecure about telling you she wants to fuck.	Her inability / refusal to have a rational conversation about it is a much bigger issue than the one that sparked your original question. I wish I had a solution for that one, but every relationship I've had that had "minefields" that overlapped with things one of us wasn't satisfied with in our relationship it ended, badly. You shouldn't expect her to tolerate you interrogating her about why she isn't jumping you every time you come home, but it's totally unreasonable that she gets upset every time you ask her reasonable questions about a topic that's rather important to a successful marriage. Communication is important, consider seeing a couple's therapist.
What have you experienced that was later explained by finding out you were pregnant?	I've never been pregnant, but my cousin was, and I didn't know. For several months, my cousin was not ready to announce her pregnancy. Whenever we would go out, she stopped drinking wine with dinner, which we would always do. She also refused going out for sushi, which was a favorite of ours. She kept saying she had something to tell me but wasn't ready to do so. I thought she was going to say she was an alcoholic and was going into AA (she didn't seem like an alcoholic, but I don't know her personal habits). One night, she finally said she was going to tell me this secret of hers. As soon as she said, "I'm pregnant," I blurted out,"I'm so proud of you!" :P	I'm not sure it counts because I was actually on my way to buy a pregnancy test, but as I walked in the drugstore the smell of all the perfumes was too much. I threw up on their welcome mat - no warning, I couldn't even turn my head. I felt ridiculous buying the test, the cashier was looking at me like, You really don't need to buy this.
Why is it socially acceptable for women to have sex toys but automatically weird whenever a guy does?	I think we need to differentiate between different kinds of sex toys. There's practically no stigma about the kind that men insert their penises into. Look at the movie American Pie. I remember when I was in grade school, guys talked all the time about how they masturbated, using lotions, making DIY-fleshlights (the most common, I think, was sponges inside of a bottle...), etc. On the other hand, there's a bunch of stigma against guys putting things up their butts, because that would be considered gay and unmasculine.	I have no idea. I'm a guy, and I have both dildos and a fleshlight. I just let them go at it, leave me out of it
What mind games have been attempted on you?	broke up with me because they weren't sure if they loved me then proceeded to get jealous and frustated when i started moving on and talking to new people	I “might” come over later ... After this happened several times seeing the pattern that around 7pm he’d say “can’t make it Now” - i realised it was to keep me inside and doing nothing. Total control. Ugh!
What do you wish more guys knew?	Quit beating around the bush, man. Seriously. I know a lot of girls enjoy the subtle flirting shit, but listen. I am *not in tune with my own attractiveness.* if you want me to suck your dick, **ask me to suck your dick.** I'll probably say no, because I'm gay. But if you never actually tell me you intend to have sex with me, I am **going** to assume were bros and be even *more* freaked out when you make a move. I'm gay. I'm not gonna blow you. Now do you wanna play video games or not? (Note: also applies to women. If you want me to blow you, please just ask. I'm as thirsty as a twelve year old white boy.)	I think the secret to getting laid well and often is being emotionally forthcoming and available. Especially in a relationship. Women need to feel safe to have sex with you. If you've been lying about weird shit (things that seem like they don't matter) and avoid talking things out, you're making yourself unavailable to fuck her later. HEED ME
What are some tangible ways you reduced your emotional labour workload? What were the results, and how do you feel?	Getting out of retail helped immensely, no need to play that game when you're not expected to put on the happy face to help customers. I absolutely refuse to go into anything similar once I finish my degree, I'm planning on doing more consulting than customer service If you're talking about this new definition of 'emotional labour' aka taking care of family and sharing the domestic workload, well, I just don't choose men who can't take care of themselves. Why would I ever let myself get into that situation in the first place?	I've been trying to do this with my writing group. I'm in a fiction writing group that meets in rooms that need to be reserved at the library. Eventually I realized that, as the only woman, the men in the group kind of expected me to set up the appointments, get the rooms ready, etc. I'm trying to avoid this emotional /mental labor of organization by stopping setting this up but they still expect me to do it. I'm trying to figure out a way to straight up tell them to figure it out or do a rotation etc.
Is anyone else super turned off when men list "not crazy" as one of their requirements for a romantic partner?	I think it's perfectly reasonable. I'm a lady and listed "no scumbags" on my Internet dating profile. I'm just tired of dating scumbags and I'm sure most dudes are tired of dating batshit crazy ladies.	Yes, because it's tacky. It gives me the impression that he sits around with his buddies and talks about how 'bitches be crazy'. If we have a disagreement, I feel he'd be more likely to dismiss my viewpoint on the basis of that I'm a woman, and women are certified psychos. I try to see people as individuals. If a guy has a not-so stellar moment, I don't automatically assume he's a jerk or an asshole. I don't want people making assumptions about me based on a characteristic that they think is inherent to my gender.
What behaviour from other men do you find the most cringey?	I will get downvoted but screw it I'll be honest, excessively homosexual men (faggotry), limp-wristed lispy fruitiness, I can only imagine the disappointed father when I see it. Downvoted Brigade Engage.	Being so desperate to be macho and cool that they pick fights over dumb shit and think every single thing in life is a competition. It makes them look like insecure cocksuckers, and it makes them a total drag to be around.
How hard is wall sex?	Grown women are heavy. I mean at what age do you stop picking up your kids? Five, six? And then they don't even weigh half of a grown woman. Don't believe what you see in movies.	Less difficult than standing sex, more difficult than bed sex. The wall provides extra support so it's actually not too difficult to support her weight while going to town. I recommend if you're not strong enough to just outright pick her up, balance and put your dick in her while holding her, start while sitting on a couch or the edge of the bed with her on top and then pick her up and walk towards the wall.
What do men unintentionally say to you that they don't think is sexist but is?	When a guy finds out I'm in a relationship and he says "oh, he's sure a lucky guy". This especially annoys me because why can't I be the lucky one, as I actually feel I am? If it's a good relationship, which it is, my boyfriend and I should both feel equally lucky. And I do feel that way. To a lesser degree, it also annoys me because I'm bisexual and actually have a boyfriend and a girlfriend right now. I know that's too complicated for many to explain that to, but I don't think any guy as ever approached me and even considered the option I may be in a relationship with a woman. I'm not seeking attention that way, but it does bother me at times when everyone assumes you only are attracted to men.	I work in a male dominated industry and get a lot of comments from male coworkers about how surprised they are that I "turned out to be" so smart/competent/authoritative/professional etc. after they've gotten to know me. I let it slide because I know they mean well and they're not the most socially capable group of dudes but WOW talk about a backhanded compliment! I've also found that when I'm the only woman in a work group or area, I'm constantly asked how to fax things, reserve a conference room, to organize a potluck, etc. I'm not the Office Administrator and I'm definitely not your mommy.
What movies/tv shows do you have a hard time watching due to its sexism?	The Sandlot. I just watched this for movie night for the first time with my husband and three sons. I was upset enough to not finish watching the movie and to tell my husband how upset I was that he didn’t pause to talk about consent and sexual assault after the lifeguard scene. Plus there were the insults degrading females...	I used to love Funny Face... until watching it a few days ago and now seeing it as a film about a man who uses his position of power to manipulate and take advantage of a naive girl half his age. And because he realises that the man the girl is actually interested in is doing the exact same thing, somehow that makes him a hero? He even tells her "he's no more interested in your intellect than I am!" and we're supposed to be rooting for them to get together? What the actual fuck?
Women of reddit, what are your favourite pet/nicknames to be called while dating?	None. If someone called me babe or honey, I would have to say something. If they didn't stop, I would ghost them.	I told my SO that I didn't like 'babe', so now he calls me 'Captain' or 'Cap'. I kind of love it :)
Is Religion a turnoff for you?	Yes. Anyone who's willing to ascribe the cause for something to an invisible friend is not someone I would want to make a life with.	If she prevents me from eating pig meat, or forces me to go to church every sunday morning, then we have a problem. Until her religion starts affecting me aswell, we're totally fine.

What does it mean when a man says "society views me as expendable"?	Genital mutilation. Couple girls start having it done in countries halfway across the world and there is a global call for action. Nearly all men had their genitals mutilated here in the US and no one cares that it was done without our consent.	Well, for one, all those god damn "Let's end Women's cancer!" banners plastered all over the walls every time I go in for chemo. What am I, chopped liver?
What is that one shallow or seemingly trivial thing that annoys you in your relationship, and that you've considered breaking up with your SO over?	If I find myself constantly having to lower my intelligence to have a conversation with you, or if you can't discuss things without it turning into a full blown fight then I'm ending it. I had one ex with whom I could be myself, have intellectually stimulating conversations, AND we could debate without it coming between us......I miss her.	As a woman who loves cooking and baking, trying new stuff, my SO has the blandest pallet and the things he will eat mean I only ever feed us the same 5 or 6 things. I've tried everything, but he won't eat any red meat apart from ground beef for some reason, cheese, milk, eggs, cream, fish, vegetables....nothing!
At what age did you grow out of your party phase?	As long as you’re not using this “Party Phase” euphemism as an excuse to get trashed and be reckless all the time. There is a time to grow up and starting acting mature and professional. It doesn’t mean that you can’t have some drinks or occasionally party… Bottom line, if you’re in your 30’s going to the bar/club every weekend and getting plastered… you’re not really “enjoying life” and you definitely need to grow up. Question, how much of your partying involves altering your chemical state?	My party phase died out in my mid-twenties. I still like having fun and drinking some beers with the buds don’t get me wrong but we are more akin to the guys from King of the Hill than Jersey Shore. We’re all chill, drink a few beers and just talk. I still hit it pretty hard a few times a year but constantly going out drinking/partying not so much.
Anybody ever feel like they've "outgrown" their longtime friends? How did you handle it?	You got to be able to shut that person out of your life if they hold you back. Sounds cruel, but that’s just what I had to learn with my former best.	Before a certain age, our set of friends is constrained by geography. As you get older, you realize you can have friends that actually have similar interests.
We hear a lot about attractive women frustrated that a lot of her male friends are just trying to get in her pants - attractive men, do you have the same problem with your female friends &amp; how much do you hate it?	No, because women never initiate. They just sort of awkwardly hover nearby waiting for you to make the first move. That's easy enough to ignore.	I can't agree I'm attractive, but I get a fair amount of attention and female friends who want to sleep with me but it never severely bothers me nor do I hate it. Women seem to be more subtle about expressing it either way and I never put myself in situations where I'm alone with them. Only irritates me a slight bit since I'm more of a super-longterm relationship kind of guy and dislike the idea of one night stands.
Men with an unusual "type", what is it?	I kinda feel like I'm in the minority saying big tits are fucking gross and not even remotely attractive. There is nothing good about them.	I've always been a fan girls with saggy tits. Way back in the day, god this is going to sound so bad. My girlfriend at the time had a younger sister. We were over her place (the younger sister) because she just moved into a new apt and we were helping her move in. Well, she had just recently had a baby and she was talking about how her tits were saggy and she hated it. It was strange because she brought it up several times out of nowhere. And she said it like she was really mad. I remember thinking I wanted to ask her if I could see them just to see how saggy they really were. And I was so turned on by her just saying that. God I'm fucked up. No I didn't ask. I don't know why I'm telling this story.
What's the best escape tactic if your Tinder date is much uglier in real life?	I would straight up tell the person that she does not look at all what she does in her profile and that I'm not happy to have been lied to. Then take my leave.	This is why it's a good idea to plan those kind of first dates to be short, so have an easy out if you need it. Go for a quick coffee or something to start. It's easy to try and extend a date if it's going well or see if they want to go somewhere else nearby, but it's harder to just bail in the middle.
Farted while talking on the phone right before our first date. She started laughing. What do I do now?	Grow up. Once you get past 16 years-old check to see if you're mature enough to be in any kind of relationship.	Well, she did not hang up on you and reject further conversation, so that is good. Never mention it again and move on. Repeat: do not mention your gaseous habits.
What's your advice for an unattractive woman?	like, for real for real practical advice? grow your hair super long and take really good care of it good hair is like 50% of above the neck attractiveness if not more imo probably update the wardrobe obviously weight is important also just looking like you care can read as attractive. so just by doing your hair and make-up and dressing intently i think has an effect.	Go to a professional and get a make over. You're probably not as unattractive as you think. Take care of your body, find out how to choose clothing that suits you. If for some reason you are unattractive even after putting in the effort, focus your energy on things other than looks and dating. There's a LOT to explore in this world and dating/marrying/having sex is over rated and the fun of it definitely fades over time. Study, travel the world, find other things that interest you and dedicate yourself to them. Looks fade, intelligence tends to last a bit longer.

Outdoorsy women of Reddit, how do you deal with the "lady things" when roughing it?	First of all, if you're on the pill, makes things a lot easier, you know when it's coming. make sure you burry everything you use. Honestly it's not as bad as you think... Kind of just gotta realize it's going to be awkward.. Usually whenever I peed, I'd find a tree, squat with my back against it.	I have a go girl which makes peeing easier. Although I did end up getting a mosquito bite on my ass. Definitely practice a lot if you're doing this! I'd say a diva cup is probably a really good idea if you have somewhere with water you can wash it out. If not, just use whatever you normally do and keep that stuff ziplocked!
Unmarried straight men: How much do you fear impregnating a lady?	I am one of the apparently rare abstinence types. I'd just like to reserve that level of intimacy for marriage. So, zero fear of impregnating a lady. :) Maybe it's not for everyone, but I'm 21 and the quality of my intercourse-less life has been pretty stellar so far.	I wouldn't entrust my sexual health and financial well-being to a woman who expects me to believe she's on birth control just because she says so. Wrap up.
When it comes to dating, what misconceptions do you find women have about being a single man?	If you're single, you must be an asshole who masturbates into his pants every night, then goes on 4chan to talk shit about women.	Apparently, if a guy expresses interest in someone, getting into her pants is the sole motivation for everything he's done around her, ever. Also, there's this misconception that any bit of affection will be taken sexually.
at work, how do you ask someone nicely to do a task themselves (when they're trying to offload it on to you when they could and should do it themselves)?	“You are the fucking worst” and then it’s a game of forget chicken and whoever remembers first has to do it. Not the most effective but it’s worked for 2 years	This is something I had to learn how to do. They’re not asking for help because they’re struggling, they’re just being lazy. You just look at them sincerely and say “I’m sorry, I’m busy in my stuff right now. If you have questions because you’re struggling, I can do my best to answer them for you.” It’s not your job to do someone else’s stuff.
What are your bad breakup stories?	Geesh, a lot of these stories involve cheating and obsession. I hope you ladies don't generalize most men to be this way!	I broke up with him, he cried, wouldn't leave, proposed, then would turn up at my place randomly *for a year* asking me to marry him/suck his dick.
I went to Taco Bell yesterday, ordered at the drive thru, paid for my food and absentmindedly drove off without my food when they handed back my debit card. What dumbfuck thing have you done recently?	Last Wednesday this chick I know bought a taco from Taco Bell. There was a pubic (I think) hair stuck to the wrap.	Recently saw stopped school bus with red lights flashing. I stopped and waited. Eventually remembered I was not in a car; I was walking. Went into client office where they immediately asked why I was standing on the sidewalk \[like an idiot\].
What celebrity death has hit you the hardest?	Zero! I couldn't care less about people I don't know and who don't know me. Actors and singers are all easily replaced by the next big thing, people move on and forget the dead entertainers.	Anton Yelchin, because he was so young and the way he died just seemed like the universe wanted to give the world another middle finger.
If you could give one piece of advice to the single or unmarried women in your life, what would it be?	Stop trying to find an “emotionally available” man. We are men, not your girl friends. You can sit around and spend hours talking about your feelings with them. That’s why you have friends. Come to us with problems that you want solved. That’s what we are for.	Would you be with someone who behaved like you and had the expectations of you that you would have of a partner? No? Then make some adjustments. Be the sort of person you would want to date.
Why are your asses always exposed when you bend over?	Probably for the same reason women have 137.5 pairs of shoes on average. Just answering a gender generalization with a gender generalization (in case all the feminist snowflakes didn't get the sarcasm).	I see no other explanation than them being filthy sluts who are begging me to drop coins in there. Copper for my coppertone baby.
Do you like smart girls?	If you're in high school, you don't have the slightest clue whether you're really intelligent or not. Take your condescension somewhere else.	Yeah, of course. I don't think anyone here would say being an intellectual is a bad thing. I know a close friend who values a great conversationalist over most other things in a SO. Two things: * Don't be condescending. * Be all ears when someone talks. Not just the guy you're interested in.
Men who have never been in a romantic relationship, how do you remain confident?	If you need to be in a romantic relationship to feel confident in yourself then you should fix that. Learn to be happy on your own, you should never need to rely on another person for your own happiness and confidence. Edit: Getting downvoted for saying that you shouldn't rely on another person to feel confident/ happy? Either I understood the question wrong or y'all have a pretty sad outlook on life.	By not associating my identity with anything external. I am complete, and I am enough. I don't need to be in a relationship to feel fulfilled. It sure would be amazing, but I'm very well without.
Would or do you allow your teenage kid(s) to have sex under your roof and why?	Hell no. Do it in secret like we did. Sex is a grown up privilege like drinking and I feel it should be earned. There will be some early subterfuge, plenty failure and getting caught, but eventually you will have your own [apartment] where you can do it freely and in relative comfort.	I had a boss who had a gay son. He said he didn't mind his son and his boyfriend doing it in his home. "It's not like I have to worry about them getting pregnant," he said.
What was your experience with permanent hair removal treatments?	I am a destransitioning woman. I have a beard and all but I am afraid to use laser hair removal because testosterone pretty much ruined my skin.	I got laser hair removal and it barely worked at all. After 13 sessions, I still shave my face once a week. Any laser tech that says their machine works on light hair against light skin is scamming you. If you have dark hair against light skin, laser is great, though. Can't speak for electrolysis as I haven't tried it yet

What was the biggest wake up call in life for you?	After all my friends and family left me, i realised you can't count on anyone but yourself and relationships are not forever	I realized I was 23 and would be working at this shitty factory my entire life unless I did something. So I went to school. I still work at this shitty factory, but in addition, I also work somewhere in my preferred field and I should be able to quit here within about two years.

What is a fine line that society expects women to tread?	As a man, I'm expected to know where assertiveness ends and aggressiveness begins and avoid the latter, but all too often, when I'm in the thick of it, I occasionally slip up and say things that some would consider overbearing or overly demanding when I'm just trying to be direct. I'm just wondering what fine lines there are for women to navigate.	Wear makeup to prevent yourself looking tired or ill, but not so much that guys notice or it's trashy. Dress to impress but don't do some silly shit like showing your legs and cleavage at the same time or you're just a slag who wants attention.
Jumping off the post in /AskMen... what are the signs a guy might be too high maintenence for you to consider dating?	A guy I was dating bought powder foundation to make himself look perfect. (He didn't even have bad skin, he just wanted to look "flawless" like newscasters, celebs, etc) DEALBREAKER. I still giggle when I think about that.	Expecting me to essentially be his mother, expecting me to make all the plans. Things like that. Put your fair share of effort in, dude!
Why aren’t we taught self worth as compared to the opposite sex?	I would rather have this problem than women's I'M A GODDESS self delusion. We start low and work ourselves up. Worst that happens is you stop progressing. They start with a wholly incorrect self delusion and reality slowly turns the screws on them. Can you imagine starting with an ego the size of most movie stars only to have reality beat it out of you year by year? Worst, the "youre perfect" starts out seemingly true: endless sexual attention if youre average, no truly competitive coed environments, money and employment haven't hamstrung your free time, few opportunities to make life altering fuckup decisions. The vast majority of people are absolutely average. That's really got to start crushing the soul after the first decade. As a dude, it starts with "you probably suck at most things, so pick sports or books and stick with it."	I think while guy friends do tend to tease a lot more than girl friends, I know that if I say “real talk” to my guy friends and ask them about any insecurities I might have, they’ll try to help bring me up. Guys may just not be as serious in everyday life
Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on dress codes for girls because "it will distract the boys"?	> is our culture just becoming more and more prude? It was never acceptable to have your ass cheeks hanging out of your shorts, have your thong showing, or wear leggings/yoga pants without something on top of it. Only literal street whores wore anything resembling yoga shorts outside of the bedroom. Having a dress code isn't onerous. It also cuts down on girls bullying girls who can't afford lululemon or whatever expensive ass clothes are in style If the boys show up wearing a banana hammock to school, that should be unacceptable as well.	If that explanation is used, I find it insulting. Yes, we are horny but no, a shoulder or some cleavage won't make me go apeshit and be unable to get any work done. Saying otherwise cements the stereotype of men as sex-crazed animals. EDIT: And it's exactly my frustration over this type of thing that has made me a feminist
Do you want to "Free the Nipple"? Is it problematic for you that breasts are so linked to sex?	I think it's a ridiculous non-issue that has gotten way too much attention from... certain groups. In terms of breastfeeding, I would like to see that get de-stigmatized. Otherwise, I don't think this is a worthwhile restriction to fight for/ against, whatever their goal is. People are restricted in a society, we can't just eliminate all the rules. E: The breastfeeding thing, though. Maybe I'm just crunchy or something, but just the other day I applauded a lady for breastfeeding at a pub. She looked so touched that I took time to tell her she's awesome. I really don't get how people can be 'against' kids eating lunch in public	I'm not a fan of walking topless, because even when showing my nipples becomes legal, creeps gonna creep. But I think it's ridiculous than my female nipples are illegal while male ones are not.

Would you rather be able to eat as much as you want and not gain weight or never have your period?	Well I already have the first one. I can eat whatever the fuck I want and not gain weight. And before you go OMFG THAT'S AWESOME, YOU'RE SO LUCKY! Think again. I constantly battle with being underweight and my body, even at 25 years old is under developed and featureless because of it. I'm flat, no curves, and maintaining anything of my weight is a struggle. Sure I can shove whatever I want down into my gut, but I'm not attractive in anyway.	Eat. Definitely eat. My period is hell, but it's only a few days a month and will stop eventually. Eating is for life.
Quarantine forced us to take a hard look at ourselves. What were you surprised to discover about yourself recently?	Scary, that u ll leave home n u might not see ur family again. Trust issues. U question everyone that is close to you n in the back of ur mind u thinking hope that are true to you. Today I question my brother cos some one he was in contact couple of days ago n they are positive.	I'm tired of my abusive family and now I can accept that they will never change. Edit: wow, thank you so much for your support and for sharing your story! I've been reading you but I just rescued a kitten so I'll respond later! Thank you people!!
When did you start really caring about taking care of yourself (ie exercise, supplementation, sleep discipline etc)?	Supplements are by and large complete bullshit. If you eat even a halfway varied diet you are literally just pissing money away because your body will get rid of whatever it doesn't need at the moment. There are only 2 things anyone eating properly will ever need to supplement: Vitamin D and protein. Vitamin D because we're not in the sun as long as we should be and protein only if you are strength training.	When I got to 25 years old with no success with women, I figured that "Just being myself" and "find someone who likes you the way you are" weren't working so it was time to fix my body. Lost 70 lbs, put on some muscle, ride my bike 40 miles a week, eat healthy etc. So now I'm 28 and have no success with women, but at least I look less shit than before.

Ladies, imagine you've just started dating a guy who says he's never really had a girlfriend before. What things are you worried about?	It depends on the guy's age. University age? Totally normal to have never had a BF/GF before, and I wouldn't be worried about anything. Even into the mid 20's it's somewhat normal. Beyond the mid 20's, I'd see it as a red flag.	I married that guy - he never had a girlfriend before me. You know what? It really depends on the person. I didn't have time to worry at all as he never came across as inexperienced, nor did he do any stupid relationship BS, so I forgot he didn't have girlfriends before me. Actually treated me better (why I married him) than all the other guys I dated. He is mature in personality and had his life shit together. Latter probably the key factor.
Without giving context, what is your most upvoted comment?	Number 1 : ["Yes, and something it's a bit worrying because you can't help but think "shit, is my period starting early?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/52yzkv/what_is_a_question_youd_want_to_ask_women_but_are/d7op8fc?context=3) Number 3 (which used to be my top comment until a few weeks ago): ["What if she tells you she's coocoo for Coco Puffs?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/4n8bh2/men_whats_your_crazygirl_test/d41pssg?context=3)	Never leave the stall at the same time as someone else. Always wait until they have left so neither person ever learns the identity of their poop neighbor.
Men, how do I (F) know when I should give someone my number without them asking for it?	Twisted standards here. So it's out of place for a guy to do this kind of stuff to a girl while she's working but not vice versa? WTF	Can you read minds? - Yes: Then read them. - No: Just go with your intuition. Write the number on the cup or whatever. This is the crux in all human interaction. We can't read minds. You need to risk something.
Do you hate wearing pants?	I HATE PANTS! They rarely fit right, too tight somewhere, too loose somewhere, make me look weird at my midsection. Dresses all the way (though I do wear pants under my dresses in the winter).	I love pants. I hate *buying* pants but I love wearing them. I hate wearing skirts. I feel like I am not wearing enough clothing and like I'm playing dress-up. Also I can't sit right in them.
Barbers, what's something customers do that annoys you? What can we do to stop that?	edit: Sorry guys, I'm retarded, I wasn't thinking about where I was. That said, she cuts my hair so I don't go to a Barber but I suspect they'd expect a tip as well? My GF is a hair stylist. If she works on your hair for 4 hours a 10 dollar tip is insulting. edit: Obviously no one here understands how the hair stylist industry, primarily doing women very lengthy processes and treatments, work. I'm the idiot though, this is askmen, who cares what a female stylist wants.	Know what you want done before you go in, and when they ask explain it in detail, even better bring a picture.
What "Real Men" stereotype bothers you the most?	All of them. Don't fucking pigeon hole me. Women would be throwing a shit-fit if I said "Real women _______"	People automatically assume I'm somehow less capable of raising my daughter than my wife is. As a new dad (16 month old baby girl), I HATE being called a babysitter. "Oh, the wife let you babysit?" "How nice of dad to babysit while you go out" No. I'm a parent, and I'm fucking raising my child.
Are there any other women who think the "strangers should never talk to me" thought process is a bit extreme?	I think it's worse than extreme ... it's downright anti-social. If someone is polite and tries to strike up conversation, what's the big deal? If the person approached doesn't want to converse, they have the option to politely say so. I say no harm, no foul.	I personally don't have a problem with being approached in public as long as they back off if/when asked, but I also think it's perfectly understandable to not want to be approached whilst going about your daily activities. At a bar or club or even a gig or at the cinema is different because it's a social activity but I can't say I've ever enjoyed an interaction that started from being approached in the street or a shop or the like.
What is your favorite tree and what do you love about it?	The Joshua trees found in the Mojave desert in southern California. They're an awkward mix between evergreens and cacti and I find them so fascinating - they only thrive in a certain region within the southwest US.	Cherry blossoms. They're gorgeous and when they are in full bloom nothing can top their beauty. But they only reveal themselves for a short window every year. They're exotic and mysterious.
How can I kill a super genius mouse?	If he's this smart, you better believe he has bros who know where he is and who will avenge him if you hurt him. Option 1 is, quite simply, surrender. You have been outfoxed. Pack up and leave boys, this is mouse turf now. Leave a note to the next owner that the mouse has gotten accustomed to peanut butter with a side dish of danger and fare him well. Option 2 is to get a nonlethal trap and to release this warrior in a manner befitting his honorable spirit. He has defeated you in battle thus far; I humbly suggest you release him in a field somewhere, that he may conquer other lands and that the borders of your twin empires never meet to cause conflict again.	Former exterminator here. The little guy likes peanut butter, and he's not afraid of traps. Those are two HUGE bonuses you have going for you. Use the peanut butter very sparingly on the trap. They can smell it, and even the tiniest amount will attract them. Put it on in such a way that they have to work for it, the added motion on the trap will cause it to spring. Also, with him being on your counters, you're going to want to invest in a bleach-based cleaner once you catch it. Especially if there's a little blood. Mice are relatively clean, but you're still going to want to thoroughly sanitize every food-prep surface.
What are your shallowest relationship dealbreakers (physical or personality)?	Physical-Overweight. Honestly it has never been about actually being overweight. Unless its a genetic disorder, it shows you have no self control and don’t give a shit about yourself. Personality-Relying on people to get you out of shit situations you got yourself in in the first place. Living your life like it’s a video game. Long story-Both attributes I mentioned show a huge lack of personal responsibility. Huge turn-off	My shallowest dealbreaker is when country music is their favorite music genre. I'm fine with old school country, but modern country music in my opinion is an abomination. Along with that, as someone who grew up in a really rural area (school closed for a week growing up during the county fair because 99% of the school was showing animals) anyone who grew up in a city and pretends they are so "country" drives me up the wall.
Currently eating a block of cheese, what's your go to snack?	Carbs. Nom nom nom. Delicious sugarsss. Or fruit when I'm trying to convince myself that eating copious amounts is still healthy.	Tonight I went to the grocery store with full intentions of getting vegetables for stir fry for dinner. I came home with egg nog and crispy minis
Have you ever had your work ethic crushed by a workplace where it was not rewarded? How did this happen, and did you ever recover from it?	I don’t know if this counts for the intended demographic, but as a sahm that’s an EMPHATIC YES. Affirmative. I have so much sympathy for people who work under conditions in which their time, effort, talent, and ethic are unnoticed. Feeling invisible eats up your morale and motivation... the only thing that’s slowed my growing apathy train is reframing my purpose from external reward to personal development.	I’m young, so don’t have much experience in the work force. But from my own little experience, working harder does not mean you will get proper recognition and compensation for it. For me, other coworkers continued to slack, or knew I would “fix” or take care of issues. Managers didn’t really notice either way. If they did, nothing came of it.
Ladies, what is the most unexpected thing that made you feel good about yourself recently?	I call my boyfriend "my handsome buck" (He's a hunter) and today, for the first time ever, he called me "my beautiful doe"	Today someone told me that I am very open/honest about things and that I articulate myself really well. This is something that I’ve been working on for years.
Guys, What is something that your S.O. Does that makes you smile?	When she really wants something she does this cute little baby talk, and does a little dance when I agree to her request. Gets me every time :3	I go to sleep later then she does. 9/10 times she will be knocked out cold but as soon as I get into bed she rolls over and wraps around me. love it everytime.
All you extroverted, outgoing men (if you exist on reddit)...how do you feel about introverted women?	I want girls like you to come out, and not hide behind excuses like "but it's just the way I am" or "I don't feel ready". Being introverted is not inherently bad but it's stifling in many ways. It's limiting for yourself and doesn't provide much room to grow. You see those guys who are full of energy and enthusiasm, and part of you likes them because you admire those qualities. I want girls like you to realize that gaining that sort of outlook and energy is totally doable and not hard at all. I want you to be the best, most vibrant version of yourself. I don't want to "change you" or "turn you into something you're not", I just want *more of you* because people who start out as introverts are nearly always more interesting at their cores. Ex-introverts become the best extroverts!!	Being an introvert doesn't necessarily mean being shy. It means that you need to be alone to recharge your batteries. I am an introvert but you can be sure that I have absolutely no problem being very talkative, throwing jokes every two minutes, and chatting up people I don't know when I'm invited at a party full of people. However, I can't do that every day of the week and I will need to come back to my house to watch a movie, play a video game, or play guitar to recharge my batteries. Also, the world isn't a video game with two teams: Introverts Vs Extroverts. Most people are in the between, and while we always lean on a side, we tend to evolve as we mature and go out of our comfort zone.
Former sorority sisters, what were your best/worst experiences and how do you feel about Greek life now?	I don't understand sororities. College is (most of the time) an education that you are paying for, not a social life. I read things about these groups, and it just comes across as people that either want to bully people, or form a imaginary cast system so they can have a reason to look down upon people. I am interested for anyone in their 30's to respond on their post sorority life.	Based on my experiences, Best: you meet a lot of people. Like, a lot. The parties throw together a bunch of drunk underaged people who want to be friends with everyone. Which leads to to... Worst: Fast friendships tend to be superficial. You make friends quickly and lose them easily. So, it's a lot of fun, just be careful about who you invest your trust in.
Women who have given their numbers to strangers they found attractive, how did you do it and how did it pan out?	I’ve given two dudes my number. Neither called. But in all fairness, one told me he had a girlfriend and I gave it to him anyways.	I found them on dating apps, work, or going out.sometimes it panned out to just sex and ghosting, one time it panned out to be a long term relationship and another time a one night stand panned out to be chlamydia. So yeah, life’s a gamble.
What is it about women that baffles you the most (if anything)?	They spend hours every day trying to make themselves more attractive, and then get offended when you're attracted to them.	My mother always told me that it is impolite to go through a woman's bag. Every chick I ever dated asked me to go through her bag to find something. All these bitches trying to get me in trouble with my mom.
If you could add a rule to this subreddit without issue, what would you add?	Ban questions about relationships such as "I think my girlfriend has been seduced by untold horrors of the deep" or "My wife gave birth to twins, and one of them is an invisible abomination that defies all known laws of this earth, what do I do?" We're all tired of seeing the same questions asked every week.	If you do not post a comment when you downvote, your name will appear when one hovers over the downvote count. Just because I think it is incredibly silly for people to downvote others for giving the "wrong" answer to an open question. ("What's your favorite color?" "Blue. No green! Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh........")
Do you enjoy just the presence of your SO while you are doing work?	I absolutely hate being around my SO. They are immature, irritating, interactive, and unsymapthetic to my needs. I cannot relocate my computer because they will complain that I no longer love them, and I can't go to the library because they want to come too. Clingy SO is clingy.	Yes, a thousand times yes. Work can sometimes be frustrating, so being able to look up and see him there cheers me up immensely and helps me continue. He hates working when I'm there, though. He finds my presence very distracting... not because I'm being obtrusive, but because he keeps remembering the more fun things he could be doing at the moment.
Why is the ______ that you make the best _____ in the world?	nothing, I'm not quite that big of an egomaniac and I've worked with professional cooks since I was 15, no matter what it is there's some 65 year old somewhere who's been making that one dish since he was 12. That bit of pedanticism aside I make bomb ass food across the board thanks to the whole working with much better cooks since I was 15, my best stuff is probably fresh pasta. Raviolis with a mix of ricotta parm and asiago with an egg yolk nested in the middle before covering with the second sheet, cooked up then covered with a light chicken garlic sauce with cream and tomatoes, a bit of butter... It's like the fattiest thing on earth but it's so goddamn decadent I love it. Also make really good chashu with applejuice, butter and star anise in addition to the usual japanese seasonings	The sex I make is the best sex in the world, because I've enjoyed it more than all of the sex that I didn't make.
Is having a friend over and playing video games for the night childish?	What's "staying up all night" mean? Staying up until 4am is kinda immature in a way I suppose, because don't you have stuff to do the next day? Otherwise: I'm a young professional woman and I played like 3 hours of video games today so KEEP FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. Your girlfriend sounds like a bit of a drag.	>"When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up." -C.S. Lewis
What's everybody buying their SO for Christmas??	Eh, we don't really do Christmas gifts. Christmas is stressful and terrible enough without having to add another dimension to it. Our gifts to each other are trying to save one another from stress!	I'm a HUGE reader, but my boyfriend really isn't too into reading. But we're LDR, and whenever we visit each other he loves to listen to me read out loud, so I've slowly been introducing him to all my favorite books. For Christmas, I've been making a few audiobooks by recording myself reading, for him to listen to while we're apart! A super cheap gift, but I've been investing a lot of time, and I hope it's going to mean a lot to him :)
Women that cut their hair drastically (think pixie cut after long/medium length hair) what is your experience? Did you like it or regret it? Did it impact how others saw you?	I've done this a few times. My first ex pitched a fit but besides that, I've always gotten positive reactions, even when I didn't like thr haircut myself! I've found that I love all sorts of short bobs but an actual pixie cut brings out my Indian/Jewish nose too much haha.	I LOVED it! My husband was also 100% about it and loved that I didn’t suffocate him anymore when we were snuggling! However, every other man in my life felt the need to tell me how they could never be with a girl that had short hair like mine and that got old real quick!!!
Moms and daughters of reddit, whats your best ''Don't tell dad moment''?	As a husband and father, reading some of these would make me really sad to know if this was my wife and daughter.	My mother and I once stopped by my dad's favourite cupcake shop, but they only had two left. We ate them and never mentioned it.
Let’s do some awareness. People with chronic/invisible illnesses, what do a typical good day and bad day look like for you?	I am autistic, and have issues with my anxiety and depression. A average good day for me is I wake up, interact with siblings, stay awake after they leave, do chores, maybe do some writing if I'm not going through writers block, indulge special interest, talk to friends and family, and some stimming. A bad day for me is when it's hard to wake up, I don't want to interact with my siblings or might even snap at them which makes me feel worse, want to take naps but I can't, have to be pushed to do chores, writing is really hard, special interest can't hold my attention, and talking to people is incredibly hard, even if I know that talking about it does help me.	I have rheumatoid arthritis. On a good day I have some stiffness in the morning but otherwise I can function fine, and handle my physical job fine- sometimes I need a nap after work since with RA comes fatigue, but not always. Bad days I'm bedridden for several hours after waking up due to stiffness and pain, and have heavy fatigue and have to nap several times during the day- on the worst days I also experience chest pain, dry eyes, and headaches. I have no choice but to call out of work those days, and even just doing that simple thing hurts a lot.
What kind of condoms should a woman buy just in case of a hook-up?	You might need to buy multiple kinds. As you know not every dick is the same size. I can ONLY buy magnums. All other types actually cause severe pain.	As long as you're not buying condoms that are specifically for either big or small dicks, they should be fine for the majority of men. If a dude has a huge dick and doesn't bring enough with him, then that sucks for him.
What's the most hurtful thing a loved one has said or done to you recently and how are you dealing with it?	"Your life isn't harder than anyone else's, be glad you're at least healthy" Half an hour ago by my mom. Sure, I have to take 5 different meds every day and probably for the rest of my life, enduring all their nasty side effects, or I'll go back to self-violence and trying suicide again. But sure, Mom, I'm *super* healthy and just being dramatic. Sounds petty but it's hurting.	"Honestly, we're all just kind of sitting here waiting for you to die so our lives will be easier and calmer" -my dad when I was 16 in treatment
Men of color, what life experiences made you realize your race was going to be an issue when it comes to dating and meeting women?	i didn't notice all this problem and I am not a white dude. Maybe because I do not care about girls who do not care about me.... So far I had relationship with two white girls and one asian. Honestly....you will find it amazing how it works if you can configure your body language correctly. Anyway, play the courting game differently if you are not white is all I can say.	Because white and Asian women have told me to my face "I don't date black guys." White fathers have warned me away from their daughters. Dated a Pakistani woman for two years, still couldn't meet her family for fear of her being cut off (they paid for her college). An Israeli girl told me she wouldn't dance with me because I'm black. And this is coming from a dude who isn't ugly, who is educated, who has a good job and isn't socially awkward at all. That being said, I have gotten with a couple white girls in the past. And I saw white girls getting with the athletes at my school all the time. So maybe white girls will make those exceptions occasionally, idk. Wouldn't date a white girl now, but I'm probably biased. **TL;DR: They told me.**
Ladies, what do you think of Hillary Clinton?	Just so everyone is aware, we know this is asked a lot, but the question is framed post-convention, which changes the context enough for it to be asked again.

Ladies who have vaginismus and other sexually hindering conditions, how does this effect your relationships?	A girl I dated a while back had this condition, and it was horrible. I myself tie emotions and sex in a way I've found few men do (at least from my own research) and so it was particularly rough on us. To the point after a few months we simply had to end the relationship over it. Granted, I was rather sexually inexperienced at the time, and we weren't sure how to handle it. But it's still a very difficult hurdle to work through.	I have vulvodynia, which basically means that I have pain down there for no reason. For me it made even just walking painful, and it was uncomfortable to wear tight clothing. Using tampons was torture, nevermind sex. Luckily for me my gyno prescribed me a med that got rid of 90% of the pain. It also seems to be related to my anxiety, as the higher my anxiety the more likely it is that the pain will flare up. I am able to have sex as long as we take it super slow, which is annoying, but luckily my boyfriend is patient.
If you wanted kids and your partner had a limited supply of sperm, would you be willing to go through an In Vitro Fertilization cycle to maximize your odds of conception?	Never. I am personally against IVF, and this applies to all reasons why a person would be contemplating it. There are so so many children in this world without parents, and if for whatever reason you are unable to have a child of your own but are so driven to become a parent to a child, I do not understand why adoption isn't first on people's minds. If I or my partner were unable to conceive of a child, this is the route we would be taking.	In vitro is actually really intensive on the mother. Drugs, invasive tests, all kinds of stuff, and it's very expensive. You're better off doing doctor assisted intrauterine insemination. There are ways to test ovulation to do the insemination at (ostensibly) the best time to potentially conceive. Or if you're wanting to play it fast and loose, you could get your goods from the storage place and do the deed at home in private. IVF should truly be a last resort. Lots of other options that will likely work and be significantly less invasive and expensive.
[Serious] Men, do you actually consider yourself attractive?	I could be worse looking, but I could also be better looking. We all have insecurities. When people have said I'm attractive in the past I've had some trouble believing it, but at the same time I realize I'm not awful to look at. edit: forgot a word.	Every now and then in the mirror I look at myself and then go, "Yeah, I'm pretty attractive." But the rest of the day I just completely feel like some fetid creature.
Grabbed from AskMen: Women, what moment do you look back on and can't believe how much of an idiot you were?	Starving myself in high school and freaking out about how I look constantly I barely wear makeup anymore and have definately on some weight (I used to have a BMI of 19-20 and now it's like 20-21). I can still sleep with pretty much whoever I want. Doing stuff because other people told me to do it. Or it "should be good" instead of thinking for myself. Having sex with guys because I was afraid they'd leave me or assault me if I didn't.	The fact that I chose to stay in America after graduating high school instead of taking the amazing opportunity to go to college in Scotland because I thought I was *~so in love~* with my boyfriend at the time and wanted to stay here with him. Yeah, that was stupid.
Heterosexual guys, how does it feel when your gf falls asleep on your chest?	I dont know ive nevwr had an girlfriend. The one time a girl i loved was laying against me and holding my arm was really fucking good bur thats all xd	It's cute but I like shifting around before I settle down to sleep. It's like a dog falling sleep on you, it's an honor but you can't move
What's something that you listen to your SO talk about but don't really care at all?	Almost everything. She's always spouting on about some trivial stuff about people at work or stuff in her game or a click bait article that she 'relates' to or how she looks after putting on make up or how she thinks she's fat when she could really use a few more pounds or does this shirt looks good with there jeans etc etc etc That thing about women having hundreds of internet explorer tabs open in their brain is no joke.	All the bitches she works with. "Every woman got a woman at work she hates. And it's always some Dynasty shit."------Chris Rock
Women who had their first relationship at 25+ years old what was it like?	First boyfriend at 23, he was one year younger than me, with him two years, it was nice but he was immature and it didn't last obviously. I often wonder if, had I had boyfriends earlier, in university say, would I have had more experience to be able to avoid the absolute arseholes I've been involved with in my later 20s since the first boyfriend?? I guess there's no point looking back and wondering because the past is gone.	My sister got her first boyfriend at 26, she's 28 now. She didn't choose singleness before that. She and her boyfriend are fully attached now, they can't be without texting each other a whole hour. They have a horrible relationship, one is controlling and the other has lost their personality for that. Things you don't know how to do because it's your first and you have no idea what relationships should be like.
Jumping off the "period shits" thread--Ladies, what are some body issues no one ever warned you about (and that men don't even know they don't know about)?	Thankfully for me, nothing odd has ever really happened to me. I don't have to worry about being regular, as I've been right on the dot since my first period. The only thing that no one warned me about was how damn horny I'd get the week before my period. >_<	My big one is that no one ever fully explained discharge to me. For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me because my underwear was always gross and crusty at the end of the day.
What subreddits have you been banned from?	r/movies for (correctly) arguing that the Disney Star Wars films are nothing but corporate cash cows r/StarWars for (correctly) arguing that the new characters are badly written and only exist to spout SJW talking points r/Battlefield and r/masseffect for arguing that EA's recent pivot to SJW has gutted both of these franchises r/TopMindsOfReddit because they just automatically ban people based on whatever. r/politics for having the audacity to support the Don and not sucking the dick of the Demoncrats r/AskReddit for calling someone a cuck (guess I deserved that one)	R/whatisthisthing because I suggested that something may be a ramp for people in wheelchairs. The mods thought it was a “mean joke” which made me sad because I was being totally genuine and thought it could be helpful for OP.
Ladies, what is the cringiest thing your SO has said to you in public? How did you react?	It wasn't something he said, but something he did. We were walking towards WalMart and soon as we reached the furthest end of the sidewalk... he SPIT on the sidewalk!? LIKE WHAT THE HECK. I immediately slapped his shoulder out of disgust. It was no hesitation.. We stopped right there and I was informing him you just don't do that. That isn't right. You do not spit anywhere in a public place, especially on a sidewalk.	My husband one time said to my very conservative friend and her husband, "My wife would make a good hooker." At that point I think he realized maybe he shouldn't have said that, so he decided to make everything better with, "Your wife would too." Edit: Wanted to add, I think he was trying and failing to tell me he thought I looked good that evening. Then thinking that it wasn't what he said that made everything awkward but the fact he hadn't also complimented my friend, he extended his kindness to her. My friend has never let me forget that moment. Needless to say, that was the first and last time we went out as couples.
Women who regret having children, why?	My 6 year old just yelled down the stairs at us that his older brother (9) is being mean because he's not letting him snore. My eyes met my husband's and I read him the question, he thought y'all should know. I always wanted kids, I couldn't wait to have my own babies. I love my kids and go the extra mile for them. My eldest has been on probation. I'm raising my crazy sister's teen daughter in addition to my 5 biological kids. Boys eat and break things. Girls hibernate and have attitude. Sometimes, I threaten them with abortion. /s kind of.	I don’t regret having kids but I do dream about that elusive world wherein I had my current resources and wasn’t tied down by motherly duties. I have a great career and I make good money, but my husband an I live in another country than our family which implies that we don’t have much support if we ever want to take a break. Yeah we can hire a babysitter every now and then for a date night but the thought of even taking a weekend trip together is laughable. We are so prudent about our vacation days as kids fall sick or school holidays etc and we often have to save time off for such exigencies. I haven’t ever spent a night without my kids and even the thought of it exhausts me.
What advice would you give your daughter for avoiding players, liars, cheaters?	Why couldn't she be notching her own belt? I have no problems with my female relatives enjoying sex and pursuing it. That's a healthy attitude.	If he's a jerk to other people, but nice to you it's not because you are special and can change him. It's because he's a jerk who wants in your pants. He'll go back to being a jerk after he gets that.
Do people ever believe you're a certain type of person when you really aren't?	I come off as an annoying prick with a low tolerance for stupidity. In reality, I'm a bit of an annoying prick with a low tolerance for stupidity... But I love helping people. Come to me with a problem, I'll do my damndest to help you with a smile on my face.	People think I am incredibly intelligent. I am not. I was smart in school and I know a lot of trivia, so I gained a reputation of "Lockjaw knows everything" and that anyone could ask me anything and get a good answer. If they ever saw me at university, they would see that I am not at all above average. A lot of people also excuse any mistake I make by attributing it to the "crazy" part of the "crazy genius" picture they have of me. It's not easy getting rid of an image like that, and I have to admit that I have played into it at times where it was beneficient to me.
What are you old fashioned about?	If a girl takes you home the first night you meet her, she is not the girl to take home to your mother. Right or wrong, i dont know or care. But what i do know is that my wife made me work for it and we are still going strong 11 years later.	I have sex with a girl only if she is officially my girlfriend, and we have agreed to an exclusive and committed relationship with each other. I have never been into casual sex and hookups. Intimacy just doesn't feel right to me when it's with someone who I don't love; I've made out with girls who I was not in a relationship with and while that was enjoyable, something in the back of my head told me to not go further than that.
What's a product for women you wish existed?	**ITT**: products that do exist; but people just didn't know that they existed, didn't look for them, or couldn't find them. There aught to be a subreddit dedicated to such products full of links to where they can be purchased. Maybe there already is. I wouldn't know. Didn't look.	A device that just sucks your period out of your body. I would love to have it over in a minute
Divorced mom making my father's life difficult every way she can now that he has a girlfriend. What can I do to help calm her down?	Stay out of it - it's between your mum and your dad. They've already got a divorce and it's their business. If it makes you feel uncomfortable that she talks about it, either tell her, ignore it or leave, but don't involve yourself directly or defend one to the other - really good way to piss everyone off and end up in a world of shit.	Honestly I would talk with your mom about seeing a therapist if she isn't yet. Sounds like she has a lot of personal problems and is taking them out on everyone else instead of dealing with them.
Autistic men of Reddit, what is something you don't understand about neurotypical people?	Omfg x is upsetting my wife. Clear solution is to fix/stop y. I suggest this. She is pissed because she wants support and this isnt support. Drives me up a wall. We get in big fights about stupid shit and I literally have no idea what the issue is.	My brother is autistic and your first two examples infuriate him. He’s gotten better over the years but I’m not sure this is a autistic/neurotypical issue but just a person to person issue.
Is your boyfriend/husband beautiful even without makeup and in what way?	OP, in the future please make sure that your question is inclusive of all genders and sexualities. For example, you could have used something like significant other or partner instead of a gendered term. Everyone else, please feel free to respond based on the gender of partners you prefer.

What is the riskiest wank you've ever had?	On a public transit light rail train. I was late and there were only a few people on it, but I had it all out of my pants. Young me was a mix of ballsy and really stupid.	Jerking off inside a filthy port-a-potty, in Balad, Iraq, to an AAFES catalog, in 130 degree heat, during a mortar attack. I was a horny, sex deprived 19 year-old and thought my scrotum was going to explode if I didn't bust a nut. Mission accomplished.
What's the female equivalent of "being a gentleman" when dating?	A lot of this doesn't sound "gentlemenly" to me, it more sounds patronising or mollycoddling...especially the offering to pay for everything...what year is this? Why are you impressed by a man offering you money? Buy your own dessert :) I think a better conversation is around "kindness"	Being kind, attentive, and not expecting to be treated like a princess from the start. A date shouldn't be the guy doing all the work, especially if he was the one to put himself out there by asking her out first. Being willing to pay for herself, offering date ideas (this can be stressful for a lot of guys), and contributing to conversation are all nice too.
What do people say is "no big deal", but isn't "no big deal"?	Using animals for food. It's super bad for our health. Not because we'll get fat, but because factory farms are breeding grounds for super-bacteria which are growing to be a very real threat. It's also an inefficient use of land, so we're destroying landscape and ground water. Methane release from cow-productions are a significant contribution to greenhouse gasses. On top of that, of course, all modern scalable facilities cause animals to suffer by any measure of suffering. Tbh I'm getting tired of getting the "no big deal" from meat-eaters at lunch or at dinner parties. Our culture has evolved on so many issues, and its time to evolve on this one too.	When you're late. It's no big deal the first time but if it happens consistently it's very annoying, especially if you don't give me a heads up that you're going to be late.
How have you come to terms with having to text everyone first to have a conversation, knowing you're not anyone's go-to person to talk to?	This is a silly mentality, and I do not share it. If you want to be there for people when they need help, help them before they need to ask it. One shouldn’t feel bad about not being texted first this is the age where ghosting is basically socially acceptable.	I kind of keep myself busy and focus on myself so I don’t need to text other people. When I need to talk to them, I message them; otherwise I just keep to myself and do me.
I'm a man who never approaches women because I don't want to seem like I just want to get them in to bed. What says to you that a man is just being friendly and not looking for something more?	Why are you bending over backwards just so that no random woman thinks you're trying to get laid? (Nothing wrong with that by the way). Just be your self and if that's "creepy" to her, move along and talk to someone more deserving of your time	I have had many rewarding and interesting conversations with men I don't know, and the thing that all of those conversations have in common is that the guy never brought up my appearance or complimented me on something physical. In a museum, taking about the artists in the current exhibit; at a fundraising event talking about why we were there and why it was important; in a particularly long queue, talking about the weather and how ski season should be coming up soon, and hey! wouldn't you know we both snowboard. Those are all examples of recent conversations I've had with men I didn't know that have been pleasant and didn't trigger the feeling that I was being sussed out as a sex partner.
What are the top five best decisions you ever made?	1. Joining rugby 2. Joining rugby 3. Joining rugby 4. Joining rugby 5. Joining rugby Everything else good in my life stems from that one decision. Friends, etc.	1. Getting out of the cesspool that was the part of nyc they dont show you on tv. 2. Moving to another country on a whim 3. Saying no to drugs 4. Being there for my friends 5. Buying a brand new mattress with my savings.
It’s sexual assault awareness month. Men who have been groped, grabbed, and or have been forced into sex by a woman or another man, what’s your story?	I get the forced/manipulative sex part, but is it really so bad to get momentarily groped/grabbed out at rowdy public venues? It's happened to me on occasion and I couldn't give less of a shit, if someone tried to press the issue and keep doing it then that's a problem but otherwise whatever. Life is too short to arbitrarily consider yourself a victim over trivial things. I don't like how that gets grouped in with rape by a lot of activists, really understates the severity of it.	I went out to a bar with a friend once and we met a couple of cute girls. We start chatting them up and next thing I know, I'm at home in bed (alone) with no idea how I got there. My truck was in the driveway and I can only recall having a couple of beers. I check my phone and one of the girls from the night before has been added to my phone and my facebook. I check my bank account and I did pay the bar tab (which was considerably more than just a couple of beers), then apparently for dinner at a diner nearby. I called my friend and he had no idea what had happened either and we never heard from those girls again. I'm not sure what all happened but I know I could not consent to anything that night.
What is the weirdest thing you do in the name of saving money?	maximise expensing things to my company. If I'm far enough from my hometown, I just switch to my company business card and let the company pay. For instance, if I'm at the service station on the motorway I'll grab something for dinner and just expense it to the company. But I could have just been on my way to/from the mall.	I dye my clothes when they start looking too worn. I don’t own many white clothes, because bleach breaks down the fabric.
Is being with two women at once really a universal fantasy for men?	No. First, gay and asexual men exist. Second, do straight and bisexual men who balk at the logistics of actually sleeping with two women at once. And so do monogamous men. And every other variation you can think of that would turn down a threesome.	If I was a guy reading that I'd think IT'S A TRAP! I'd be worried about waking up in a bathtub filled with blood, missing a kidney...
Men who are engaged or married, what was the moment that made you realize: I want to make this woman my wife?	play video game with me even though she isn't very good, takes and interest in my hobbies that she's isn't to interested in and I do the same for her. Edit plus she is pretty tight ;)	When I was dying, before I knew I was going to recover, my now wife worked 3 jobs, but still managed to spend 5-6 hours a day with me, even if it meant she was passed out on the uncomfortable hospital chairs to be near me. She spent so much time there that the nurses grabbed a convertible chair/bed for her so she could at least have some kind of sleep.
What are the red flags to look out for in a friendship?	Emotionally unstable people. The ones who from 0 to 60 in anger and will get in screaming matches. Yikes. And also the ones who become your "best friend" immediately after meeting them. It seems pretty disingenuous and means they've probably cycled through other "best friends" before you. Usually the people who complain about being surrounded by drama start it themselves.	If you feel emotionally drained each time you talk to someone, something isn't going well. I also don't like friends that you only get to see when they're single. Especially if those periods consist of comforting them over the break-up, obsessing over everything a new guy said/did, until that new guy is the bf and the 'friend' is gone again.
Why doesn't the constant urge to have sex go away?	Unfortunately it doesn't and it can get worse. My wife got a breast reduction 3 years ago and I went into non-stop attracted to other women mode which has completely derailed me. Distracted doesn't even come close.	Old man reporting in. At 50+ my libido has finally started to taper off just enough so that sex isn't constantly on my mind. Thank fucking God...
do you have any double standards in your relationships that are willing to admit to?	Tons. I'm okay with "admitting" them because I don't think that it's anything to hide - both my husband and I are okay with, and cherish, the fact that men and women are innately different and, as such, there will be different standards for either of us. Not everyone wants to be the same as their partner, so, for us, double standards aren't a bad thing	When she's taking care of the kids, she's "Working taking care of the boys." When I take care of the kids, I'm "Out having fun with the boys."
Ladies who dated in high school, what was your experience? What would you say to high school students who are in/want to be in relationships?	Don't date in high school. Focus your energy on having FUN, new experiences, learning skills, and cultivating solid friendships (and planning your future!) If you decide to date, choose someone who shares your interests and have fun together. If you find yourself bogged down in emotional quagmires and fights, GTFO (by clearly and kindly telling the person it's over, not ghosting or being passive aggressive. Practice the difficult parts of relationships with civility). Never ever be afraid to say NO to anything. It's not rude.	LPTs about dating: Only date guys who DO good things are ARE good natured. If he acts like an asshole, he is an asshole. Don’t make excuses for him like “I know he’s good inside” or “he could be such a great guy if...” Also, NEVER consider time in a relationship an investment. What I mean by this is, never say to yourself “but we’ve been together for one year and I don’t want to have to start over with someone else now.” Allow break ups to happen. At the time it may feel like you’ll never recover and that no one can understand what your going through, but you will, and most every person can understand and knows how hard a break up can feel. You are never alone.
What are your "I can't believe I was in that relationship" stories?	generally a weenie- avoided confrontation, hated cheesecake, loved cats (i'm a dog person), and was really close with somebody else but "she lived too far away so nothing would ever happen". Looking back on it I remember thinking "Do I even LIKE him?". The answer was no, but I stayed and I have nothing but regret because it kept me from doing things that I really wanted to do at that time in my life. And in the end he was a not nice guy.	Jesus. I was thinking about answering this question about this guy I dated for 2 years in college who ended up being a drug addict and was horrible to me. I googled him and just found his obituary. Shit.
How many of you guys like lounging about in just your underwear?	Like you...my belly isn't flat and my thighs tend to touch. But I'm comfortable with myself...not HAPPY with it, but accepting. As far as the tighty whities...meh, just what I wore today. I have better stuff from 2Xist and Jockey...but I also appreciate the basics.	Unless I have company over, I'm almost exclusively in my underwear. The only drawback is no pocket to toss my phone into when I walk around the house.
Ladies, did you fall in love with someone you weren't expecting?	Yeah, my bestfriend/FWB. We were/are great friends. But in relationship terms I (and he) did not think we were suited. We've been together 5 years now, and definitely.	Yeah. Met some guy from reddit for a hobby. Married him last month. Redditors: no creepier than regular people you'd meet IRL
Women of color, in what ways have you experienced racism from white women?	As the question is direct to women of color, please only leave a top-level answer if you are a woman of color. If you have meta-thoughts on this question being asked in the first place, save them, they aren't on topic. And to totally not racist people reporting this post, again you can save it, we're ignoring reports.

FAQ Friday: My SO has gained weight, what can I say to tactfully and respectfully bring this up with them?	Break up with her right away. She has shown that she has a genetic flaw, an inconsistent character and a lackadaisical attitude towards her health and the health of your relationship. You don't want to endure years of yo-yo weight issues.	First, get to the underlying cause. Gaining a "significant amount of weight" is something that should be looked into. Second, with the cause established, work with your SO on making whatever changes are required to bring them to a healthy weight.
Black ladies, how do you find men who are interested in serious relationships/marriage?	I go for the low hanging fruit. The men I go for are lonely, depressed, and just want to be loved. Also I only go for white guys. Also, I'm sorry, but the statistics aren't pretty, I'm going to have much better luck at life with a white guy than a black guy.	I met my fiance online. He is an South Asian man, so I was very surprised that he was still interested in me. He told me that he found black women very attractive as well as others. I was so surprised because every man before him made it clear they weren't attracted to black women or they didn't want anything serious with me. It was disheartening because I truely believed that I was ugly because of my race when I was younger. I'm lucky I found someone who appreciates me for me, but to answer your question...it's just hard out there.
How does one make their dream of leaving it all behind and living in a cottage in the forest a reality?	Downsides include no electricity or running water. No refrigeration, sewer/toilet system. No way to recharge phones, no internet to post to the cottage core instas.	I remind myself that I don't like people, but I do like modern amenities. I also don't like the outdoors. Now a giant library/fortress where I could be alone and read all day....that might work.
What is your biggest non-physical insecurity?	I lack a certain degree of warmth and social nuance and this can be off putting. It isn't uncommon for the least charitable interpretations of what I say to be favored if there is more than one way to interpret it, to extrapolate the complete opposite of what I actually meant. There is no fully coming back from being vilified, I am to some degree always a social leper. I am often left feeling like I am misinterpreting friendship for strained tolerance, and that I'm really viewed as irredeemable.	I worry that I'm boring. I'm not a super fun dance-y ball of sunshine exciting mysterious person like a lot of the women in my friend group are. I'm frightfully plain.
Guys, what encounter have you had with a woman which resulted in a "You're lucky you're hot" thought in mind?	Girls randomly grabbing my beard. That's my fucking face you cunt. But if you're good looking I'll probably let you away with it if I think you might get jigging with me later on	Pretty much every time I see a hot girl. It's a very lucky thing to be hot, and I'm totally envious. Edit: Apparently envy and jealousy are different things! I never knew that.
what is something that genuinely scares you?	that i kill myself 40+ hours a week just for the government to steal a 1/3 of it from me. that means i work at least 13.3 hours for nothing a week. i would rather have that time to myself.	Being unwanted, alone, abandoned. Not amounting to shit in life. Disappointing my family and myself. Basically failing in general. But like really failing. Only issue is i dont know what is consider true and utter failure.
What's your daily eye-candy moment?	This super pretty Latina girl at work. Yeah, she's too young for me and too pretty to be seen with this mutant.	I live in the foothills of the Texas hill country. I get [this](https://jefflynchdev.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/texas_hill_country_clouds_large.jpg) during the morning commute, and [this](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8519/8639407877_4a6075f39a_b.jpg) in the evening. I've been looking at that terrain since childhood, but it still never fails to make my day a bit better.
How do I lower my sex drive?	Stop watching porn and stop masturbating as much as possible. It'll be really hard at first, but as you ejaculate less, your body will respond by producing less semen, and your urges will become less frequent. Get yourself to a point where you can go 3-4 days before you need to release (the operative word being need). And, yeah, I think not feeling crazy for sex every single day probably will have an overall positive effect on your life. That said, every two weeks is not much...	Truth is that this could be a deal breaker. Can you imagine spending the next 5 years getting it twice a month? She's on the lower end of the spectrum. I think younger couples have sex at a minimum of 3 to 4 times per week. I don't want to sound callous but having libidos that match really is important in a relationship.
How do you deal with a girl choosing between two guys?	Meet up with her ex, level with him, realise she's a vacillating bitch who shops for boyfriends like she's shopping for cars, and go have a beer with your new mate.	In any relationship, romantic or not, don't make someone a priority in your life when they don't make you a priority in theirs.
Wonderful women of reddit, do you also enjoy "sniffing" your BF's male scent when cuddling or otherwise being physically close to him?	I'm the same way. His whole body smells amazing, but it's most concentrated in his chest, neck, and armpits. Looooove snuggling up into his chest hair when we're sleeping so I can just inhale his scent. :3	Yup. My SO's scent is both a crazy turn on and gives me a general feeling of comfort. I love it.
How can girls communicate why they're upset without making you feel guilty?	It's not really the same thing, but I get super annoyed when women make an observation about themselves like "I'm getting fat". Then as a guy you provide solutions. "Maybe you'd feel better by going to the gym", and somehow women turn that into "So you think I'm getting fat!!?" What? No. I'm just giving you solutions for your own insecurity.	I tend to hear SO's venting as if I should be fixing something. I know intellectually that's not true, but that is my emotional reaction. I work on it. Straightforward is still the best approach. If I get defensive, just remind me that you're sharing and venting, not blaming, not asking to fix. I need the reminder sometimes. I'm not perfect.
What’s the worst job interview that you ever had?	I was asked how did I hear about the job? Why do you wanna work here? I replied my friend works here!!! I guess that was really bad. Then I said it’s very convenient and practical. This wasn’t a CEO position I don’t understand why they thought me living close and having a friend who works there was such a bad thing!	Interviewed for a marketing job at a smaller company in oil and gas. I asked about company culture, how laid-back the office is, etc. The lady told me every two weeks, if their sales team meets the quotas, they get to wear jeans on Fridays. She looked at me and smiled and said, with 100% seriousness, "We have fun here." Did not get hired there and glad about it tbh.
What are some trivial things that you silently judge other men for?	A few others for me: * Not knowing the names Jimmy Page, Keith Richards, and David Gilmour * Not having seen Star Wars * Ordering steak cooked more than medium rare	Guys who are exclusively nice to girls. It's actually pretty comical when a douche completely changes his behavior as soon as a girl walks in the room and completely worships and white knights for her lol.
Anyone else struggle with the idea that they might be more attractive than they think?	Yes, I get told I look good. I just think people (mainly cashiers etc, non tip jobs) are being nice. More times than not I'm calling myself a dumbass because I was getting hit on.	Yes. I've been told by my parents, internet strangers, and married women 20 years older than me that I'm attractive, but no one in my age group. Mutual attraction is also something that I've never knowingly experienced, so I'm not sure who to believe.
Why do I keep falling for female friends?	It makes sense. A good relationship is one where you're friends and lovers. I don't think men and women are really meant to be, or capable of, being "just friends".	Have you ever been in a romantic relationship with a woman you loved? Because from what you say it seems like you're mistaking the love and bond friends share for romantic feelings and love a couple would share. It's two different types of companionship. I would recommend to you if you are interested in dating is to go find women who you are not friends with and take the time to date them and get to know them. You say you have never been attracted to someone you didn't know well, so take the time to get to know some girls. Start dating.
Men in their mid 20's or later without a degree (or not following it) and working low wage/unskilled work. How do you feel about this and your future prospects?	I'm a firm believer that you should like your job, instead of just thinking about it like it's a pay cheque. That being said, it doesn't mean I think everyone has a to have a white collar job! Do what you like and if its also rewarding career wise, go have a ball.	I work retail and am 30. I'm going to school in January. I have no debt and no kids and a super supportive s/o. I'm really excited.
Does anyone else take offense to all the "real women" conversations that get so much traction these days? Do we objectify ourselves?	Skinny shaming isn't that high on my list of concerns. Like.. obviously I don't support it, but it's really a drop in the ocean compared to what fat women face, so concern about it seems a bit hollow to me. Skinny is still the ideal, skinny women are still depicted all over the media as the perfect kind of woman, women are still starving themselves and developing EDs to be skinny.	It only bothers me in that I think it's stupid. We are all real women, we are all just different; thick, thin, no make-up, make-up, wrinkles, gray hair, colored hair, etc.
For women over fifty, what are your favorite beauty tips you've learned through the years?	I'm 36, happy, drink water religiously, eat healthy, not exercise much and smoke occasionally. I have a lot of improving to do!	My mom is 63 and looks 40. She has perfect skin, and people always ask what her secret is. She always says plenty of water, daily excersise, clean diet, sunscreen, and happy thoughts.
[NSFW] Men who were dumped because the sex was bad, how are y'all doing now?	After all this time I got my degree online from university of Phoenix. If this is serious then come on dude, your partner was the problem. Any way to get out of relationship they use excuses to turn you down and in the end you just blame yourself. You can't be bad at sex, maybe clumsy or dingy. Even inexperienced people have fun. Fuck whoever told you that, you get yours and eventually you find someone with the same sexual appetite and desires. If not keep looking The world is big and we're over populated there's someone for everyone	It crushed me for a long long time. I stopped going out, avoided talking to girls, neglected my hygiene.. Even when I got to be in a much better place emotionally, I wouldn't escalate anything sexual & would often talk my way *out* of sex at every turn. For me, the risk of it possibly happening again outweighed any personal need for sexual gratification. I'm all better now though :)
Ladies who mostly use pads during your period - why? And do your friends give you crap for it?	I find it funny how American women seem to be obsessed with tampons. I'm not American and I've always used pads coz the idea of having something stuck inside me all day long is not very pleasing.	I only use pads. I like pads more than tampons. I don't feel gross or feel like I am wearing a diaper. The only shit I get for being a pad user is actually from 2XC comments.
what are your thoughts on your SO wearing provocative clothing to a party that you aren't attending?	I have always liked it when girls I date dress more moderately with me. If they want to dress provocatively with their girlfriends, who am I to stop them? And honestly why do we as guys even care? Provocative clothing or not, if she is going to cheat she'll do it. If you can't trust her enough not to cheat, dump her ass.	There's something that doesn't sit right with me that I only see her at her best when she's headed out the door to mingle with other folks. Would you prefer more provocative dress when you go out with her, or less when she goes out without you? You might get the first one, pushing for the second is just going to make you look like an ass.
How does using a menstrual cup actually feel? Is it more convenient than pads or tampons? What are it's cons?	I like it, I have some leaking but overall way more convenient and comfortable. But you do have to get used to being in contact with all the blood, etc more. My sister still uses tampons because she doesn't like dealing with the blood, but I'd recommend trying out. I think they ever make disposable one's now (not so good for environment but might be cheaper for a test run).	If it's in correctly, you shouldn't be able to feel it at all. Like a tampon. I think it's more convenient than pads or tampons because you don't have to change it for 12 hours, instead of 8. It's also eco-friendly of course. For me, the cons are that sometimes I don't want to go through the hassle of putting it in/taking it out/cleaning it, so I'll just put a pad on. But for days when I'm out at work or just not home all day, it's super convenient.
What is the sweetest thing a SO has said to you?	"Ya know, you are my guardian angel, I just feel so free and a burden is off my chest". "I want to live forever and ever and ever with you babe". Inside joke-"you are my panda bear and I can hug you forever". "We just have the most insane connection ever". "After everything we went through its clear we were destined to be together". She's my ex, bitch... :/	"If I were ever going to shoot you, it'd just be in the leg." Brings a tear to my eye even today.
What decision have you instantly regretted?	Banging a fat chick at a party. I immediately realized what I had done. My friends still give me shit for it to this day. edit: It happened 4-5 years ago. Still get grief over it. Especially because the girl went from fat to insanely fat. I just try and forget....	In an interview. Interviewer: "Do you smoke?" Me: "Like cigarettes?" Instant fuck up. The tone of the interview completely changed after that.
What is the most humiliating thing a woman has done to you?	A girl in middle school did that pretended to be interested thing. I knew what was up though. I have had ex's do some crazy and underhanded shit, but not really humiliating outside of cheating.	One night she got pissed at me and went into great detail about how her ex was hung like a porn star and he hit all the right spots that my dick just couldn't touch and how she fantasized about him when we had sex etc etc. At that time I was very inexperienced and I was very insecure about myself sexually, so this did a number on me. I was totally devastated, she had confirmed every fear and insecurity I had about myself.
How do you guys make friends with women without having them assume you are trying to get into their pants?	Awfully arrogant of them, don't you think? Do you want arrogant people as friends? Sounds like they're doing you a favor and self-screening themselves.	I meet them through my friends and then we all hang out together in a group. If they see you treat them the same as you treat your guy friends, it tends to put them at ease.
OkCupid users: what are your profile pet peeves?	-"if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best"...people are capable of being evil as shit. I feel like this quote has been said by serial killers who are in relationships. -Saying that a man must be X height and in good shape...but then saying real men don't care about a womans weight/figure. -Bitterness toward dating. -No pics -Says that they are only looking for friends. Then contacts me and talks about dating.	"if you wanna know, just ask. ;)" ETA: "i don't like drama/no drama pls" = they cause a lot of drama.
what do you guys think of this not so famous Will smith quote?	Oh yeah. Will Smith's life has been such a struggle. Damn all those friends that didn't stick by him when he foolishly spent all his music money and was offered a chance in a fledgling NBC show.	The difference seems to me that the Will Smith quote is about his circumstances and not shitty parts of his personality.
My girlfriend has been friends with this guy since she was really young, he also has a girlfriend. He's visiting her for the weekend to hang out since they haven't in a while. Although I trust her, I can't help but feel really weird about it. You guys had similar experiences?	Whether it is legitimate friendship or not she is being inconsiderate of you in the choice to be alone with another man.	You can't control everything. At some point you have to believe that she will not leave the house just to find another guy. There's this cheater prevention mentality that I don't think is worth shit. If someone wants to cheat they'll cheat. You can try to be there all the time to prevent it but that will just push them away. She's with you now, so she's already made a decision to be with you and not someone else. You either trust that decision or you don't.
To women who are considered unattractive/"ugly" by others, how do you deal with the bad treatment that comes along with it from others?	I think that people can go screw themselves. I am not conventionally attractive by any means or what society says I should be. I find myself beautiful, my guy finds me beautiful so... does it really matter what anyone else thinks? Noooope.	In my experience, the worst (and best in some situations) thing about not being conventionally attractive is that I'm completely invisible. I don't get poor treatment from people because I'm not even acknowledged by them. As for how to deal, I comfort myself by knowing that lots of people would choose invisibility as a superpower, and I already have it!
What do you do for a living? And if you had to do something else, what would it be?	I'm a stripper and personally enjoy it. But I'm not a one trick pony, I have plans to move to the big apple and become powerful executive's secretary after I graduate collage	I am a medical biller. If I could be anything, I would be... A meteorologist... Or a marine biologist... Or an archaeologist... Or a billionaire.
How do you decide what to make for dinner, and why don't you just eat a bowl of cereal?	I don't eat cereal. If I do, I purge it. So, I don't eat it. I usually just snack. I hate cooking.	Cereal is a bowl of empty carbs that spikes your blood sugar, then leaves you feeling hungry again a few hours later. I keep a binder of copies of recipes I've tried and liked. I scrawl notes on them. When I don't know what to make, I flip through and pick something based on what I have in stock plus how much effort I feel like putting in. Every so often I try a new recipe to potentially add to the binder.
What message/lesson from Romantic Comedies do you think men should explicitly ignore?	That a man’s life is less valuable than a woman’s. There is an argument to be made about children. When it comes to men and women it is just not true. For example when the Titanic sank men and women should have followed the children onto lifeboats. Romantic comedies often key in on this idea.	Basically all of them. Don't threaten suicide (the notebook) don't stand outside with a radio (was that say anything?), don't break up another great relationship (the ugly truth) don't follow her, stalk her and learn what she likes to get her attention (every romcom ever). Basically do not do anything romcom
What was that one lie you gave your parents and surprisingly got way with while growing up?	A lot of things relating to my boyfriend when we are home for the summer. We have been together for a long time and my mom really likes him so she knows that "stuff" is happening but doesn't want to hear about it. My mom only asked for "plausible deniability" when it came to what we were doing; she wasn't opposed but she also just didn't want to know when and where we were doing it. We "watch" a lot of movies and she goes on a lot of veerrrrry long, loudly announced evening walks.	When I was like eleven or so creme de minte/sp was a taste I loved. So I would take a taste out of my parents seldom used liquor cabinet once in a while. Then at some point it was almost empty. What's a kid to do? Fill it up again with water. Never told them and they never asked. It was a very very pale green. I was in my late twenties at dinner with them when they asked if I would like an after dinner drink. Out comes the same bottle 3/4s gone. I honestly lost it laughing. Had to come clean and ask them if their dinner invitations were ever reciprocated. Lesson learned teetotaler parents are easily fooled.
What's with the negative stigma around being uncircumcised in America?	>For clarity, I myself am not trying to campaign for anti-circumcision. Well you should be. It's borderline child abuse... just like corporal punishment, it's that same gray area.	I just don't understand the hygiene reasoning for circumcision. Most people shower or clean themselves at least every other day and it's not even hard to just pull it back and rinse the fucker. I've never had any problems with my penile hygiene and I haven't even been able to fully retract my foreskin until recently because of a medical problem.
At what point in a relationship/what age would you let your daughter start birth control?	I would prefer she use condoms. Birth control pills have a lot of terrible side effects. If She insisted she wanted the pill 15.	Whenever they needed/wanted it. If my kid trusts me enough to come to me with that, I'm not going to say no. Teenagers are going to have sex whether or not you want them to so I might as well let them be as safe as possible.
How private do you keep your relationship?	No, that's weird. While I never understood keeping relationship a secret, I at least can see maybe at the beginning where you aren't sure if dating is a relationship yet. But, if you have been together going on 5 years, it's well beyond time to make it public. I don't ever agree with the "lets keep this a secret because it's no one's business" mentality because it feels like you aren't proud of your partner. How can you have a healthy, functioning relationship if you are concerned with what people think of you two together. Seriously, fuck all that. Love me, love me publicly.	I don't make an effort to hide a gf, but I am a very private guy. I'll tell people we're together but I won't discuss anything about the relationship and hate being questioned about it. It's noones business but our own.
Your SO wants to ask your father's permission before you get engaged. Archaic or respectful?	Respectful!! My (ex)husband asked my father and then my grandfather... My father's response was "You know she's a pain in the ass?" Ahh, thanks Dad	Blessing good, permission bad. I want to be with someone who values family and sees himself becoming a part of mine, but can also make his own choices and realizes that we're starting our own family.
Has a gay guy ever been sexist towards you? And how?	Yes! I went to a gay bar for my 27th birthday because it's something I've always wanted to do. Had the time of my life! Went to the bar to order a drink and a gay guy came right beside me, spoke to the bartender, and said "oh I've got her drink! She'll have a sex on a beach! Did I guess that right?!" NO! Not every girl enjoys cocktails...I just wanted a beer. To me, this was pretty sexist. He did apologize and gave me a hug, so it wasn't a big deal. But that's the only time I can think of.	I worked with a guy that said many fatphobic things (like literally saying fat people are bad people) and that gay men cannot sexually harass women because they are gay. He said he could go up to a woman and grope her and it would not count as sexual harassment. I was told to accept his comments because “it’s different in the gay community.”
27 and having a double mastectomy due to cancer. Ladies with implant reconstruction, what can I expect that they don't tell you in the leaflets?	Good luck, and best wishes to you! It's a hard and brave thing. If you smoke, please stop now. One of the BEST things you can do to help your own healing and decrease the risk of complications with any sort of reconstruction (including expanders, flaps, or implants!) is to NOT SMOKE or use any nicotine/tobacco products.	It's probably radical of me, but if I had breast cancer and it was only in one breast, I'd probably opt for double too. Lower risk of recurring cancer, right? Best wishes, you'll be all right though! I was directing that towards the plastic surgery part. ;-) I've never had implants, but I do think that if you request the same cup size as before or smaller, it would probs be gentler on what remains of the breast tissue/muscle. As for nipples, they do very convincing tattoos of them nowadays. Good luck! Hugs to you.
Are Male Teachers Sexual Eunuchs?	Obviously exceptions are going to exist, all my male teachers were married growing up. However, it's definitely true there are professions that women see as sexy (doctor for example) and those they find generally unsexy (nurse as another example). I don't think it's a coincidence that the professions women find sexy tend to come with a lot of power and prestige. If that is what motivates you to do a career, I suggest you consider that when making a career choice, because again while it isn't an inherent deal breaker it won't make things easier on you.	Your friend is talking out her ass. Think about it, you're going into an industry where *there are more women than men* and you think that puts you at a disadvantage meeting women? How does that even slightly begin to make sense? I can't imagine a scenario where years later in your life you'd look back at that time you traded your dreams for a soul crushing job just because you thought it'd get you more pussy and then patted yourself on the back. That whole idea is crazy.
What's the most outrageous question you've ever been asked due to your gender?	My boyfriend and I were out to dinner with another couple. Boyfriend and I split our bill evenly. Female friend says: "why are you splitting it? He makes more than you, he should pay for everything".	"Gosh, you're in your late 20s already...Don't you worry about getting older? Women don't age as well as men." This from a guy who smoked a pack a day, tanned to the point of leather-y skin, and took no care of his body at all. Fuck. Right. Off.
Why is there a big push for women to be in STEM fields but not for more blue collar options?	feminists want more women in easy, inside, air conditioned office jobs making lots of money. Thy see outside, hot, manual labor physically demanding jobs as beneath women. Cause men.	In general we tend not to push anyone towards blue collar work. This is slowly changing with the whole unemployed college graduate with a lot of debt thing, but for the most part people are pushed to do white collar jobs.
What is an instant turn off for you?	Hey folks. I'm so very sorry if you find a particular turn-off in here that you don't like or you feel applies to you. Though honestly, the sooner you find out *not every single person wants to date you*, the better off you'll be. Please do not invalidate the people answering the question. Edit: Thread locked for repeated examples of invalidation and derailing.	Hey folks. I'm so very sorry if you find a particular turn-off in here that you don't like or you feel applies to you.

Have you witnessed or been a part of a random act of kindness or pay it forward type of situation and what was the experience?	A guys credit card was refused when he was trying to pay for his car tags. He came up $0.75 short on cash. I gave him a dollar. Can't tell you how many times I've given gasoline to strangers to get the to town after they run out in front of my house. I always refuse to take money, telling them to pay it forward.	I was at a Bernie Sanders rally a few months ago. It was super crowded and the media/tripods/cameras were obstructing a lot of views, but I could still see him. I heard an older couple next to me complaining they couldn't see him, so I offered to switch places with them so they could get a look. Reluctantly, they agreed. After about 10 minutes, they switched places with another person who couldn't see, who switched places with another person. It was pretty cool. edit: spelling
Does anyone else masturbate with cloth covering your business?	> The only way she can do her business is to put some type of cloth over her clit and rub it down to O-land. Is that the only way she can get off? :rolleyes: What about you *doing* that? :D :P	OH. I was like "what the fuck, that's a thing?!" until I realized that my lip (it's a rather generous one, sorry for the TMI) acts as a cloth for me, haha. If I didn't have my trusty lip, I don't think I'd be able to get off without some kind of... cloth, I guess. That would be waaaay too sensitive.
What stereotype about your group do you wish didn't exist?	I'm a geek (socially awkward) and nerd (like nerdy things). Like hardcore "I play Starcraft in my freetime and I'm majoring in computer science and engineering" nerd/geek. I don't really hate women. I *hate* with a passion 'gamergate' (A WOMAN DID SOMETHING WE MUST RALLY AGAINST HER) and I'm not a brocialist (I'm actually a far far person). I understand *why* the stereotypes exist. And if someone doesn't like me because of those stereotypes I kind of get it because...most 'gamers' are like that.	The Hair Length Theorem: 1. The longer a girl's hair is to her waist, the dumber she is. 2. The shorter a girl's hair is to her scalp, the more of a lesbian, feminazi ball-buster she is.
Men, what is the dumbest thing you did that you couldn't even tell your significant other in fear of relentlessly being made fun of for?	I'm in the process of doing one of the dumbest things ever right now. It's actually a long string of small things for someone. There is no SO to tell, and if this really isn't as stupid as I think it is, then she'll know regardless of if I tell her. If it is stupid, well, I don't expect to have an SO to tell anyways.	I once got so drunk that I ran away from my friends, and didn't show up again until 8am next day. It was in an unknown city, 3 days before new year's. I woke up sleeping under the stairs of the INSIDE of some house, with some lady asking me to please wake up and leave her house as she poked me with a broom handle. I got up, apologised, asked her to please call me a cab, and got out. But I've told several people this story because it's just funny now. I'm rather certain I have no secrets. Specially none that I'm ashamed of so much as to not own up to it and realise it happened and it was a learning experience.
Stolen from r/askwomen. When did you realise you were wrong about a big issue? When did you realise it?	Anime and Manga.I used to respect it as an art form but nowadays half of them are borderline child pornography. The people who draw the girls are not right in the head.	I didn’t believe in gay rights due to being in private school during my early years. I realized how wrong I was when I figured out I was gay during high school.
If your "one year ago self" met "current self," how would she feel?	Annoyed/disappointed that I've done nothing with my year. It feels like 365 have just flown by and I've nothing to show for it. Although I started making candles in October and I wanna buy a saxophone next year so hopefully next year will be better. And I'll shift some weight.	She’d be happy. I’m down 35 lbs, I’ve got answers to my medical issues and on a treatment plan with a great medical team, and I am more focused on my myself than ever. Although I’d warn her that her Christmas is about to be shit so she should prepare herself for battle.
Women who had non-traditional weddings: how much pushback did you get from friends and family? What was the worst?	My aunt got married by someone who was ordained on the Internet. With my father, a qualified and educated minister licensed to officiate weddings in all 50 states, sitting in the audience. He took it as a huge slap in the face not just to him but to his profession too.	My husband I eloped with our best friends at a castle. We already had a kid, a house, the whole 9, and didn't want to shell out for a huge wedding (his side is basically My Big Fat Greek Wedding so his guest list would start at 120, just "immediate family"). And we wanted were some nice pics, you know? His side was annoyed..."why didn't you do it at the church?" "What about having a reception?" Can't you get remarried at Fancy Country Club?"...and we'd say back, "Sure Aunt Bertha! Thanks for offering to pay!" They shut them up fast lol. But after a few weeks it all calmed down and no one cares about it. Except my MiL, but she's a monster.
Hey guys, I'm old, so when did the "friendzone" change into what it is now?	some feminists weaponized it a few years ago, so now if you say friendzone, they'll act like you expect sex for being nice.	It has always had multiple meanings since I became aware of the concept in the late 90s/early 00s. The initial "proper" meaning was when a woman uses a friend as an almost boyfriend but wouldn't actually date them. See also Ladder Theory.
What do you do if you realize another woman triying to steal your boyfriend?	I went through this recently. My girlfriend got insanely jealous over a girl I had zero interest in. It was too much. I broke up with her. You have to play it cool. It's okay to be jealous. It's not okay to act jealous.	Chill out and watch her make an idiot of herself. (I don't "protect" my guy from other women. He's either with me or he isn't.)
(x-post from r/AskWomen) When you first met your SO, were you instantly attracted to them, or did it just develop over time? How do relationships normally happen?	I noticed they were easy on the eyes from the get-go, but I've only seen a woman and thought "I must have her," in cases where it didn't work out, so, y'know. Usually I crystallize on wanting to date a woman after I've gotten to know her a little bit. For me, "normal" is knowing a woman as an acquaintance for a few weeks or months and then deciding that she seems cool and asking her out and her apparently having been eye-fucking me since we met or thereabouts. Or getting asked out by her.	Bam. Like a live wire. Halloween at college, eye on a girl, gave up when she was clearly after another guy, sat down with the big group at a movie and found this cute brunette sitting next to me. Put my arm around her (unusual for me) and she cuddled right up. Asked her out that week, great time on the date, leaned across the car for a good night kiss and it was like parts of my brain I'd never used before lit up. Engaged by Valentine's Day, married inside the year. Just celebrated our 34th anniversary. The wattage hasn't dimmed one bit.
Why did men start wearing more conservative ties after the 90s?	September 11, 2001. After the towers fell, America became a much more serious place. The tone of movies and TV drastically changed. The terrorists in movies went from Russian to Middle Eastern. And men's fashion got a little bit more serious too, especially in the business world.	Wearing suits became something that's only done in conservative settings: Finance, banking, lawyers, and formal parties. Everything else went "business causal". The late 80s/early 90s felt to me like a start to that: People were wearing flamboyant ties as a way of being more relaxed about wearing a tie. In the end, this was replaced by not wearing a tie at all. As a side note, wearing ties was fairly common in settings where you'd never see them today. When I look at pictures from when I was a kid (1970s), my father was wearing a tie in everyday settings at home, with only his wife and kids present.
How many of you enjoy snuggling after sex?	We like to cuddle immediately after sex for a little while, then I wipe the cum up, and then we go back to cuddling! EDIT: I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how this could have possibly upset anyone, let alone two people. Explanation, please?	We get up to clean ourselves off, use the bathroom, put the bed back where it's supposed to be (it's on wheels and our floor is slightly angled so we often end up a foot away from the wall), fix the sheets, have a drink of water, etc... Then cuddle.
Ladies that live/lived with a man who didn't do any housework, how do/did you cope?	I make him earn all the money, while I stay home and run the household? It's called traditional division of labor, it's not new or weird.	Lived with 3 guys in college. All expected me to pick up after them and refused to help. One day, I called a house meeting. I told them it was unfair and I wasn’t their mother. Then I gave them each an itemized bill for my cleaning service. I said I’d be glad to clean provided they pay the weekly charge. They started pulling their weight after that.
why is twerking supposed to be sexy?	I find twerking to be vulgar, not sexy. Eastern dance and bellydance (like Shakira) is super sexy and requires much more effort than just shaking your ass.	I used to be like you. Then my wife jokingly did it in front of me naked. It drove me bananas.
Do you prefer lingerie to nudity? What would you think if a woman preferred to keep her lingerie on, during sex?	Lingerie basically does nothing for me. Once we get to the point of taking off our clothes, I'm ready to go. What, am I supposed to stop and just like... look at her or something? Bitch, take that uncomfortable shit off and come sit on my face. You got cumming to do.	Sex part definitely naked. Beforehand lingerie adds a certain mystery, even though you've seen the girl before. So imo lingerie is more of a turn on than just straight up naked. There will be sex either way though.
Men, what's a big goal in your life right now?	Everyone is being a lot more specific than this, but I would really like to be the best version of myself that I can be. All along I have known what I need to do to be the best I can be, but I am only just now starting this. Quitting smoking 3 months ago, reading and listening to podcasts, playing more music, succeeding in school... But generally succeeding.	Accumulate enough cash in exchange for my labor so that I no longer need to expend my labor to accumulate cash.
What's one thing you've realized as you've gotten older?	Make an effort to spend time with the people you truly care about, because one day they could be gone, suicide, stroke at 49, cancer, etc. Don't waste time on the negative Nancys. No offense meant to any actual Nancys out there.	My energy is not infinite. It isn't a 'waste' of a day to spend it vegging out, if it means I will be rested and productive tomorrow.
We've seen a lot of 'bad women's anatomy' what are some examples of bad men's anatomy?	Blue balls (aka Epididymal Hypertension) is a real thing that many men (including myself) experience. Just keep that in mind if you choose to escalate sexual activity but don't want to go all the way. Yes jacking off helps but doesn't relieve the pain immediately and very rarely is that option readily available.	My ex thought guys nutted on demand and that the vast majority of her ex'es were just shitty dudes that didn't want to give her more dick. I got some gems from that one 'I tell you hwhat.
What is the strangest incompatibility you've had with an SO?	His stomach can't handle food that's been left out on the counter overnight. I can let food sit out on the counter for three or more days, and as long as it passes the sniff test, it's getting in my belly.	She didn't like thinking about anything outside of her immediate surroundings. She would get upset if I talked about space or even other countries. Apparently thinking of things like that made her uncomfortable.
Attn: shy/introverted men. What makes a woman more approachable in your opinion?	I think with all this cat calling and male gaze talk going around guys in general are less likely to initiate a conversation. I'm pretty outgoing and I have a hard time starting a conversation because I don't want to be thought of as sexist, sometimes even if I'm 99% sure she wants to talk.	Let's see, if you insist on being approached rather than approaching yourself, then this is my advice: * Doing things alone - If you're always in a group then you're less likely to be approached by a shy/introverted man because he's more likely to be by himself too. * Being the first to smile - A shy/introverted guy is less likely to be aggressive, so by smiling you signal that you are available to be approached for conversation. * If you are hanging out with a friend or friends, not conversing too loudly or being the "loud one" in the group - Some shy/introverted guys like opposites, but most shy introverts would rather be with someone who seems to have a quiet introspective personality like themselves.
Married friend confided into me a huge secret, how do I tip off her husband?	Best advice: shut the fuck up. It really is none of your business. You should never get between a mama bear and her cub, and don't *ever* get involved in your friends relationships. They are adults, they'll sort it out.	Divorce lawyer here. I've dealt with this situation on four prior occasions. Your friend is so fucked. Before you tell him, you need to realize that this will probably be 'the' defining movement in his life where everything changed. He's happily married one moment, bankrupted by divorce and child support the next, while being a weekend father. This type of bitterness is life consuming. It swallows a person, consumes them, and can prevent a normal life. Tread carefully, and respect enormity of what you are telling him.
Women who have gone to prison. What was it like?	I have been in jail a few times, but never sent to prison. It was alright, I guess. It was deserved and I should have had them come down harder on me, but I am glad they did not.	From my gf: "Extremely fucking boring. I've never felt that level of boredom before." She was in for a year.
Ladies in a relationship, how would you feel if your partner came out to you as bisexual?

What's the best thing you've bought at a thrift store?	A suit that I presume the previous owner never wore because the pockets weren't cut open for 6.50. I've out grown it though (damn my tits) so it's recently gone back to goodwill.	I buy pretty much all my books used or borrow them. Children's books you can get real cheap at book sales, like 25 cents. I also buy all my son's clothes used at Goodwill or consignment. I found him this adorable little track suit in this easy to spot and follow neon yellow for $3. But the best thing? I bought this boring vase for $1 at a yard sale with the intent of storing my spatulas in it. After Googling the engravings, I sold it for $150.
Ladies of Reddit, what's your side hustle?	Does it only count as a "side hustle" if you do it on top of a full time job? Because at one point I was working 80 hours a week at three different, part time bartending jobs. Which one was my side hustle? Or were they all side hustles? Or was I simply just "working" and needed to pick up knitting for an Etsy shop if I wanted to hustle "on the side"? ... I think this came off more aggressive than I meant, lol. I just hate the term "side hustle" and tend to consider work is work is work. When I was cash strapped I simply picked up extra shifts at my current jobs or found another one that fit into my schedule in order to make more money. Just regular hustle.	I hand knit chunky scarves and do manicures on the side at my college. I live in the Midwest so college girls keep me p busy.
What are some signs that make you suspect someone ELSE'S relationship is on the rocks, or won't last much longer? Have you ever been wrong?	Reduced frequency of sex. When my boyfriend's other girlfriend gets harder to schedule and doesn't have sex with him on their dates when they do schedule things, I can guess that she's on her way out. Edit: have been right the last two times. The time before that is what taught me.	Going from an intense flood of social media photos together, to none, is usually a sign that things aren’t as happy behind the scenes.
People who believe men aren't as "manly" as they were 50-100 years ago, why?	Because gender roles are obviously reducing more and more. I believe neither men are as manly as they used to be, and women aren't as feminine as they used to be, and I believe that's a good thing. When the words feminine and manly lose meaning, the world will be a better place.	Increased quality of life makes you softer. Ancient Romans were tough by today's standards. The Barbarians thought they were pampered pussies.
How do you/would you deal with dating someone who loves you more than you love them?	leave them? why stay in a relationship that you *know* you're not feeling the best feelings for? don't stay with someone because **they** love **you**, stay with someone because **you** love **them** i do realize this leaves your SO in a shitty situation of "loving more than loved", and the same may happen to you later when you love someone more than they love you back. but thats how things go, you keep going until two people who both love each other equally are together.	Do not hide or fake feelings to be appeasing. Be direct and upfront. Enjoy the loves she expresses and show appreciation.
(19 years old)- What basic tips could you give on how to act confident around girls?	There just as scared of you, if not more, as you are of them. Or maybe im getting them and spider monkeys confused again? My mistake. You should assert dominance by making yourself big, wave your arms around and make loud noises all while keeping eye contact. Now that I think of it. Im pretty sure thats what you do when your on fire... Hmm Best bet is to relax and play dead then. That always does the trick.	Start with this: Fail. Fail again. Keep failing until you succeed. Repeat. If you want to befriend them, it goes a long way to act like they're your oldest friend even though you just met. The quickest way to a new friend is to act like they're an old friend. Tease them, joke around, make an inside joke between you two.
Is anyone else jaded from the dating scene?	After reading your replies here I am thinking you feel this way because you have no idea what you want. You switch back and forth between appearing to want a serious boyfriend and having a fling with your current guy. No wonder guys run from you like animals from the forest fire. Guys who are looking to just fuck are not getting it from you and moving on, and more relationship oriented guy can see that something is off about you and don't want to see you again as well. Figure out what you want and focus on getting that. I think you are going to be much happier then.	I feel the same way. The big problem that I keep running into is either I'm interested in them and they're not interested in me or vice versa. It's never both parties being interested in each other.
Ladies, what was the most surprising/shocking thing you learned after losing a bunch of weight?	I lost about a hundred pounds due to treatment for a disease. The biggest shock to me was how much excess skin you're permanently left with - literally pounds and pounds of just shrivelled, hanging, and repeatedly infected skin. I was miserable and almost suicidal for years, but with time and improved treatment, have gradually returned to my normal weight (~300 lbs). While I face more hatred and discrimination from others at this weight, I hate myself a LOT less. Also, I just feel 'normal' again, whereas I knew my less-fat body wasn't really me, it was like I was playing dress-up as a 'fake' thinner person.	I was surprised how pronounced my cheekbones are. I always have had chubby cheeks even when I was a skinny kid but it's crazy how different your face looks.
[NSFW] What are some sexual thoughts you have that you are ashamed of?	I'm interested in incest. Ladyboys too. Always wanted to fuck my mom and sister. Some cousins too. Want to see a ladyboy fuck my wife while I watch and perhaps fuck the ladyboy in the ass.	I wonder what it would be like to have sex from the girl's point of view. That said, I'm a guy so I'll never really know.
Which female public figures do you admire and why?	Hillary Clinton. She's smart, passionate, and has worked diligently for human rights and the American public since she was young. She never gives up in the face of relentless bullying, and has held her head high throughout more bullshit than most of us will face in our lifetime. She's been demonized, but I'm pretty sure she'said going to go down in history as a tragedy of partisan politics.	Malala. Girl got shot IN THE FACE as a teen and was like “nah imma keep fighting for girls education, fuk u taliban”. But she even went on a talk show and said if a taliban member came up to her and was gonna kill her she would tell them that she even wants education for them and their children. That woman is incredible
Men with long eyelashes as a side effect of being hairy, how often do women wish they could steal your lashes?	I hear this nearly every day and it's just something I've some to live with. I get it now. It used to make me angry when people would insist I was wearing mascara and eyeliner. Later I used it to my advantage and had all the dates. Now it's just a part of my day for someone to want my eyelashes.	All the fucking time dude, like holy shit. My wife has always been jelous of my eye lashes, says they are wasted on me. We had a daughter a few years ago, and she 100% got my eyelashes. I told my wife that I wasn't wasting them, just saving them to give to her
How often do you all shower?	I shower like once a week! I have a job that doesn't require enough energy to make me sweat, and I'm naturally fit (yay metabolism) so I never exercise. I have short puxie hair that doesn't get greasy, either. So... Yeah. When it's time to shave or I get dirty, I shower.	At least once a day, twice sometimes. I have a weird thing with showers. I find them really comforting and I feel gross if I don't shower at least once a day, even if I didn't do anything.

How have women in your life enforced or encouraged traditional male gender norms/expectations?	Norms don't need to enforced or encouraged, they simply *are*. If a guy does something outside the norm **everyone** will notice. That will cause the guy to feel incredibly uncomfortable and he'll double down on the norm. Norms are, by and large, good for society because they allow us to avoid a lot of unnecessary awkwardness. As far as influence goes I think what (mainly young) men pay most attention to is a) What women say they hate and b) What type of guy women date/go for.	I had a conversation with a female coworker today who literally said men should stand when a women enters the room.... ...it was strange.
What's a dumb argument you had with someone recently?	I'm a self defense advocate and second amendment supporter. I once got in a Facebook argument with someone because they complained that terrorists don't get proper due process then commented that gun owners should all be shot in the back of the head without any due process. Their justification is that they did not trust themselves with a firearm. Someone else argued against me when I challenged them on a tech help forum when they said that a major retailer was selling RAM that was preinfected with malware, I simply explained that it's impossible and they got defensive and cussed me out for being a know it all. I'm a computer tech who has an engineering level of understanding with computers.	I had an argument with my husband last week about whether or not Lana Kane is ALWAYS wearing a turtleneck dress. We went back almost two seasons of us yelling at each other - "turtleneck dress!" or "no turtleneck dress!"... Conclusion: I was wrong.
What is something you weren't aware you were meant to be self-conscious about until an advertisement told you that you should be?	Not really sure that ever happened to me. At least I don't remember. Maybe it's because I don't watch a lot of advertisements.	"Stress sweat smells worse than regular sweat" still does a number on me. Now, whenever I'm stressed and maybe slightly sweaty, I had the ADDED stress of freaking out that I stink!
What are your non-appearance based deal breakers?	From experience I know if the girl prefers cats over dogs we will not be compatible. Being stupid and/or ignorant is increasingly becoming the biggest deal breaker I have. Drug use gets an automatic nope. So does political differences.	She has to be kind. If she's not kind, it's a no-go. She can call herself sassy, sarcastic, driven, a diva, or anything she wants, but it doesn't matter. Either be kind or GTFO.
What does /r/AskMen think of this "Peter Pan Syndrome" shaming on men lately?	I think it's weird if someone is in their late 20's/early 30s and not putting any effort into getting out of their parents house. It;s also a bit strange if they are not dating or trying to date. I mean, if that makes you happy, cool. But what's going to happen when mom and dad get old and sick or pass away? You'll have no work experience and need to get a job. It won't be a good time.	My main reaction to the link provided is "my God, what a badly-written article." Really, it's a mishmash of half-pursued topics, even leaving the writing itself out of it. I guess some people aren't doing what other people expect of them, basically. There's a lot to pick through in this specific link (I mean, she goes from 'kinda laid-back' to 'dudes with real issues' and back again) but I would put out there the idea that, as in many areas of life, you find what you measure and you get what you reward.
What do you like and dislike about the way your parents raised you?	My parents spoiled me too much which at this point of my life sometimes can be good some others not so much. They gave me free will, which I respect, made an independent woman and have always supported my decisions. But, I am selfish and way too opinionated	I was safe, well-fed, well-educated. But I was also made very aware of my mistakes, taught not to think too highly of myself, and trained to think of myself as just a bit disappointing.
What is something you find secretly attractive about a girl?	Feminine, friendly personality. I've seen a few 5's or 6's who exude femininity. That alone boosts them to a 7 or a 7, since I've realized not to go on strictly looks. Even 9's and 10's with a bitchy, masculine personality will knock them down to a 5 or a 6 in my book.	I have a thing for big / odd noses. Like I find Sara Bareilles super attractive, and I think a lot of that is her nose. Thing is, you can't really tell a girl "I love your big nose", so I usually keep that to myself.
Queer women, what do straight people not understand?	I've generally not have had issues with straight people. I've had issues with jackasses, but those are everywhere. I feel that this topic is assuming a divide that, like that, is only existing in the heads of a vast minority. Well. Opinions.	Coming out, and how it's not just a one time 'I'M OUT' party. It's over and over and over again with everyone you meet and sometimes more than once with people you have met. Heterosexuality is a hegemony in our society and it *sucks*.
What Dad Joke was your Dad's go-to while you were growing up?	Son: Dad, where are my crayons? Dad: it would be in the same box where you last put it. This is my usual dialogue with my kids. After sometime, Son: Dad...please? Dad: ok.... in the blue box... Son: It's not there.... Dad: Did you check thoroughly? Son: ya...there it is. Dad: Focus on whatever you are doing... Son: But had you asked me to check thoroughly during the first time itself, I would have focused. .... The above is by my younger son's recent retort..	***EVERY*** single God damn time I started a sentence with, "Well,-" he'd quickly go, "that's a deep subject." EVERY TIME. Still my favorite joke to pull on people to this day.
Women who are generally considered attractive, how accurate is Reddit's assessment of how great your life is?	Reminder to stay on topic everyone. It's okay to have one thread about women's experiences that doesn't turn into how men have it harder in dating than women.	Reminder to stay on topic everyone. It's okay to have one thread about women's experiences that doesn't turn into how men have it harder in dating than women.
Those of you who grew up poor or without regular access to hygiene products, what’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve had to do to get through a period?	Why hasn't anyone used paper towel? I mean bounty is the quicker picker upper... They show people pouring gallons of liquid and it holding. Wouldn't that be a no brainer?	It was the 90s. I'd been given a large carton of teen magazines from the 80s, clipped the free sample coupons from the corners of the carefree/tampax/etc ads and posted them all. For months I was getting free samples in the mail, daily. The samples lasted me a coupla years actually, the only downside was finding a use for all the "tampon hiding" containers and wallets they all sent with the products!! Now, as an adult in a better financial position, I make sure we have plenty of sanitary products for myself, friends and guests and my daughters also have their own stash for when the time comes. They've also been told clearly that those items are a priority, as much as food staples, and that there will always be money to buy them.
Sup other dudes. Who else is going to be alone this Christmas? What are you going to do?	I mean, I'm not going to be alone but if I was my response would be: hang out, eat well, be grateful, go outside, get ready for a new day, go to bed early, read, sleep.	Get up unwrap the gifts I bought (and wrapped for myself) give my dogs their gifts. go to the gym. Cook my Christmas dinner ( bought a buncha seafood to make). Hang out with my dogs, enjoy my new toys and prob drink a lot of booze and pass out alone
Men of Reddit how thought they'd never get a girlfriend, how did you eventually get one?	I think men really work up in their heads how hard it is to get a date. I mean sure, you need to make a few base minimums. Workout, get fit. You don't have to be super ripped or bodybuilder spec, but it really helps. Women notice. Get social, talk to people everywhere you go. Even if they're not friendly back, if you're forced to interact with someone (like in customer service or something) be nice and polite to them and try and make conversation. Smile. Carry those skills over to talking to women you interact with. When you can make a good conversation and make a good impression, ask them out	I started asking out girls at the age of 14. I was rejected over and over and over and over again. It was incredibly depressing and terrifying and made worse by the fact that I couldn't make friends either. I would have been a denizen of /r/foreveralone if it had existed at the time. When I was 22 and in my final semester of college, a girl said yes when I asked her out on a date. She became my first girlfriend. Now I'm happily married (to a different woman, though). Good luck, OP.
Straight men of AM: what's the one thing about female sexuality/anatomy you learned from a SO that surprised you?	Nothing. Actually, with all the partners I've had, I've usually known more about female sexuality/anatomy than them, and have taught them stuff about their own bodies than they knew...	Pretty much everything to do with periods. I thought you just stuck the tampon in, amd you were all done. I also thought some sort of seal broke at the end of the week and it all just came out. Lots of stuff
What tiny thing annoys you but you can't rant about it to your friends?	"He or she deleted me on [Social Media Site]" no they didn't the unfriended you. You were not deleted. Deleting implies destruction of data.	The spread of misinformation on social media is probably my biggest pet peeve. People will learn something from one source and panic a ton of their friends without ever even bothering to do a little more research, see what official news sources say, or reading past the headline in general. Absolutely cannot stand it. I feel the need to fact check for people but I'm sure I'd be just as annoying in return. I can't rant about it to my friends because it happens every fucking day and they'd get sick of it.. Also I can't figure out why I care that some acquaintance I seldom talk to and all their gullible friends are misinformed. **Edit:** Also guess what it's almost 2016 and as it turns, west coasters DON'T all have radiation sickness/cancer from Fukushima. So glad half my Facebook friends *"vowed"* to move east to avoid the Fukupocalypse.
What do you do when you're not really sexually attracted to a potential SO/wife, but in all other aspects she is perfect for you?	What the fuck kind of a question is this? Do you want to have sex with the person you marry? Yes? Case closed. Fuck off with this stupid bullshit	Why not just have a cool friend? If you don't want to sleep with her, don't. Problem solved. You are absolutely right, physical attraction is important. Nothing wrong with not being attracted to someone.
To married women: Is your husband different from the kind of a man you always imagined to marry when you were younger?	I never really imagined the kind of man I would marry. I didn't know that I would be so fortunate as to find someone who is so amazing and awesome, but I am very grateful for our life together.	I think I thought I'd marry a Disney character rather than a real man. But my fiance is almost everything I've ever wanted. He's smart, funny, kind, simultaneously really cool and super dorky, fun, strong and handsome. And he treats me like a princess. Actually, maybe I found a Disney character after all.

What day do you consider to be the worst in your entire life?	An amalgamation of multiple days in Alaska. My memory of my time there is a bit screwy so I don't necessarily know what bad shit happened on different days.	The day I snooped through my ex wife's phone and found out that she was cheating on me with her crossfit friend. Then confronting her about it and her telling me that she loves him.
When is the last time you had to put your foot down with your SO?	if I put my foot down with my SO, it *will* be the last time. no, but seriously, for all the arguments we go through, I am very lucky to have someone who is willing to listen to a rational viewpoint. I cannot recall a single instance where either of us have been inflexible enough to put our respective feet down.	We just bought a house so there's a lot of decisions where one of the other is putting their foot down. We have disposable income but I had to put my foot down for a spending freeze because she's going crazy buying stuff for the house, some of it is stuff* we need but most of it is just stuff we want. We've already spent several thousand dollars on things we didn't need to and pushed aside things we probably should have spent that money on instead. So I said money freeze, she didn't like it but also didn't disagree.
Many beards start out poorly, but grow into masterpieces. What are some predictors of a good vs bad beard?	Predictor of a bad beard: Your dad can't grow one. You don't shave for months but never get anything more than scraggley hairs.	Stick with it for at least 6-8 weeks minimum. Mine grows in a little patchy early on and doesn't look fantastic but with time it looks much better and more full
What online service is worth the monthly fee and why?	Do yourself a favor and pay for an anti-virus for your devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. It's usually a yearly subscription. Just Google "best anti-virus of [insert year]" and pick one from one of the articles. You can go with free, but you get what you pay for. I find many free ones to have annoying "features."	Netflix and Spotify. I listen to A LOT of music so definitely worth it for me and Netflix is just awesome.
My SO is currently trying to cuddle me to death. What adorable ways do your partners drive you crazy?	He tickles me so hard I get an asthma attack. Then he laughs at me for not being able to breathe and then tickles me some more.	He always wants me to stop what I'm doing and kiss him at the most inconvenient times. Sometimes I get mad but I secretly love it. :)
TIL that when men pee sitting down, their penis sometimes touches the toilet bowl. What other crap do you guys put up with that most women wouldn't know about?	>"and sometimes even goes in the water" Ahhahahahahahahaha. Oh dear lord. Ok, so the distance that would take for a flaccid penis to drop into the water, at least around where I live, when sitting on the seat, would be about 10 inches from groin to water. That guys erection would be like 3 cans of coke taped together. Silly. Touching the porcelain happens. Being able to tell the depth of a swimming pool with your eyes closed does not.	When you get a boner, it's easy for it to get caught in a funny position in your pants. The results are quite uncomfortable, and moving wrong can quickly result in tent pole that everyone can see. As such, every man above about 13 learns the masterful art of subtly fixing his penis position with a quick motion while getting up or shifting position. It's truly an art form.
What are some qualities of a manipulator?	"You never ______" - literally had this happen to me in the last 20 minutes. For him it was "you never laugh at my jokes." You never do this for me, you never do that for me. You do this all the time for whoever, but you don't ever do it for me. Its subtle intrusion and manipulation. Your feelings and reactions are not important and don't have to be genuine, but my feelings are more important.	Manipulators will make you feel like everything is always somehow your fault. You'll find yourself apologizing for things you really shouldn't have to, and trying to avoid upsetting them is like walking on eggshells.
Ever had that extreme cockblocker?	To the cute chick: "Hey, I think you're cute. How about we talk sometime without your self-appointed chaperone?" And to the bitch, if needed: "Look, I know it bugs the shit out of you that men are interested in your friend and never want you, but turning the bitch dial up to eleven is not going to fix your problem. Go on a diet, learn how to do your hair and make up, or if that doesn't work, just go hang out in a bar and pick up drunk dudes."	Dont judge her by her friends behavior she cant be held responsible for that outburst. The cockblock girl was clearly jealous no one ever tries to chat her up. I say go for it.
Bisexual women of Reddit, what are some notable differences between being in a relationship with a man and a woman? What about sex?	Every comment is basically saying dating women is better.. so maybe y'all are actually just gay? I don't see why you'd date men at all if you prefer to date women. But I guess the followup question is what do you like about men or dating men that makes you confident that you're bisexual and not just gay?	I feel more cared for by women. Though maybe it's just the men I've dated. For me, men are more likely to do some kind of grand gesture like buy a really nice present on your birthday, and consider "romantic box ticked" for a while. But women will send you that text before that presentation you're really nervous about, or say they found that one thing that you were talking about doing for a while...just generally consider you and your feelings more in daily life.
Fat guys: What did you eat today?	Nothing so far, I don't eat much which is my problem. 2 bowls of cereal yesterday. Has ask men assumed my gender?	2 bowls of oatmeal, 1 bag of salad, 1 salmon fillet, 1 container of rice, 1 protein bar. Currently 400 calories under my target for the day(which is 500-600 calories under my TDEE) Currently down 20 lbs with 30 more to go.
What's the dumbest thing you ever did as a kid/teen?	Am I the only person that never did anything dumb? I hear so many people on reddit talking about them being "stupid teenagers," and I'm sitting here like, why would you EVER think that was a good idea?	I tried to kill a spider with gasoline. Me and my friends were lighting off fireworks in my backyard using gas to light off multiple bottle rockets at the same time. Someone saw a spider on the ground and we got the bright idea to set it on fire too. Well, we poured gasoline on the spider and set it alight at which point the spider sprinted towards the open gas can and kamikazied itself into the gas can. Which exploded into flames and turned into a raging inferno ten feet high. I had to sprint inside and grab a fire extinguisher, and to this day (10 years later) my parents don't believe me when I tell them that a spider was what nearly burned our backyard down.
What made you get divorced?	Guy here. My STBX and I grew apart. Together for twelve years and married for ten. The things we had in common when we met went away as we changed. There was no cheating, beating or drinking as they say. We also found new hobbies that held no mutual interest. It is an amicable divorce and although sad, we both want each other to be happy. We never had kids which makes things easier.	The people we grew into were not compatible. We spent the majority of our marriage living as kind-of-friendly roommates. We were together about 10 years, married for around 7 or 8 of those. I realized that I would be happier alone and single than staying in a relationship that was completely unfulfilling with a person who was not compatible with me. We discussed it and decided that we wouldn't have even dated if we met as we were then, so there wasn't much of anything to hold us together. We divorced - and I was right. My life has been amazing since then and I am now married to someone who is very compatible with me and our relationship is very fulfilling.
Those that suddenly moved to a different city/state/country how did you find a job and what was your process in moving?	When ppl go to a new country they dont just, usually, go there head on. In most cases they find a job and a place to stay (through connections/on their own) first, then they travel to that said country and settle in.	Sell everything that doesn't fit in car Drive to new city (it was 3000 miles) Crash on friends couch while I got an apartment Find job Stay 15 years so far
Women who’ve been married for 5+ years, how’s the sex, really?	Is there a reason for the experience of married couples to matter, and not the experience of long-time partners, in general?	This year will be 10 years married, 14 years together. Sex is infrequent. Besides the first year together, it’s always been like that. We’ll go through periods where we’ll have sex more often, but it’s usually about once a month. We are both highly susceptible to stress, and need long amounts of time to recharge. We are also both on antidepressants that lower our libido. We used to get really stressed out about how little sex we have, but one day, my therapist said something that really struck me. She said that if our libidos were about the same (which they are), then what’s the problem? And we realized our main stress about it was because of comparing our frequency with other people, so when we stopped doing that, things got a lot better.
What is a sacrifice if any that you have had to make in order to become more successful at dating/relationships?	Believe it or not, my dating life improved a whole lot when I started using makeup. Nothing heavy, just the basics of making myself more presentable.	When I moved in with my SO I had to start washing my bras more often so he didn't think I was a filth goblin.
Non-American black men: to what extent do you relate to Black Culture as portrayed in US-centred media (movies, tv shows, music, memes, etc.)?	I'm not Black. However, a dope rapper named Shad [made a song addressing this issue within the Canadian Context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jhn3X8gGEA) that is lyrically one of the best rap songs I've ever heard He's a Kenyan born in Rwanda amidst the European sponsored genocide	Not at all. I've always been told I'm an oreo(black on the outside, white on the inside), because of my mannerisms, way of speech, and likes in music and movies and the such. So, yeah, not at all. Unless you mean relate in relation to racial discrimination or the like. In that case, mostly no; I spent most of my life before college in Saudi Arabia(I'm sudanese), and I've encountered little(albeit noticeable) racism, maybe because I was privileged, and the environment I was raised and educated in was, well, educated. In Sudan where I am now, a country in north Eastern Africa, everyone's black, so yeah.
Lads, which of your jokes are you still riding the high from years later?	In high school, I had an art class where I sat at a table with this girl named Alexis. It was only us two at the table, so we had the whole class period to flirt with each other. She asked if I had a girlfriend. I answered "no". She said "Oh, so do you just have hoes?" I responded, "Something like that." "What's one of your hoes' names?" "Alexis." EDIT: Nothing spectacular happened. She just smiled and we talked about something else.	Sort of the opposite, someone made a joke to me so good that it stabbed my very soul. Someone once told me that I could make love to a cheerio and not break it. Still hurts.
What are some general rules of thumb for cooking that every man should know? What are the meals you feel that every man should know how to cook?	This is more a personal rule, but I find if you're not sure, it's better to over cook than undercook.	Let you meat sit after cooking and before cutting. Baked Ziti is easy and lasts for days. You can sub ziti for almost any other pasta type and it makes a very slightly different dish.
What is your most "politically correct" opinion?	Racism, sexism, and other systems of oppression refer to prejudice *plus power.* It's only in the colloquial usage of the words that they can go both ways. For purposes of academic discussion and research, they can only go one way in any given society.	A little bit of tact and understanding can go a long way when talking to people who hold different values and views.
Men of reddi, how did getting in shape change your life?	You're in dangerous waters bro, some extremely healthy and active 500pound person is gonna flip out that you don't have to get in shape to change your life.	Pros: I look better, I'm happier with myself, people are nicer to me (not just girls) and I just feel better in general. Con: I can't eat as many brownies as I would like
What are some simple “rules” you and your partner set for a better relationship?	To be honest, we haven't needed them because respect has always come naturally. We don't call each other names or insult each other during disagreements, we don't yell, we share the housework.. but none of those things were pre-planned or talked about. There is no one "his" chore or "my" chore. We just do what needs to get done as we come across it. Exceptions being things I can't do because I have no idea how.. like cleaning the outdoor pond.	We thank each other for the chores we do instead of being resentful for the ones we “always” do and the other “never” does. Sometimes when I’m sweeping and vacuuming or cleaning the toilet I get all grumbly like “He never does this” and then I remember he always does the laundry and grocery shopping and that helps my grumbles.
What are your best stories from attending a friend's wedding?	A good friend of mine got married about 7 years ago. She has this amazing red hair and pale skin and chose a very light green dress to get married in and looked spectacular. Her husband's mother had a fit and said that **someone** had to wear white and forced her son to wear a white suit. Not too much wrong with that as he looked kinda cool, but then she arrived in white herself. My chin was sore from dragging it around on the ground all night at the reception.	Well when my sister got married (also best friend status) she had this beautiful, modest but very chic and classy wedding where we were all dressed like we were going to a nice formal brunch and all the bridesmaids wore tea-length gowns and it was all so lovely and nice. Then ther father-in-law shows up with his shitty girlfriend and she's literally wearing lingerie as a dress and thigh-high boots. He also insisted she be in every family picture so all their wedding photos have these nice ladies and men in fancy brunch clothes.....and what looks like a call girl. I'm not trying to be mean or prudish, but she was so disgusting and innapprorpiate. My sister was pissed, I was pissed for her.
Do you ever inform people "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" when they ask you polite questions?	I have a friend who likes to say to managers "Hey, X did a good job helping me today" whenever we're out (even if they didn't really do anything at all), so he always asks workers what their name is. Women workers respond "I have a boyfriend" about 50% of the time. It's always awkward.	It's such a double edged sword. I don't yell "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND" in someone's face if I'm having a conversation with them. But if I'm at a party conversing with a guy, I might casually slip in "oh yeah my boyfriend told me about that" or something along those lines. My friend on the other hand HATES doing that so she's been called a tease a fair amount of times. It's to the point that I feel like I can't make have a conversation at a party with a guy without feeling guilty.
What are some good ways to casually see if a female friend is interested?	Ask her, via text, if she's into you or wants to make out. If she says anything but "Yes!" just say "oops that as my friend haha lol heh".	We went to an amusement park and a concert together on Sunday and had an incredible time. The feelings took me by surprise, caz I’ve always just seen her as a friend. We’re hanging out this weekend again so I’d like to see if she’s feeling the same way
Have you ever been with a guy who either slipped the condom off or finished inside after saying he would pull out?	That's rape and no thankfully I've never been in that situation my friend did though she took him to court	Yep. It broke during, but he just threw it to the side and finished anyway. Then he told me something like, "I guess you need to go take care of that". I was 19 and he was the second guy I ever slept with. I tried calling the hospital to find out what I had to do, but they got really catty with me about looking for EC and said "we don't offer that kind of thing to people". I ended up driving all the way to a Planned Parenthood in St. Louis (he did not help with anything) lying about where I was going. Of course, there were protesters there, and I had to walk past a group of about 30 people holding signs and yelling at me about fetuses and such, all alone and scared to death. It was the worst.
To the guys that WANT to be single right now, what are your reasons?	I've realized that right now, women seem to be too self centered, so getting to know someone isn't going to really happen. I'd love to make a deep connection, but because of Fbook and Instagram and Tinder, it's just not happening.	Kinda stuck in the middle here. Abstractly I want a relationship and companionship, but whenever I get close to the actual possibility I start to see all the reasons it would be inconvenient.
Men of Reddit, what do you think about dating apps?	They suck. I’m just trying to have causal hookups (Bc woman are just as horny as men) and for some reason women won’t just come over and have sex with me? Maybe it’s broken idk /s	Awful, depressing, and demoralizing, but I don't go out and meet people in real life, so they're marginally better than nothing.
Women who have masculine features (eg. broad shoulders, tall stature etc.), how do you deal with self acceptance/confidence?	Well I'm aMab and I feel like the ideal way I want to look and present myself as Is impossible as it would require them I feel well ever be feasible to do. But beyond that, I still present as male, which sucks because I feel like I don't count as trans. Since I'm neither suffering outwardly from my identity, or being treated as being trans, it feels like people just think I'm just saying I'm trans for the social capital and in order to fit in and I don't have any claim to it because I'm not giving anything up. I'm also terrified that that's indeed the case and I'm just a selfish bigoted fake. I have issues around this stuff	I'm 5'10 and built like a linebacker. I will never be delicate or dainty. But I love how big and solid I am. I am a very formidable presence. Growing up it wasn't easy. I've been this tall since I was 12-13. Lot of mean comments. But it's the only body I've got and it's trying it's best.
Why do women smell so good?	For me, it's natural selection at work. I'm a heterosexual male; most women smell really good to me, no matter how dirty and sweaty they get. Sometimes they don't, and I've learned to assume there's a good reason for it, evolutionarily, when that happens. For instance, one girl I thought was visually quite attractive early in my life, but who smelled not-so-good to me, later 'came out' as lesbian. Other times I've been with women that I initially didn't fancy so much, but who smelled so good I could hardly stand it.	So a number of years ago, when my older brother was still just dating his now wife, me and his girlfriends younger sister were pretty hot for each other, but we were both a bit hesitant about it because our siblings were dating. One time when we were out camping with buddies, drunk around the campfire she tossed her army jacket at me and it wrapped over my head right as I was inhaling. It was more than just smells. I got goosebumps head to toe, shuddered, and immediately went fully erect. It was a literal slap in the face of pheromones.
What do you consider a disturbingly common bad science "fact"?	"The wage gap isn't real" and "there are two genders." The wage gap actually exists, but it's not what you think it is. All of the conservative/MRA/fascist/etc. "critiques" of the wage gap end up fundamentally misunderstanding what the gap *is* and *adjusting for the gap itself* to disprove it. Conservatives/fascists/MRAs/etc. also fail miserably when it comes to understanding things like gender and sex. They screech "facts don't care about your feelings," but their arguments are literally tradition and feelings-based. It has nothing at all to do with science. Nearly all of the relevant scholarship backs up "le SJWs" on this one. Basically any time a reactionary claims "facts don't care about your feelings" you can be sure that they're, in fact, making an argument from emotion. It's an old fash trick to accuse your opponent of the thing you, yourself are doing.	I've seen this [Tumblr quote/poem](https://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Breakup+feels_8d9fbd_5090851.jpg) floating around fairly often, whether it's on Facebook or whatever -- the idea that "every cell in your entire body" is destroyed and replaced every 7 years. I get that it sounds poetic, but it's incorrect. RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days, skin epidermal cells are sloughed off every 2-4 weeks, the epithelial lining of your mucosa (think -your GI/oral cavity areas) is also sloughed off and replaced every few days, some of the cells of your immune system only live hours to less than 2 days, osteocytes have an average half life of 25 years, and although the research on this is ongoing, neurons can potentially last a lifetime (although pruning does happen in your adolescent years). To slap this arbitrary, scientifically incorrect number (and to attribute it to a professor!) on the body's complex apoptotic and regenerative cycles is just ridiculous.
Ladies, how do you let your SO know you need more attention in a vulnerable way rather than a needy way?	I hug him for an extra-long time. He wraps his arms around me, and kisses my head, and asks if everything is okay or if I want to talk about it.	Just an honest, frank discussion. Focus on the way you're feeling rather than the things he/she does. It's ok to be needy sometimes, but talking about it in an honest way lets it come from a place of sincerity and vulnerability. Use statements like "I've been feeling lonely/isolated and I miss you, it would mean a lot if we could spend more time together, without video games/tv/other people." Hopefully your SO loves and respects you enough to not dismiss that as needy or nagging.
"Once a Cheater, Always a Cheater"... Talking to a girl who cheated before. Thoughts on this philosophy?	Nah, most humans cheat, or at least *would* cheat if they weren't scared of the consequences (so they pretty much actually cheat in their minds, just not in practice). I would totally be ok with that, we're all fallible, and its human to err.	You think being a rebound and her cheating are a confidence or self image issue? I'd think the rebound is more a coping with a breakup thing and cheating more an avoiding confrontation decision.
What feels better than a blowjob?	Sex, a cold drink after a hard day of work. Finally landing that skateboard trick you've been going at for days. A lot, there's more to life you know.	I don't know if you've ever had a hard cast on for a prolonged period of time for a broken bone. After a certain point it becomes a test of your willpower to endure the itchiness and discomfort of the damned thing. When it's taken off though? You think itching the previously restrained appendage is nice? Try sticking it in a warm shower and THEN itching it. Sweet merciful Jesus, I did this with a previously casted leg and had what I can only describe as a "leg orgasm." It's disgusting, dead skin and hair just peel off everywhere but you can't stop because it feels like being massaged by angels.
Social etiquette-wise, what's something you really like when you notice people doing it?	If a man I just met curses, tells an off color joke without knowing that I find those jokes funny, spits, etc. and apologizes. Obviously an apology isn't required (or even expected) but it's nice to know that some men still think it's important to be a gentleman, even in the presence of a woman they don't know.	When someone is adept at introducing people at a social gathering. No awkwardness and it makes everyone feel welcome and comfortable.
Have you ever dated someone on the autism spectrum and if so, how was the relationship? Would you do it again?	Yes he's my life partner and father of my 2 beautiful children. Hes a hobby jumper and reads every minute he can go keep his mind occupied. He's a multitasking god lol. He's an ask and I'll do kind of guy but I'm a please pick up that I need this so I don't have to tell you kind of girl so that clashes a bit. He's pretty blunt and speaks his opinion which I love most of the time. We work well and we love each other dearly	I am actually on the autism spectrum. I have dated my ex who was also autistic. We broke up for reasons unrelated to autism. The relationship was hard, but I think half of it had to do with distance issues. It would be hypocritical for me to say that I wouldn't date someone that's autistic when I am myself. I would date someone who was autistic again if I was single, but I am married to a NT husband who does his best to understand and accept autism.
What is the most disgusting meal a family member has ever served for you?	My sister made baked macaroni one time and included breadcrumbs in the dish, which I thought was super weird but I'm not a doctor or anything so I didn't say anything. When she brought it to the table there was an inch-thick layer of breadcrumbs over the entire dish. Humans can't eat like that. It's an abomination. I gently scraped some of the breadcrumbs off my serving and my sister called me out for it, saying it was her mom's recipe and that it was good and then my dad told me I had to eat it. She's his favorite I think and he never wants to hurt her feelings. Family politics aside, they both watched me closely to make sure I ate all the dry foul crumbs and everybody else was able to hide or otherwise dispose of theirs because security was so focused on me.	My mom made meatloaf once that I will never forget. It was white. Not sure why. Our dog wouldn't eat it. My mom also made an apple pie once that was a mile high and looked delicious. Only problem was the crust was so hard no one could cut it. My dad declared it a turtle and took us kids down the street to the river where we let it go. Good times! My mom's regular meal was Mac and cheese. It was elbow macaroni cooked in milk. Not sure where the cheese came into that concoction. I never knew Mac and cheese as anything good until my 20s.
What is the worst Tinder date/ experience you’ve ever had?	went back to her place for sex, 2 and a bit years later and i'm in the most loving relationship of my life- worst hook up app ever!	Went back to his place, presumably for sex, and the pillowcases were stained with blood. Place was filled with empty beer cans. Four, I kid you not, four rusty, hair-filled razors in the shower (all were his - he lived alone.) The sink was coated in hair and toothpaste. I was so disturbed. Then he told me he had a suspended license and a kid he never met, and I high-tailed it home.
What's the best horror movie you've watched? Why is it the best?	The original Halloween is pretty great. A classic. I like cabin fever a lot too, it's a good comedic horror film.	It’s cliche but the Shining is a horror masterpiece, beloved for a reason. It’s the kind of unsettling that creeps into your bones and lingers.
Women who have traveled alone, where did you go and would you recommend solo travel?	Chile, Europe, Hong Kong. It's not safe for women anywhere in the world, so you might as well travel whereever you want.	I went to Costa Rica for two months alone, and I loved it. You're able to make friends more easily from all over the world when you travel by yourself, and you can do whatever you want whenever you want. I've travelled with friends and S.O. before, but nothing is quite as satisfying as traveling all by yourself. You just have to be smart about it.
Men who have predominantly female careers (Teacher, nurse, etc), what's it like? How do women react?	I'm a microbiologist. A lot more females in this field. It made me more empathetic. I don't think it has influenced my choices in attraction or dating behavior. Also I don't notice any difference in treatment from my colleagues or students.	I'm a nurse. I work in the ER, so I'm around a lot more male nurses than I would be if I worked on a floor (other than the ICU). I don't notice any difference in treatment by my female colleagues nor by other men I meet. I'm married so dating isn't a concern but I've noticed that if I'm getting coffee or at the store grabbing breakfast after a shift (I work nights) I get checked out a lot more than I do if I'm in regular clothes.
What are some common complaints from men that you don't/can't actually believe are real things?	I think it's funny that one of the main complaints on AW is when men invalidate women. Which indeed is lame. And then threads like this are popular where half of the responses are just invalidating the experiences of men.	Too many men don't understand female genitals and how the vagina keeps itself clean. As soon as they make a comment about"everything being clean down there" I assume they don't know what clean in that regard actually means. It's a fleshy hole with a distinct balance of good bacteria, bad bacteria, pH etc... Don't expect soap and sparkles. You can tell when things are wrong okay - but a lot of men don't know what healthy is.
When does life start to get better?	1. You're seeing mostly rich white kids having the time of their lives. 2. These are just the high lights. Odds are their experiences weren't anywhere near as great as they make it out to be. They're largely lying to maintain a narrative. 3. Get off Facebook and Instagram. They offer nothing of value. 4. You have to put yourself out there. Start making friends. 5. I won't lie to you kid. Life gets harder after college.	People always put the best aspects of their lives on social media, take it with a grain of salt. Everyone has issues in their lives. The only way to make your own life better is actually doing whatever makes you happy. Don't expect some magical event that'll change everything into rainbows and sunshine. Life doesn't work that way

Have you ever had a girlfriend tell you to drop an existing female friendship? If so, how did that go?	It was very hard topic when i was with my ex. With new gf i made it clear that we never ever check our social network accounts. So i keep up the conversations there and meet my female friends once in a while in real life. Works like a charm :)	Is there any kind of back story? Context matters. Honestly it’s rarely “drop every girl you know.” Were you guys very close? Have a history? If you haven’t spoken to him in five months, is it that big a deal anyway?
Men who have been left at the altar, what's your story?	She left me for her ex on our wedding day. Years later, her ex (now husband) writes a movie about the whole ordeal, making HIM look like the hero and ME look like the jackass bad guy in the red cowboy boots.	My friend was left at the altar by this woman because her mom opposed the marriage (the dude doesn't make a lot of money) and she ended up letting him know the night before, leaving him to cancel everything and letting everyone know. There was no way of letting EVERYONE KNOW that the wedding was canceled so I printed out a most interesting man meme that read "I don't always cancel weddings, but when I do, I do it with a meme" and glued it to the door of the place where the reception was supposed to take place. I ended up just spending the night with him and another friend with some beer and a bottle of tequila. EDIT: to everyone asking it's worse than you think, they got married a year later and right now are going through a divorce. Unexpected I know.
What do you truly regret from your 20s?	I am only 21 and I already regret not going out and party while I'm still young. But honestly I can't really be bothered. Still regret it though.	Not standing up to people/being neutral. If I felt someone was being mean, and I didn't say anything except rolling my eyes. If I saw someone in a sticky situation at a bar and didn't intervene bc "none of my business". Every time Ice stood back and done nothing I regret it. I'd rather look mental and stand up for what I believe is right, than to let things slide.
In a few hours, i'll probably be ending my relationship with my girlfriend. Scared as hell, but i've gotta talk to her. Any advice?	Start with "It's over!" *long pause as the message sinks in* Take it from there. Be honest, don't spare her feelings. But don't lie to 'make a stronger case' or anything. Be prepared to take some 'punches'. But if she starts screaming or worse, just leave.	Probably no amount of words or advice will make the anxiety go away. Personally, I'd take a shot of some nice bourbon a half hour before, take a deep breath, and just rip the band-aid off. This is probably terrible advise, but there's not much else you can do.
Where exactly is the line between having a hard life and just being weak?	When you draw the line, you already took a decision. Fighting daily not to draw the line is the real strength. We all are (mentally) dancing above and below the line. Keep the pace, don't give up and be better than you were yesterday.	I don't think we get to draw the line for anybody else. People fight their own battles; I think they carry their own markers, too. I'm not here to tear apart somebody else's journey. If I can help them, I do. If I can't, I wish them well and go about my life.
I wear F cup bras but have no cleavage. In what ways does your body confuse you?	I'm going to be shit on with down votes here, but I'm being serious. Are you overweight? I've noticed the same phenomenon you're talking about with overweight women, but I don't recall seeing it in women who are fit. That's purely anecdotal, I know. But if you ARE over weight, you might sew some changes in general and with the particular issue you're talking about if you went over to /r/keto or /r/paleo or something. If you're not overweight, my bad.	Often i feel like i have very little spatial awareness. I can open a door and then bam! walk into the damn thing. It's like my body has no idea where it is in relation to the objects around/near it. I can see the damn door just fine but 2 seconds later my face just smacks into it. I need proximity sensors.
What things do you secretly wish your SO would do, that are typically done by the man in the relationship?	Minor vehicle maintenance like oil change, topping off fluids, and washing it frequently. It bugs me when she takes her 06 Accord to the dealership for an oil change using conventional oil and a crappy filter when I have all the tools at home to change it. Not to mention, you can get high class synthetic oil and a top of the line filter for a fraction of what the dealership charges you. Other fluids like coolant, transmission, and brake literally have a MAX line so obviously don't go over that. I don't know if it's a universal thing but every girl I've met so far has had a messy car interior. My gf also doesn't wash her car that frequently and when I ask her to she says she doesn't have time even though she's on her phone during the weekends doing nothing >:(	Initiate sex. I’ve had very few girlfriends who would ever initiate sex ever, let alone be the one to initiate it half the time. I’ve talked about it with them and they even admit to being horny when we were alone at home and sex could have easily happened. Just couldn’t get the nerve to initiate or didn’t occur that they could just walk over and be like “let’s go to the bedroom” Ladies. I’m always game. If I’m not right now I can play along until I’m ready to go.
As a woman with a baby face, how has it impacted aspects of your life?	i just turned 33 in december and i still get pegged for a teenager sometimes. recently i got carded when trying to buy a scratch-off ticket. i've also had (much) younger guys hit on me from time to time. the worst part tho, is meeting a girl who is like MAD cute and you assume she's at least in her 20s (cus you're so used to seeing your own baby face that you subconsciously assume that other people around your age must look as young as you do too) but then you find out she's underage and you just feel gross gross gross UGH it's an actual nightmare	Sometimes people don't take me professionally and seriously at work because I look young. When I was in my 20s, I had people make offhand comments about me being too young for my job (I wasn't). I get carded still, and I sometimes think people are justing my DH because they think hes a lot older. People have also made comments that they thought my younger brother was older than me. All in all, sometimes annoying but nothing that is that major.
What's the biggest culture shock you've ever experienced or witnessed?	Evil Trump and Republicans in 2016. I had no idea that evil could win an election. Now that I know better I actually hate America and the Constitution itself because its like what if the Nazi party had more votes? America 2017 is what happens when Nazi Germany has more Nazi's then rational people who vote. We voted for Hitler in 2016 and I feel obligated to change America now. For the better, against Republicans aka the Nazi Party in America.	It took me a few days to work out that in America entrée means MAIN MEAL. Here, an entrée is the first, light course of the meal (similar to an appetiser), so i'd get these huge ass plates of food and be absolutely bewildered.
My gf has no hobbies and constantly want to be with me, have you had a similar problem?	DAE not understand why this is described as a "problem"? Maybe the two of you are just with the wrong type of person. Because I would have loved to have found at least one attractive, desirable woman in my life that constantly wanted to be with me. It seems to me that you just aren't as into her as she is into you. If you're really into someone, of course you want to spend as much time as possible with them. If you're not really into someone, that gets annoying.	Dumped her after she freaked out when I went to do things without her. Relationships like that are parasitic at best.
If men get paid more than women, why don't all companies just hire women?	Because men don't get paid more(in some places it's the opposite though) ever read that article about the tv producer who decided she would have an ll-female team? shit closed down within a year leaving her broke.	That statistic doesn't control for the type of job. Women, in many cases, take lower paying jobs like retail and service positions. These jobs pay less for everyone, but because the proportion of women that work them is higher compared to men the overall wage for their gender looks like they get paid less. I've never heard of anyone saying there's a widespread problem with women making significantly less than men *in the same job.*
[Meta] How do you feel about having an Apache helicopter as an option in the gender flairs?	It was a stupid fucking joke in the first place used to mock transgender people at about a fourth grade level of discourse, and I have zero respect or toleration for anyone who ever thought it was funny.	Honestly, since this is askmen I wouldn't mind if there was just "male" and "not-male", makes sense to me, come at me. It's either the target demographic or it isn't. The difference between female and agender really shouldn't matter much on this sub. What is "bane" anyway?
What non-sexual thing do you wish you had experienced sooner because you enjoyed it so much when it finally happened?	Trying cocaine. Did it first at 19, was pissed I wasted so many years not knowing how amazing the sensation was.	Working out. I never actually hit the gym until I was in my early 20's. The feeling you get from working out, the confidence, the feel-good endorphins, just everything has been so amazing. I wish I started earlier.
What's something about you that people are jealous of, but it's not as awesome as everyone thinks?	My honesty 😬 most of my girl friends think it's cool that I can just tell anybody how I feel, little do they know I shit myself every time I'm straight forward because that shit can backfire on you REAL quick.	Some of my friends are jealous of the fact that I don't feel pressured to drink. I think it's a good thing too, but it's mostly out of fear that I'll become dependent on it like my father. I feel weird sometimes because I just have no interest in it, and most of the people my age are really into drinking. I just feel like the odd one out. I wish I didn't let fear overrule me and hang over me like some dark cloud ready to unleash a storm, but I just can't seem to shake it.
What are your tips for moving in with your SO?	Write a Roommate Agreement first. Everything must be in writing...money, bills, chores, tv shows, bed time, weekend plans. How to settle arguments... All of it. On paper.	There are relationship issues, and there are rooommate issues. Learn the difference between the two and don’t let one affect the other.
How have the women in your life reacted when you displayed vulnerability?	Female here. God, this thread is depressing. My experience is that those who are on the far ends of the gender spectrum - Manly Men, Girlie Girls - they're the ones whom I've noticed tend to reinforce this kind of callousness. I don't think it's healthy. People should be allowed to be humans with one another, and humans are multidimensional, emotional beings. In my opinion, if someone can't handle any perceived weakness in a partner - and to me it really sucks that emotions other than anger are seen as weak - it's a huge red flag. Neon.	Every time I've ever talked about vulnerable things I've been accepted. Everyone has insecurities. The degree to which I've been accepted varies because of the level of vulnerable things I've shared. I think in my current relationship I've received by far the most love and support when I'm vulnerable.
What are your least favorite AskMen threads?	Honestly, I subscribed to /r/askmen & /r/askwomen at the same time, and the difference is incredible. /r/askmen seems to be full of hostility, whereas /r/askwomen seems to be quite supportive. Both tend to have a lot of rants & complaints about relationships, etc, but the way the two subreddits *handle* the issues are so different. I'm male, and yet I find myself commenting on /r/askwomen much more often than /r/askmen.	The ones that go like this: I'm 16 and she's 14 and we had this huge fight and now I'm scared I might lose *The One*
What's the nicest thing a woman you weren't dating/related to has ever told you?	It's sexual but... She was on top and I said "you know I can keep going for a lot longer right?" and she replied "I know that's why I love fucking you". I was just like yeeeeeaaaaaaaaa booooiiiiiiiii Or there was the time a girl I dated said you are a really genuine person so that's why we have to break up, because you deserve better than me. I'm like "yay?... Awwww shit."	I've had women compliment me on how genuine I am. I think I'm really just too introverted to be capable of being anything other than who I am, still a nice compliment though.
What's a red flag that you feel a lot more women should be aware of?	Similar to littering, I live in an area with free municipal recycling. So I'd say zero effort of trash sorting. One time my friends group went out to a rural area for the weekend with no recycling service. We saved it all and drove it the two hours back to town to put in our home recycling :p	Clinginess or neediness that can turn ugly. A short fuse that they quickly try to gloss over. Putting themselves down but acting like they are above others.
What was your "I dodged a bullet" in a friendship story?	when I first moved towns in year 5 I made two friends, barely lasted three months, didn't like me for no apparent reason, good thing in hindsight, they both do drugs and have left school, wouldn't be surprised if one of them dealt	I was friends with a girl in college for a while. One of her other friends did something to make her mad and she immediately told me all of her friends’ secrets. Deep stuff that I did not need to/want to know. After that I never told her anything and we ended up not being friends because of that. Dodged a bullet.
Students who developed good study habits later in life when they previously had bad habits or none at all, what did you do? Do you still have trouble or are worried you'll slip back?	Care about school. This means spending time on homework, going to office hours, and at least trying to pay attention in class. There really isn't much else. If you can't figure out "how" to study when there are trillions of resources out there to help you, you belong in trade school.	Learned study habits in law school. Basically, there's 2 steps: 1) sat myself in a chair and 2) didn't leave the chair until my work was done. In the beginning you waste a lot of time. But eventually you begin learning to do the work so that you can leave the damned chair. I now work remotely several days a week and this habit has been fantastic at helping me meet my billable work requirements.
As a police officer, in day to day interactions how could I make you more comfortable?	I have a lot of faith in police and only have had positive experiences. Thanks for caring enough to ask this question though.	I work at a place with really heavy security so I spend a ton of time with cops. The ones I'm most comfortable with are the ones who are funny and friendly but remain kind of distant and professional at the same time. There's a good balance to be had. Corny jokes are always welcome. Sexism isn't.
How did your vagina change after birth?	I'm definitely somewhat looser, but it was verging on too tight before my first delivery. What I've seen from most medical sources is that some difference is normal and common (though not universal), but it isn't typically enough to cause serious problems, outside of greater than usual trauma.	My actual vagina? I don’t think it has. My vulva and genital area? I notice my perineum hurts a bit during early penetration, I imagine that’s because I had stitches. Nothing else seems different and my partner confirmed when I asked. I’m just over 3 months postpartum.
Childfree women: what was the worst thing anyone said about your decision to not have kids?	I only sort of can answer.. Regarding fostering and not having bio. kids, anything referring to my family as broken or incomplete or when am I having ~real~kids.... Insulting on so so many levels. I reply in a way that reflects the asker: the douchier they are, the more kurt I am	I have an adopted child. I've been asked multiple times when I'm going to have a real child. Seriously. Once my parents said it. in front of her and they were banned from seeing her ever again (I cut off contact from them years ago over stuff like that). I get asked if I have a medical condition or I get asked if I don't want to ruin my perfect body (from creepy guys). The crazy thing is: I have a daughter! I raise her! She is my soul! And people still say these things!

What's the worst thing your (ex)SO has ever said to you, and did your relationship recover?	Our biggest argument of the relationship. She swears I had an old iPod classic when I had my truck but that old iPod died long before I ever got my truck and I upgraded to an iPod touch. The relationship has recovered from that and I love her dearly.	We were watching Love Actually and he said that he identifies most with the story of the guy who's in love with his best friend's new wife, because he still loves this friend from high school even though she's married now and he's happy with me. He was drunk at the time, and we all have our pasts, so I'm not too upset about it. I don't think he'd cheat on me, even had he the opportunity, but it does make me sad sometimes. And I can't watch Love Actually any more.
Do you think "life skills" should be taught in schools? If so what should that include?	I think bringing social etiquette would be a great idea. Proper table manners, how to introduce someone and be introduced, how to make polite conversation, how to make your interest formally known, and how to politely decline someone's formally expressed interest. I think these skills have been lost and, while I'm not looking to return society to some kind of Victorian ideal, you can see a common theme on Reddit where people basically don't know how to act in these specific ways, and they end up being socially awkward and clueless how to fix it. People used to literally take classes for these things! Maybe bringing it back in a certain extent would be a non-terrible idea.	Absolutely. I think personal finance would probably be the most beneficial; it is appalling how many of my friends have no idea how to manage their money.
What’s the craziest unrealistic expectation you’ve seen someone (whichever gender) have for their potential partner?	All women who expect men not to watch porn in a relationship..I don’t get it, and like why don’t you?	I know someone who wants his partner to be a specific height, but not taller than himself. He doesn't want her to be too short because then he could see her scalp which disgusts him (wtf) and not too tall because he of course thinks that guys should be taller than women. He has other stupid expectations (like no cellulite), needless to say he is single
Have you lost a very close guy friend because he fell for you and you didn't return his feelings?	No because I've dated my friends who had feelings for me. The only time I lost someone's friendship was when he didn't want to date me and did the fadeaway.	Unfortunately yes, and I miss him often. We met in High School and thinking back now, I did flirt and keep him on a string a bit. I knew all along that he had feelings for me but I just couldn't return them. In the end he lost it on me one day (which I don't blame him for), and he wrote me this beautiful letter afterwards but asked me to respect him by never contacting him again. I read the letter once and a while, and I saw him in a local shop for the first time in years the other day. He dodged out and I just left it. He will make a woman incredibly incredibly happy one day. I'm sad I didn't meet him later in life, I think our friendship could have lasted if I was more mature.
What is the reason for smelling women's hair?	I've personally never done it, but I did have a girlfriend that did it to me. It's like she was snorting coke or something sometimes.	Your scent. Your scent is a very powerful aphrodisiac. It is normal throughout the entire animal kingdom. Hard to resist and always intoxicating.
What are your mental hangups?	* I'm really bad at tolerating bullshit, logical fallacies, intellectual dishonesty, willing stupidity or superstitious/religious thinking and can't stand seeing people applauded and rewarded for them. Following the recent US election has been a nightmare for me. (On the other hand, this quality makes me a better teacher.) * I have the capacity to be a caring, loving, encouraging, responsible adult towards my closest friends, but I have a hard time extending that to myself. I over-identify with the vulnerable parts of my psychology and often just forget that I am a strong adult as well. * On an intellectual level I can see why someone would want kids, but I can't relate to this on an emotional level despite the desire being so prevalent. This poses an extra challenge in my friendships with parents. Why are you asking?	I eat out of anxiety, so it would be great if my brain didn't scream at me to carb load every time something unpleasant comes up.
Tomorrow, one color you choose will disappear forever. What color and why?	Blue. I can't tell it apart from green very well. Also, I really dislike a lot of things related to it. The daytime sky, artificially flavored "blue raspberry" drinks, etc.	That yellow/green/brown mix that only appears in vomit and pretty much nowhere else. I have no need for that colour.
Ladies, what is your hobby - and how much money do you spend on it?	I have a lot. -fighting (just sport, not like fight club -Embroidery -surfing -skating (skate boarding) -Knitting -Really complicate puzzles. -viscous & totally personally pointless attacks people on House Hunters. How the fuck often do you "entertain"?!? -history ( I live in Boston, there's a LOT) -reading, about a book a week I might be lame. I'm 100% ok with that. :)	Knitting- Don't get to do it as often as I'd like but usually about $50-100 per project. Hiking- Same. Can't afford backpacking/camping supplies so right now it's free. Photography/art- Not supposed to be a hobby but I'll call it that for now since I haven't bothered to make any money...Probably around $20-100 per month. Reading- $100 per year? I don't know, I buy a lot of used books. Gardening- $300 so far this year.
What was something you had wanted to have so badly but when you finally got, didn't make you as happy as you expected?	Getting married was exactly this. Loads of pussy, no bitching, dinner was cooked and served to me at the table. Now I clean 95% of the house 100% of the time..I have to beg like every other married asshole for the kind of sex that I find satisfying..I'm not a fucking missionary. I have to ask if she plans to cook dinner at all on top of doing most of the other chores. And I get the added bonus of having to hear all the bitching about everything I do wrong while simultaneously ignoring what she does wrong. Marriage yaaaay!!	Adulthood would be the low hanging fruit... Owning my own home would be a personal one, don't get me wrong it's much better than renting but unless you are buying new they can seem like money pits. There is always something the partner wants to upgrade or something breaks or gets broken. Still wouldn't give up owning for the world, just I wasn't as excited as I thought I would be even at first, it was just a house that while technically mine is also the banks. God knows how people on average income buy houses in the South of England Edit: to Clarify I live in the UK
30+ year olds without female experience, how did it happen?	Bookmarking just to see this show. If it happens that is, don't think you're gonna see a lot of guys 30+ speaking up about never getting their dick wet. Why are you scared to hit the 4th base OP?	I was obese most of my life. I had friends up until high school, but a cross-country move and developing depression (undiagnosed at the time) at 15 took care of that. Went untreated for 15 years. Ballooned up to ~450 lbs. Lost a lot of weight starting about 5 years ago (down to 210). But that's also when I realized I had more issues than just the obesity. I started therapy this year, but things have been going slowly. Now I'm caught in a catch 22. Loneliness really is the biggest driver of my worst depressive moods. But nobody wants to be around someone that's lonely or depressed. Which only makes me more lonely and depressed.
At what age did you learn you were either very attractive, mediocre or just straight ugly?	Before yall read this thread (though this comment will probably be further down) None of this shit really matters long term. You are worth more than your ability to attract people. There are more things about yourself you could concern yourself with.	14 when girls in my class were gossiping, about the guys they'd date and my name popped up, followed by an "Ew never."
What was the hottest way you were surprised by your SO for sex?	I have two. 1) I came home from school late one night in December. She was on the bed dressed up as a sexy elf with candy cane thigh highs and red heels. 2) I got home from work and opened the door to her bending over cleaning the house in a sexy maid outfit and heels. We were expecting company within 15 minutes for a big party. They ended up waiting outside for a hour and a half until we were finished.	She had just gotten a Mirena and we had bareback sex for the first time. It was incredible. Anyway, at some point I was about to cum, and realized I hadn't asked yet, so I ask if she wants me to pull out. Y'know, to be on the safe side. She said no and pulled me closer. Wasn't expecting that, since we did have a pregnancy scare or two with condoms. Needless to say, I came seconds later.
Do you sometimes feel as though your looks don't accurately reflect who you are deep down?	Outside: Resting bitching face. Inside: Funny scenarios and one-liners are going on along with a myriad of LSD/marijuana-esque state of mind. I'm so weird.	Im 6 foot 3 and 250 lbs and old as dirt (67). I was very fit except I had bad bones from years of prednisone for Crohns disease so I was always in pain and walked like I was drunk most of the time. I used to blow my sons minds by doing 50 pull ups in my gun belt or going sit up for sit up with my grandson, but don't ask me to walk anywhere! Oh well I got my new hip now and soon I get the next one and then I get metal knees! Grandpa 2.0
Men, how old were you when you finally figured out what you wanted to do in life?	18 . It didn't require a lot of thought either. It just came out of nowhere and I have loved it ever since.	I'm 50 and I'll just sit here in the corner and see if I get any ideas from this thread.
How many of you are happily willing to financially support a woman that you love?	I don't see myself ever making enough money to support a family by myself. I'm afraid of getting divorced because alimony will be a lot if I have a housewife. I'd rather be the one getting supported. So any wife of mine will have to be gainfully employed. Housewife just isn't for me. I'd make an exception if I somehow come into a LOT of money. I'm talking millions.	Personally, I don't want to be the sole financial "breadwinner". Obviously if it comes down to me taking the lion's share of the burden, I'm willing to put in the effort to keep us afloat, but if I were to have a career setback or jump, I would expect my wife, who I see as an equal partner in this arrangement, to then take up the mantle.
Childless bachelorettes over 35: How sweet is your life?	40/F here. Hubby and I have a great marriage, going on 18 childfree years. We have a lively little Husky puppy, who is the light of our lives. We also have a lot of very supportive family and friends.	Almost 35. Life is fine. Very few bills, lots of freedom and time. Traveling is my biggest hobby asides from photography. I don't like to stay in a place for too long. I also value my peace and quiet so it's nice to wake up and take naps whenever I want.
How did you get over your "I'm not like other girls" phase?	What does that even mean? I'm not like the socially hyped image of the girly-girl who loves to shop and fusses with her makeup and nails, and only thinks about guys and gossip. Does that make me not like other girls? Most of my friends are not like that either. What does your question actually mean?	I don't know really. I grew up, got more life experience, got to know more girls, had more diverse friendgroups, etc.
Ladies, what is one thing your boyfriend does that you absolutely love?	He's not my boyfriend yet, but the guy I've been seeing is hilarious. If I'm ever in a position where he can see my butt, he will grab it and then start biting all over, just little love bites. It always makes me giggle and scream and I love it.	My husband regularly will pop up in bed in the middle of the night,kiss me and tell me he loves me,then pass right back out. He never remembers it in the morning. Always makes me smile.
Would you ever get plastic surgery? Why not/What would you get?	Honestly, recently I've been feeling a bit like a victim of the body positivity movement taken too far. I'm all for supporting women feeling comfortable with themselves, but I feel at times like there's social stigma attached to not being comfortable with something. Especially when you experience actual negative effects or social consequences for "not fitting" the expected mold, you can want to do some about it, and I've felt like considering the possibility of surgery has been a tough one for me because I think there's a pervasive message that women who get elective surgery are upholding the patriarchy and unreasonable beauty standards and should be expected to just "love themselves" and thereby not have to deal with any negativity from other people.	As soon as I had financial means to do so, I went in for a procedure. It helped my self-image immensely. There's a big difference between "correcting" an unattractive feature and renovating one's entire body. The urge to go back again and again is a red flag. Responsible doctors should be able to prevent people in an obsessive or bad state of mental health from getting multiple procedures.
Have you ever gotten “bad vibes” from a friend’s SO? Did you tell your friend? Were you ever proven right or wrong?	Pretty much exclusively. I've never met a friend's boyfriend or girlfriend that I've approved of. By like the fourth person, I stopped saying anything. I can only think of one time I was proven wrong. He wasn't a bad guy, he just wasn't right for her.	Yes, but I didn't say anything overt to her because I knew she wouldn't hear it. He ended up being a rank nasty creep who cheated on her (truly amazing that he managed to find two women to think he was worth giving even the time of day) and since she's moved on she's been really good about seeking perspectives on shitty behavior and actually doing something about it. I'm proud of her.
If you have an air purifier in your home, what differences have you noticed in health &amp; has it been worth it?	I think living in a too clean environment is pretty terrible idea if you don't have any serious allergies or asthma where you would want to alleviate your symptoms. I grew up drinking boiled filtered water (my dad is OCD like that), whenever I drink any tap water I get the shits... I live in a country where the tap water is very clean to drink and everybody drinks from the tap and they are fine, not me.	I'm in an area that gets forest fires so it really helps to keep the house feeling fresh when outside feels like stepping into a camp fire. Outside that, it helps a lot with allergies.
What's the most hungover you've ever been?	The most I've ever been hungover was the first time I sipped on alcohol. I definitely wasn't truly hungover, but in a way, that was the most hungover I've ever been.	When I was much younger I drank for around seven hours one evening/night, had about an hours' sleep and then staggered to work. I threw up in the sink as soon as I got to work but managed to start working - until I farted. I followed through (shit myself), the smell of which made me puke again. I passed out in the toilet for about 20 minutes, then just staggered home again without telling anyone.
Do any of you not watch porn? If so, why?	I don't. I disagree with a lot of it ethically, and if I am feeling hiring I just have sex with my SO anyhow. I don't personally need to watch other people fucking for variety or whatever. Edit: thought I was in askwomen but whatever. Still applies.	I try to watch as little as possible. Right now, it is around once every 10 days. Although my sexlife was never terrible, i have found that cutting porn and masturbation to as little as possible has really improved my sexlife. I now experience way more powerful orgasms, and i never have trouble going 'full mast' due to being more turned on. Before, i had trouble finishing, but those days are over. Condoms used to be a big problem for me, but now i can both maintain my erection and finish. Of course, i still prefer to go sans condom, but now it is not as much of a problem.. All in all, i have been really satisfied with my decision, and i hope that i can kick the habit completely, at some point.
Ladies who have gotten out of a toxic relationship, how did you do it?	I pried to God to send me a sign/something which give me the ability to say : game over. The next day, the thing happened. And then I refused any contact (phone, visit, etc?) from that person for at least 1 month. It worked. Thanks, God! I believe God exists and if we really really want something, it will happen.	I was with a horrible guy in my teens, super emotionally abusive. At some point, his jealousy got so bad that I physically screamed when I recieved one of his texts and I threw my phone against the wall. So out of character for me. I then thought, it's been three years and he brings out the absolute worst in me. I stopped responding but I won't lie - it took *years* to fix the mental damage he did to me. Last year I started dating a guy, but saw the same signs... The jealousy, the gas-lighting (along with an alcohol problem). I'm older now, smarter, I can see the signs and I've worked too hard on myself to go down that road again. I ended it after three months.
What simple comfort pleasures do you indulge in that may have deeper, darker memories attached to them?	I'm obsessed with gilmore girls, I've watched too many times to count. I think I like it so much because I wanted my mom to show me she cared too.	I remember when I was a smoker I loved the smell. It reminded me of my father who had passed when I was young. I remember going to his family’s house and everyone would be sitting together in the living room enjoying a cigarette. It really comforts me whenever I smell cigarettes. Unfortunately it made it rather hard to kick the habit. But whenever I see a pack I always think of my dad and his family. It gives me a deep sense of nostalgia.

Alright guys what was a giant red flag you encountered early on, but still went with it? How'd that go?	Fuck her a few times with a rubber on and then bail. And make sure they are your rubbers and not hers. Crazy bitches do crazy things but they fuck like monsters.	"Man, her whole family is fucking insanely bat-shit crazy. Trashy, narcissistic, unreasonable, undisciplined, entitled. I can't understand how she came from those people and yet is nothing like them!" Yeah, whoops.
How happy are you with your physical appearance, and do you think "society" and "the media" have played a part in your views?	Not particularly happy that the apex of male beauty is either lumberjack guy or Matt Bomer(no one can reach this man's good looks. Not natural) Meanwhile the guy that's trying to get in shape so he doesn't have a stroke at 48 like his mother, avoid familial diabetes and high blood pressure, gets the "you should get in shape then women will want you". I'm not saying I shouldn't get in shape but why only then will women want a guy/or women in some cases. Isn't that a little vain? "Oh now you are acceptable to notice" type of thing?	Eh, not entirely happy. I think the media has played a role in how I think people look without makeup vs how they actually look. I'm alright with my body shape for the most part; it's how I look without makeup and general flaws like unwanted hair or blemishes.
Have you ever given flowers to a man, and if so what was his reaction?	Nope, I find that absolutely pointless. Why should I give someone something that literally dies within a week. I’d rather let it live and give them something they can actually put to use	I recently gave my dad sunflowers for Father’s Day. I expected him to be like “I’m a man, yuck,” but he immediately put them in water, took a bunch of pictures of them, and sent them to all of his friends. It was really sweet.
Where is it okay to ask out a woman, other than the bar?	if youre average looking and with good style and grooming. anywhere really. but this takes practice and lots of confidence. on top of this ,if youre also a naturally introverted guy like me, then its going to be difficult. feel free to pm me if interested to talk more about this.	Anywhere but context matters. For instance, striking up a conversation with someone on the street and at the end of the conversation asking if she’d want to meet up for coffee is different than yelling “will you go out with me” to a woman that’s walking by. It’s just a matter of paying attention to the context. If someone’s appears busy going about their day, interrupting them with the intention of asking them out may not work out too well. If someone’s at place where people go to socialize, you’re probably okay striking up a conversation with them and then seeing how things go
What "culture(s)" do you despise?	The fucking mainstream media. They are such biased non thinking pieces of shit. Their defense of Hillary Clintons lies and illegal activities disgusts me. Instead of addressing the allegations being thrown at her, they reflexively dismiss the attacks and attempt to discredit the attackers. The classic "no true Scotsman" fallacy - the idea that since they think republicans are all assholes, that everything they say is wrong. Edit: I don't watch Fox News. I'm basing my views on actual events I witnessed on other networks like CBS, CNN, CNBC. It's clear to any objective observer that these networks have the default assumption that democrats are well intentioned and correct, and republicans have bad intentions and are incorrect. Regardless of the facts. There is sometimes no discussion of the facts by the anchor/reporter, they just disagree because of distrust.	"Prank Culture" this idea that pranks aren't funny unless someone's person or personal belongings are damaged. I saw a video the other day of a guy slapping random strangers on the back of the head and claiming it was a prank, no you're just an asshole who documented himself being an asshole
That eternally single friend of yours - what's keeping you from setting them up?	Playing match maker is a huge cultural taboo here. If someone wants to find love they have to do it alone and on their own.	He is a fairly abusive person. He can't see it in himself and doesn't want to go to therapy to resolve his problems. He's unhappy being single which only multiplies his underlying issues while ensuring no woman would come within a hundred feet of him romantically.
Is anyone else super excited that Wendy Davis won the democratic primary and is running for Governor in Texas? Are there any other women you are excited to see run for office this year (wherever you are)?	Davis won't win. She has been outed as a compulsive liar whose "life story" is a complete fabrication. Don't see how you could be excited to have that type of person in charge.	This won't mean much to anyone outside of Toronto, but I am desperately hoping Olivia Chow wins instead of Rob Ford this October. It seems tragically unlikely though.

How many things from porn have you tried in real life? Did you crash and burn or was it better than expected?	Porn is real life too, those are real people really fucking. I don't really see a distinction between porn and real life. I think I've tried pretty much everything that looked hot to me in porn, with some exceptions that I'm just not strong enough to do (fucking someone while also carrying them, lifting them up with one hand, etc) With some partners it went more or less the same as it was in the porn, with other partners not. Everyone has different limitations, people with fewer physical and psychological limitations can pretty much do it exactly like it is in porn if they so choose.	Bounced my dick on an ex's cheek once cause I saw it in porn. She just kind of looked at me and I just looked at her and said "I don't know what I thought that was gonna do." I guess it worked out because we had a good laugh about it. Another ex wanted to see what all the hype about oily tits was about so we tried it out. It looked ridiculous, but they felt amazing. She rubbed them on my dick and we found out that was a move for when she was ready for me to finish. That one came from watching porn and I would say it was a success.
What's your favorite example of fake dating/sex advice?	"Getting bangs is just an if-then algorithm. If you open a set with a neg, you then proceed with a cocky-funny approach. Always bust on her, never answer a question with a straight answer. She'll drop her pants in no time. It's like the Konami Kode for girls."	ITT: dont listen to women for dating advice because they date men, not other women That actually makes sense. Although...I wonder if people asked Lesbians for dating advice, would it be helpful? Because they date and sleep with other women, just like straight men.
Single woman in your 30s, how do you comfort yourself when you crave affection from a partner?	My husband is a drug addict. Heroin. I want to leave so bad but I’m afraid of being 30 with two cats. I’m also not as thin as I was in my 20’s and what if I’m not as compatible with anyone else. I wish I was as strong as you single ladies.	One thing my dad taught me is that you can give yourself love and the comfort you desire. That moment there's an automatic switch that no one can love me and take care of me the way I do. So when a man enters my life he better be sweeter than solitude.
Men with the lower libido in a relationship: what ways have you found to compromise and work through it together?	Depends on why he is anti-sex. For me I think full sessions are fucking exhausting and I am lazy. Once a week is plenty. Foreplay is nigh effortless though so my SOs never go wanting. See if he'll go down on you or jam some fingers or toys in you every day.	What worked for my fiance and I is just to do sex acts... not necessarily PIV sex. Hands do more for me anyways and it's more of him giving me pleasure out of the goodness of his heart rather than having to spend the energy and try to hold the erection, etc. He fiddles me, I cum in his arms, and it's done. If he gets in the mood from it, all the better, but I won't ask that of him.

do you enjoy going on dates or do you do it just to get the girl, please explain why is or isn't fun?	I genuinely like meeting new people and trying new bars/restaurants/activities, so I generally enjoy dating. Bad dates are cringe at the time, but always make for a good story afterwards, so even that can be pretty fun. Mediocre, boring dates are actually worse, when you think about how you could have done your laundry that night instead...	I hate first dates. I love when you are like 3 months in and it is still honeymoon phase but you feel a lot more comfortable just staying in and watching a movie.
What is a small thing your SO does that drives you up the wall?	ITT: Lots and lots of things I'd bring up with my SO in a calm manner because we like not doing things that annoy the other person.	When we clean together he'll always gravitate towards the non-essential jobs. I'll come down from cleaning the bathrooms to find him organizing DVDs alphabetically. Really? Generally I ignore it but if his parents are coming to town (mother is super-clean nazi and will start cleaning my home if she thinks it isn't clean enough), I can get pretty upset.
Girls: what things guys like to do to each other that you don't understand and hate?	"Just joke around". No, you're pretending it's "just joking" for some kind of asinine masculinity-proving bullshit. This is why you never discuss any of your feelings and problems with your male "friends" and dump it all on me and other women in your life.	Guys never compliment or are never affectionate with each other. I see a lot of men here are upset that they never get complimented but 90% of my compliments are from other women. Its like their afraid of being seen as gay.
Men of Reddit, what is it like to have a dick and balls?	At the very least having male genitalia makes it more difficult to get sex. So many more hurdles to go through just for a hookup. A guy has to have game, a semblance of looks and can still be shut out depending on the whims of the woman in question.	>Any struggles Random boners happen. Mostly when you can't use 'em. >benefits No menstruation. *It's also like a built in water gun. Destroying a urinal cake is as satisfying as the other side of the pillow. >inside jokes If I laid my dick on your keyboard it'd go all the way from A to Z.
Posted something similar on AskWomen: Guys, what is an attractive trait in women that is undervalued by them, and what is an unattractive trait that is overvalued?	Undervalued: Being skinny Overvalued: Fashion accessories Seriously, though, fat makes a girl drop off the dating radar. Lurking fat people can upvote "being skinny" all they like, but it won't change my preferences.	for me at least, punctuality (no idea if it's *actually* undervalued or not) is really attractive to me. I'm a dude who tries to run like clockwork. If I say I'm going to or told to be somewhere at X time, you better understand that I'm probably going to be early. If we're planning to leave somewhere at a certain time, we're leaving as close to that time as we can. If a girl is always late then I find it a little rude and somewhat inconsiderate. Maybe I'm a little too wound up, but I like being efficient and in my mind, it makes things run smoother.
People who have sworn off love, what's made you do it?	I say that I have, but I think it's got more to do with my high standards. For me to consider someone as a potential long-term partner, she needs to be at least a 7/10, be intelligent, capable of conversations about a wide range of topics, have relatively fair skin, be no taller than 5'3", and weigh no more than 135lbs. So a very specific type. This of course only applies to those I would consider viable girlfriends, not just someone I find attractive enough to sleep with.	Manipulative and emotional abusive ex and the aftermath I'm still dealing with from that. Not sworn it off for good, but who knows when I'll let someone close enough and allow myself to feel love again.
What has an ex ruined for you?	I take the reverse question: What I (a dude) ruined for my ex? Her Master's Thesis. She cheated on, and dumped me, but forgot to download the latest copy of her MT from my laptop. She tried to recreate the several missing chapters, but could not do it without my help, and the notes left on my computer, so just gave up. last time Ive heard of her, she ended up working as a telemarketter for a bank/insurance agency. The jury is split on whether this makes me the worst person in the history of men-kind, or if it was a rightous retribution.	My backyard. After we broke up he decided to move 3000 miles across the country, to the town I moved to, and began to date my next door neighbor. I basically share a backyard with her, but he swears it's a coincidence.
What compliment did you receive that you knew was not true?	Have not had anyone compliment on something that is not true, i am kind of perfect and people don't really complement me enough. My cooking is on par with the world top chefs. My looks are the definition of the golden ration of beauty. My driving skills are better than professional drivers. My personality is a mix of all the saints that have lived. I could brake every world record in any sport if i had the time for it. And i could answer every question science can come up with if i would not be so busy saving damsels in distress from dragons and evil knights.	Bro walked in while i was making dinner. He smiled and said "something smells good"i then showed him all i had done up until then was boil water.
What’s a weird food combo you made up as a kid and still love as an adult?	I don’t think it’s wired but cut up cut up. It’s of bacon, boil spaghetti noodles, mix. Definitely a long standing drunk food as well.	My sister and I used to dunk Hot Cheetos in sour cream cuz they were too spicy. Now I dunk em cuz it tastes delicious.

What's an 'oh shit' moment where you realised you've been doing something the wrong way for years?	When I was probably about 8 or 9, I found that if I rub my penis on things it would get a nice feeling... that I liked, years later I was still rubbing or humping my penis on stuff including pillows, a mattress, my old sponge bob the square pants stuffed animal pillow, my arm, the corner of a chair in class (elementary school). I didn’t figure out the right way till late middle school....	44 years old. Just realized this year that you can pee in a swimsuit by just pulling the crotch to the side rather than wrestling a wet swimsuit all the way down and back up again.
Have you ever tried to be sexy, only to somehow fail miserably?	A girl once told me she made out with Girl the last time she was drink because it was a dare. My response was that ive never drank because i don't see the point in consuming something that causes someone to lose control of their actions.	My boyfriend once asked in a sexy voice, "would you like to remove your sweater?" i burst out laughing. He got embarrassed. It's now a joke between us
Do you ever feel like your general sense of happiness is directly connected to your current body size?	I'm a lot happier fat than I ever was skinny. I mean back then I could enjoy delicious trashy food with reckless abandon, but literally everything else is better now. It's entirely possible I could be even happier, but I'm not convinced that would come from losing weight.	I am a fat girl. I hate the word fat, but it's the word to describe me. I am lazy. Fat people tend to be lazy. I was much skinnier at one point in my life. I lost 50 pounds and I was generally happier in life. Motivation makes me happy. So I definitely think my size correlates with my happiness. I am not saying I am depressed and that I am not happy. I am a happy person, but I could be happier.
Has anyone ever done a sleep study?	I tried to get a sleep study done as well because I did have horrible issues with sleeping. When I saw the doctor, he told me that my sleeping had less to do with sleeping issues like sleep apnea or narcolepsy, and more to do with my mood (like depression). I'm not sure if all sleep studies are similar, but he basically said I couldn't do the sleep study because I didn't have a sleeping disorder as mentioned above. Do you think you have a sleeping disorder (like falling asleep during inappropriate times, sleep walking, trouble breathing when sleeping, etc.) or do you think it has to do with your mood or lifestyle? I still did struggle with my sleeping issues, but I think it helped as my mood became better and my depression seemed to "go away".	I did this past August. Turns out I've had sleep apnea for most of my life but it was never diagnosed, to the point that I wasn't breathing for most of the time spent asleep. I also had major tonsil issues that were affecting my breathing, particularly at night. I was given a CPAP machine and it's been incredible. I can't even imagine how much sleep I've missed out on in the past few years. The mask is annoying, and it's super unsexy, but I actually sleep through the night now. Especially with my tonsils gone. I'd say to do the study just in case.
What stereotype about women do you conform to?	I love love love make-up, I'm seriously emotional at times, and I was in a sorority... And I have an English degree, which I always assumed was really feminine. And I love dresses and heels way more than I should. And babies. I want all of the babies. But I also like superheros (and cosplay), attempt to use logic over reason, and have been kicking ass and taking names in Math classes since I was young.	* I own way more clothes and shoes than any one person could possibly need * The Twilight movies are my worst guilty pleasure and IDGAF who knows anymore * I constantly anthropomorphize animals and objects when I think they're cute * I scream and run away from most bugs * While I don't *love* it, I get a lot of satisfaction out of cooking/cleaning/caring for my SOs * I have perfected the skill of being friendly and polite in person to people I can't fucking stand; most people I actively dislike don't have a clue that I dislike them at all * I have had a legitimate chocolate emergency before wherein I ordered $25 of chocolate and paid $12 to have it delivered to me within 2 hours via Amazon Prime Now at 11PM
Guys who have dated a woman (or guy) that all your friends and family hated, how did that turn out? Are you still together? Did you lose friends?	I never gave a fuck, because it's not their life and they never see or understand the full picture. I never lost anyone from this, or at least anyone I actually cared about.	Broke up with her. When everyone tells you she isn't good for you and tells you she's a bitch, maybe your blinders are on. Years later I see her as just a person on occasion and she is kind of a bitch to everyone.
What is your opinion of Trigger Warnings?	I think it's hilarious how the people who get so offended by them are the ones who are all "if you can't handle it don't go on the internet!!!!1!!!1 2edgy4u".	The politically correct side of me thinks that a trigger warning is easy to do and shouldn't be a big deal. But the other side of me thinks that a vast majority of people abuse it, and it casts a bad light on actual PTSD sufferers. Case in point: TW food, TW diet, TW spiders. I mean I don't like moths, but seeing a moth isn't going to ruin my entire day. I think, especially with teenagers, there is a certain vogue surrounding being damaged, and unnecessary trigger warnings allow people to win the Damaged Olympics.
What does it take for you to feel desired/loved by a woman?	To be left the fuck alone every now and again and not have to discuss how I'm feeling. I'd like this to occur with no prompting or arguments	When she says she loves me. When she wants to be near me and touch me. When she puts her head on my shoulder, lap or chest.
What do you wish your parents had done differently when raising you?	I wish they would've made me read more. I can only imagine what my vocabulary would've been like had I spent more time reading book than watching pointless TV shows.	I slightly wish there was more emphasis on physical activity and healthy eating--or at least that we had done more together as a family. I would never put all the blame on my parents instead of myself, but if I'd grown up with more models of physical activity=fun!, I might not be quite as fat and lazy as I am now. Maybe. I don't know.
Guys, how do you feel when a girl approach you and asks you out?	Excuse me? A woman approaching a man? What is this kind of unicorn and where can I find her? I would love it if a woman approached me, just once, ever. But maybe I am ugly :(	If you like the guy, do it. Too many guys would love to be asked by a woman bc many others complain they have to do all the job and read the signals. So, yeah. Go for it.
Fathers, what are some important pieces of advice you would give to a daughter?	Stay away from feminism and the 'strong, independent woman' rhetoric. Embrace your femininity and cultivate grace. Take personal responsibility and accountability in everything that you do. Develop insight and the ability to be introspective about the choices that you make in the short term and the long term. Good/great men exist. Perfect men do not. Men and women aren't adversarial or equal but a great compliment to each other. Stay in good shape and take pride in your appearance.	I would say one thing would be to learn basic car mechanics stuff so you won’t be stranded somewhere over a flat tire or get ripped off at a mechanics shop.
What's the cutest thing your SO ever did for you?	It's really just the way he's opened his heart and home to me. How he told me he loved me. How he doesn't let a day go by without saying it and showing it.	In the beginning of our relationship, he tried to plan a perfect date all catered to me, and it went horribly wrong. Tried to go to my favorite restaurant - it was closed. Tried to go watch sunset on the beach - it was a cloudy day. Tried to redeem himself and take me to movies - car broke down. But he tried so hard and he was so nervous, sweaty, and bummed that it all didn't pan out that I knew he was the one haha been together for 8 years now. The one with the clammy hands and red ear tips from embarrassment? That one's mine, ladies haha
How to deal with a friend who lies all the time?	Ok I'll explain this one the best way i can because i do it too, even some of my friends do it. It isn't because they are bragging. It is a way of telling a good story. For instance, If i just tell you i went to the supermarket its boring, but if i were to tell you about something funny or awkward that happened its more interesting. Go look at a couple of stand up comedians they do the same thing. Its their way of giving an entertaining perspective on an otherwise boring story.	OP, I had a friend who had a similar problem growing up. I would always just roll with it, because, what the hell, wasn't a big deal, right? Well, eventually I got sick of it. I went to town on him and brought up a bunch of his lies, telling him that I knew that he was lying and it really bothered me. I told him I was his friend no matter what and if he wanted to lie to other people, fine, but he was never to lie to me again. We had a huge falling out over it and it was awkward for about 6 months. Then we got over it and he hasn't lied to me since. Sometimes, straight up confronting a problem is the only way to fix it.
Do any of you NOT work out? How do you feel about it?	I usually do not work out. I feel fine about it because I am thin and pretty healthy anyway. Sometimes I think it would be nice to put on some muscle, but I would struggle too much to eat at a calorie surplus, so meh.	I am currently not working out. I hate working out, and often I'll go force myself to do it because it's good for my health. But it's really never something I start to _enjoy_ and minor things such as it being too hot or cold out, or a schedule change, will cause me to stop. I am generally happier when I don't have to go work out honestly.
(X-post from AskMen) What are some basic things that people can upgrade in their life that they might not have thought of?	* comfy pillows * A long phone charger * Kitchen equipment (A good quality knife and some good quality pans can change your world) * Some spices/seasonings. My boyfriend bought us a little herb rack that came with 18 or so little bottles or different herbs/seasonings/spices. Changed our cooking completely. * A really nice mug * A good quality umbrella * Comfy, good quality shoes. * A coat that keeps you warm and dry * Wireless headphones * A dehumidifier. We have a mini one that you can put oils in. Makes the house smell incredible. * Nice underwear. * A well fitting bra. (If you haven't gotten fitted in a while please go and get fitted) * Toilet paper * A bus pass	a high quality chef's knife will making cooking a lot less stressful than the cheap block set someone gave you when you got your first apartment.
Guys who got into fitness/dieting, did you get pushback from friends or family? What was the most ridiculous comment you've heard?	Do you live in an area that's mostly unhealthy/overweight/obese people? I've only ever gotten support and compliments after working out.	Always get the "you're getting too muscular" and "dieting and working out doesn't necessarily make you healthy" stuff off them, they're always telling me "you don't have to diet today it's the weekend" so I can eat a lot of bs... this is just coming from my parents and other family members. Then they complain about how they're fat just because they eat and how they feel self-conscious eating around me but yet how confident and happy they feel because they can eat whatever and not care about how they look. They constantly try to rub in my face the "freedom" they have from being careless.
Women who can orgasm during sex, what's some tips for the sexually challenged to get us there??	Know that its literally impossible for some women to orgasm during PIV sex, that this is perfectly normal, and that it does not in any way remove from your value as a sexual being! I highly recommend the book 'come as you are' by Emily Nagoski. Its important to remove the focus from attaining orgasm and redirect it to experiencing pleasure!	Know what gets you off. Know your body. Masturbate every single way until you figure out what makes you come and then tell your partner precisely how to do it. Then practice the hell out of it.
Ladies who lift weights, whats the best/worst thing about it?	Worst: Pelvic Organ Prolapse. Ladies, if you have had a vaginal birth, be aware that not all exercises that were designed for men are appropriate for women.	Best thing: Feel strong and powerful. Seeing muscle definition. Eating more and not being underweight anymore. Worst thing: Sports and normal bras just seem to be getting tighter and I need to buy new ones often. Clothes that used to fit don't anymore. Also, hamstring doms are the worst.
Mothers of Reddit, what’s the funniest/stupidest reason that made you cry during pregnancy?	*Just FYI, not all mothers have experienced pregnancy, and not all who've experienced pregnancy are mothers. Sorry sorry, it's just a thing of mine.* Also, literal spilled milk. I was laughing at myself for crying, and my SO was laughing so hard that he was crying, too. It was the best and the worst.	I dropped my very last chicken nugget on the floor. My husband offered to buy me more and I cried harder bc “I can’t eat that many.” I was a mess.
Caught my nipple while vigorously combing my hair last night. What dumb way have you hurt yourself recently?	I have huge boobs, and after scrolling through reddit naked with my laptop on my ribs, I slammed my screen on my nipple. My s.o. saw me do it. I will never live it down.	Just last week I was exercising with my Wii console. Well my shoe got catch on the carpet and I twisted my ankle, pulled my knee, and pulled the muscle that is between my thigh and pelvis. It was made worse by the wii person going "Don't give up now!" while I was crying on the floor.
Ladies, what useful/memorable piece of relationship advice do you swear by?	It's not how he treats his mother, it's how his *father* treated his mother, that's how he's going to treat you (ultimately).	My dad once told me 'if you don't want your son to grow up like him, he's not the one'.... It's so obvious, but it took hearing those words out loud to get it to sink in.
Guys who's wives are still crazy over you, what's your secret?	I married a virgin. We also really liked each other as people from day one. And we talked for about 3 months every day before we became sexual. And I'm not a loser. I work through my problems, stay in great shape, admit when I'm wrong, and dont think I'm the shit.	He never stopped doing the small goofy stuff to make me smile. Last week, I turned on the ceiling fan and a bar of chocolate came sailing down from one of the blades. He gets super excited if he has a surprise for me, standing on his toes, and I know it's because he's excited for my reaction. He's always trying to make my life a little brighter, and it never fails to make my heart melt. And it's not just the fun stuff. If he sees me starting to do the dishes, he'll jump in to help without being asked.
What is the funniest porn plot you've seen?	Due to an inherent lack of self esteem, I'd say any porn where the girl wants sex. I imagine shes doing it for the money, is forced to do it, is a crack addict, or has massive daddy issues. Under no scenario do I see women engaging in porn sex by desire or the pleasure principle without the guy tricking her into it somehow.	There was one that was made to look like an old kung fu movie, complete with the grainy video, and being in Chinese, subtitled in English. A naked guy and girl were fighting, flying around through the trees, and would catch each other in weird, acrobatic sex positions and yell out the names of them. It ended when the guy yelled "Ejaculation!" then pyrotechnics went off, and launched the girl across the forest.
Ladies, how do you deal with not being 'pretty'?	Hello ladies, im a guy and can i just say that if you have something strongly in common you could be the most unattractive person physically and i am more attracted to you than anything. For example, today i talked to some fellow computer science students whom were female. I dont think they were the most physically attractive, but because i could talk to them about complex, geeky stuff that we computer nerds like - that the average female may get bored of or not understand -i was instantly attracted to them. Just something to think about maybe? Sorry if it was stupid. But if you have something in common that you do daily, its a major turn on! More so than anyone who has a *pretty face*.	Fellow not-attractive person here! I deal with it by just accepting it, and in turn accepting that it really does not matter in the grand scheme of things. It's natural to be jealous of others, and there's nothing really to be done about that. It's good to find people who you can relate to and who won't dismiss you. I know I'm kind of ugly, sometimes it sucks, I want to be able to vent without being told 'oh no, you're not ugly at all!' Like, dude. Here's a really great video on the subject: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2js063a1Suk
Old men of Reddit: What was the key to your successful marriage?	Woman here with a general comment. A lot of you are mentioning romance (including sexy time and just together time). For me, vulgarity is the opposite of romance. I can't seem to make my husband understand that, while I'm not a prude, distasteful and crude language will ensure no sex for at least two days because it completely turns me off. Not just off sex, but I don't want to even hang out with him because I am truly disgusted. So please guys, know your woman!! A lot of women would not give two shits about this, but I do, and I bet I'm not alone here.	When arguing with your SO, the goal isn't to win the argument. The goal is to solve a problem. Nobody is a fucking mind reader, so don't go to your SO with *you should know why I'm upset* bullshit. If you're doing things to intentionally hurt your SO, you're an idiot. The strongest relationships come from two strong, happy individuals coming together, not two broken individuals relying on each other for happiness.
Women who've lived in multiple cultures where dating/sex/love was treated differently, what have your experiences been like?	I haven't lived in different cultures, but my mom is from a different culture and had tried to push her cultural beliefs on to me. Things like "don't start looking for a husband until your 20s." Just that sentence alone shows what kind of differences there are. It's made my life difficult because my mother is very nosy and controlling and thinks any way but hers is wrong.	I was pleasantly surprised in New Zealand. Not only are people there more upfront about sex, but there's not a lot of "pretending to be roommates" or sleeping in separate beds when you visit your parents for appearances sake. I also got a much more casual picture of the dating scene. If you like someone, you ask them out. There's not quite as much dithering about and thinking *omg my life will end if she doesn't like me back...* And guys didn't act emasculated if women did the asking.
Past my 30ies since a few months, why do i suddenly feel so pressured?	because mid life crisis: where you feel like time is running out, and you never had all the big boxes ticked or you didnt get to do all the things you wanted to when you were younger.	Short answer is 30 is a big milestone that insidiously forces you to compare yourself to other 30 y/os who already have white picket fences, careers, spouses, etc.
Have you ever had something happen to you (good or bad) that made you rethink your entire personality or identity?	When I learned I had Complex PTSD and what an emotional flashback was I gained a huge insight into my personality. The same was true when I learned what dysphoria was years ago. Now I realize how much both emotional flashbacks from my childhood abuse and the pain from gender dysphoria have "guided" my personality throughout my life since early childhood. I don't think "rethink" is a good word for it. I think "understand" is a better word for it. Knowledge truly is power, and having words for what I am going through and to realize its already been study in depth makes me feel very empowered. I can see better truly who am I outside an emotional flashback, and the varying ways my persona shifts when in an emotional flashback. Fight, flight, freeze, and fawn all display different behaviors with me.	I'd been taking medication/receiving treatment for depression and bipolar disorder for almost 12 years when my psychiatrist suddenly died in 2013. I was unable to find another doctor accepting new patients that took my insurance and I couldn't afford the intake appointment for the ones that didn't. When I ultimately decided I'd just see what happened if I stopped taking anything, I realized I had no idea what I was like without it. I ***definitely do not*** recommend doing this, as it could have ended extremely poorly, but it ended up being very positive for me.
What are some "green flags" to look out for when dating?	There are none. Any good attribute can be faked, or coexist with nasty attributes that make it unworkable. All you can do is keep an eye out for the bad shit *and hope there isn't any hiding beneath a passable facade.	She asks questions back to you when you're talking to them. I've found that girls who don't do that are usually selfish people.
Gentleman, is your SO the "hottest" woman you've ever dated? If not, what is it about them that it just so much more of an attraction to you?	I would say both of my SOs are, in their own way. They're very different women, it's like comparing different flavors of ice cream.	I'm pretty binary when it comes to my SO's looks. Either a woman is good looking enough for me to date or she isn't. Once she falls into the "good enough" bin, I only care about their personality. I don't think a "super hot" woman would make me happier in the long run than a "normally attractive" woman. Having said all that, My SO's are generally not the hottest women I've dated.
How do you feel towards pink tools marketed towards women?	The only way I'd see this to be a good idea is if the money goes to a cancer foundation. Aside from that, I find it completely degrading to women (I'm a man chiming in). There are a ton of women who work trades and construction, why should they have tools that define women? There's just something so fantastic about a woman wielding a DeWalt power tool, it's just so exciting to watch.	I would LOVE for tools to come in more colors. If I could get my tool box in a rainbow, I totally would. But just pink? That feels like pandering. And I bet a lot of dudes would think it was pretty cool to be able to pick what colors their handles are too. You could even do something like all your metric ratchets are blue and all your imperial are green. Practical!
Its usually guys doing things to impress women; what's something a woman has done that has impressed you?	Not much, but I don't mind, women are not conditioned to try to impress men. Women pursue impressive things for their own enrichment.	Had a tough time at uni a few years ago during exams and told the girl I liked at the time (who’d just finished a paper herself) about it. A few hours later, I get a phone call from her asking me to come downstairs (she lived in another apartment building a 10-minute walk away from me). I meet her downstairs and she gives me a box of brownies she’d baked which she brought over just to cheer me up. We never had a relationship, but I’m always gonna remember that gesture for the rest of my life as one of the sweetest things anyone’s ever done for me, in more ways than one.
What is your take on the spreadsheet husband?	Seems like misplaced effort to me. I'm curious, he lists all her "excuses", but he doesn't say how he approached her for sex. Sometimes you gotta put a little effort into seduction, even if you are a long term couple. And of course an email before leaving town is amazingly childish. I know we're only getting her side, but sounds like dude clearly has communication issues.	I think that it was a last, desperate attempt to get a point across. If this were the first time he brought it up, I'd say it was a massively passive aggressive move on his part. However, if this was an ongoing thing, I can undertsand it. Not how I'd deal with it, but I can understand it. I can easily imagine the husabnd saying things along the lines of "why do you always turn me down?" and answered with "You're exaggerating, stop making things up!" Bottom line, I'd need WAY more information before making a judgement call on it, but It doesn't take much to imagine a struggling relationship where this becomes a "reasonable" response to one partner or another. I see this is a red flag for a relationship in trouble. Period.
Is taking a break in a relationship healthy? Would anyone recommend it?	Translated from girlspeak: "I am at the peak of my lifetime beauty and sexual value. I want to fuck lots of other guys. Bye."	Translation: I think I can do better than you. If not we'll get back together in the future because I couldn't find any other options.
What is your destination for the trip of your dreams, and why?	My destination is my bed and my dreams that involve an orgy with Tilda Swinton, Tom Hiddleston, All the Chris's minus Pine, Scarlett Johansson and AppleBach McGillersash.	New Zealand to see all the filming locations from Lord of the rings! SO and I started dating due to our mutual interest in it and we're both huge fans. Trying to convince him for a cheap wedding and NZ honeymoon.
What is the one type of girl you will never, ever date?	Went through the whole thread and no one said "single moms." Nothing says "I'm the shitty kind of risk taker and horrible at making decisions" like a fucking kid. Maybe someone else will like you for your personality and not mind raising a kid that isn't theirs, but not this guy.	I once dated a girl who was an otherkin. She wouldn't kiss me because that isn't what owls do, and she would always try to turn her head all the way around because she said she was too used to looking that way in her past life. I'm never going to date an otherkin ever again. It's too weird and IMHO, completely made up to get attention.

Probably frequently asked, but how do you guys "psych yourself up" to talk to a cute girl?	I ask myself, if today's my last day on Earth would I regret not being able to muster the courage to go and talk to her. If I wouldn't regret it, she probably wasn't that attractive to me anyway. Otherwise I'm definitely going to go and ask her out.	I really believe that if she rejects me I'm no worse off than I was before I talked to her. That makes it easy.
There was a thread where one of the most unattractive things to men was women that were overweight, even by 10 pounds. Can you show me what being 10 pounds overweight looks like to you?	As has been mentioned, it depends on the woman, how tall she is, how big her boobs are, yadda yadda yadda. Personally though, I'd say 10 pounds normally isn't that noticeable, but I'd say any time you see a girl in a t-shirt or a dress and you can see her stomach bloating it out, that's the "fat" line.	It depends where the 10 pounds are. A 5'3" thin girl with huge boobs and a big ass could be several pounds heavier than a 5'3" girl with small boobs and a flat ass.
What baby names do you despise?	Young moms you see on Maury that give their babies names they made up that people probably will have trouble pronouncing. It seems unfair for the kid. My name is normal and I had enough trouble getting teachers to say it right. My roommate's white sister did this with her biracial children. Her youngest is Xiamarah (if I'm spelling it right).	I dislike anything that seems like a fun name for the parent but will be awful or impractical for the kid when they're an adult. Like, Apple is a cute nickname and a cute name for a baby. But, that kid is eventually going to grow up and have to introduce herself as Apple. "Hi, I'm Apple Paltrow" just sounds ridiculous to me. I think too many parents want their kids' names to reflect how cool/quirky/unique *the parent* is and don't think about the fact that a name is usually a lifetime commitment and the kid is a separate person. "My daughter Apple" sounds like a thing a really interesting parent would say. "I'm Apple" doesn't sound like a thing a really interesting person would say.
My gym has a female janitor in the men's locker room all the time now. How do you feel about something like this? And about the double standard?	Personally, this would bother me. To have somebody who identifies as the opposite sex in the *locker room* (not solely the bathroom, there is a key distinction here) makes me remarkably uncomfortable. I actually encountered essentially the same situation, (I am a woman, though), we had a male custodian in our gym’s locker room. I talked to a manager about it, and they moved him to the men’s locker room only. If it were only a bathroom, where you go in a stall or the urinals have dividers, I think I could push it out of my mind. But the atmosphere of a locker room is disrupted with the presence of a different sex.	Former single dad. I used to use the baby changing table in the ladies room all the time because the men’s rooms rarely had them. No one ever cared. Sometimes ladies would hold the door for me, and once on a really bad day, a nice other mom even offered to change him for me because I looked so distressed. Being a single dad with an infant was damn tough.
Ladies, how do you deal with/react to catcalls, wolfwhistles etc?	It actually pumps me up a little. Granted, I don't get it that often, so when it does happen I enjoy it. I usually don't react to them though, because that would just encourage them to become more aggressive with it. I would just advise to ignore it and maybe, in some cases, take it as flattery. I was driving down the road one day and my boobs were having a very nice day, looking very hot in my camisole. This guy in a dump truck passes me, then slows down to pass me again. I looked over and he honked his horn and waved at me. I was so giddy for the rest of the day! So, like I said, in some cases it can be good for your self-esteem!	I usually just ignore it and don't even give them the time of day. According to my husband, the best thing to do is to make the most disgusted face you possibly can, like you're about to throw up. "Nothing wounds the male ego like disgust." He said to do it if you're at a stoplight and someone in the next car over is being a prick. Haven't tried it...
Who's the dumbest person you've ever met and why?	To be completely honest probably my mother. I have met thousands of people in my life but no one really stacks up to her. I don't enjoy trash talking her cause she is a good person morally but intellectually she really is just kinda lost. She doesn't know what an atom is, where most countries on Earth are, the planets, what air is composed of, what the big bang theory is, and pretty much every fundamental fact about the universe we live in.	A girl I went on a date with. I don't remember how the conversation got there, but she legit thought WW2 and nazis was just a movie thing. I thought she was kidding at first, but she was dead serious.
Have you ever lost your SO's trust?	I cheated on my girlfriend with my best friend. We talked, fought, and broke up. We both admitted to playing a roll in the break up and realized we loved each other to much to end it after a month. Plot twist: it's been 2 years and not only are we doing amazing but they're actually best friends now.	Telling your SO you quit smoking isn't the best idea if you're a 2 pack a day smoker. Long term I'd say that her finding out about it was the biggest factor in our breakup.
Women mid-20s and above, what do you wish you knew entering your 20s?	Don't rush into anything: relationships, college, career, etc... play the field in all areas rather than rushing in to a commitment. Make sure any commitment you make is for YOU and not your parents, friends, society, or anyone else. Enjoy all the young people stuff while you can! A 30+ year old at a spring break bikini beach beer pong party just isn't cute. Do all those young and crazy kid things while you can (backpack through Spain, volunteer in Belize, move to the beach... you know, irresponsible stuff). Don't have regrets! And, of course, don't forget all the wise stuff: use sun screen and condoms, don't try hard drugs like meth or heroin, and start a savings account.	I wish I'd understood the colossal amounts of change I'd experience. I'm almost 28 and I'm not *remotely* the same person I was at 20. I don't want any of the same things, a lot of my worldview has shifted, my social circle has changed drastically. I'm more confident, I have way more money, I feel like I have a direction and control over my life, and the future doesn't freak me out nearly as much. Your twenties aren't when you get "old." Your twenties are when you do a lot of growing up (which is not the same as becoming all serious and not having fun -- I have tons of fun and plan to continue). And it's been a little scary but mostly exciting so far. Also, yes, sunscreen. And try not to dig yourself into any financial holes.
How do you handle a crush on a co-worker?	I live with her and she's driving me up the wall. I'm in the same boat you are buddy except I'm her boss and she's only 18. Honestly I'd just find another job or get a girlfriend if I was you.	Sounds like you know she isn’t available. So get over it? Edit: sorry, that’s a tad cold. I’ve had a crush on someone unavailable before. It’s unhealthy. The only thing you can do is be honest with yourself about the situation and move past it. Don’t view her as an option unless she approaches you in the future. And don’t set yourself up to be approached in hopes she will. You move on.
What's the most silly/clueless thing you've ever seen a guy say about women here on reddit?	Actually I've wondered that myself. I realize it's not an erotic time, but when the inserter is penetrating, nothing? My wife has an orgasm (nearly) the instant I insert a finger.	Some guy once got into a serious argument with me, because he believed that women left hair ties at men's places, to stake their territory, or so that they could force a second date. And continued to hold this opinion, even after I tried to explain that they cost like .10 a piece, and forgetting them places is such a common occurrence that most women with long hair will carry at least 2 or 3 of them in their purses at all times.
fellow men, do you ever not feel unwanted, and how do you get over it?	Be a man and shrug the feels off. It happens to me sometimes but I just ignore such feelings. Sometimes you just need to dump your old useless friends. Take up a hobby or something and you can meet great people. That is what I did and it worked for me. If your family is plain shite, limit your interaction with them. I did that and I never felt better. Can't help you in the girlfriend/wife department as I have no such luck with women.	Honestly, most men use work for this. It's a major contributing factor to why men make more money. We don't usually feel like we're desired or wanted in relationships, we often always feel the ones providing. So work is where a lot of men work hard to get the feeling of being wanted at work.
What do you prefer and why - condo or house living?	HOA's are the worst. Buy a house. Plus new construction is shit in comparison to a good solid house that was built in the mid 20th century.	House. Condo is just a glorified apartment, and you often have association fees. I like being responsible for my living area, not everyone else's.
Skinny men - Does it bother you when people feel the need to point it out constantly? What do you do about it?	I had a random Haitian woman on the street ask if I was hungry. I stared awkwardly as I was just thrown off. I awkwardly grinned and said, "Oh no, I just had eaten". Then walked off feeling like I should really eat more.	It used to be annoying for me, I've just learned to shrug it off and not really respond, it is what it is. I know I'm healthy and am happy with myself so why bother?
Why are/were you not ready for a relationship?	They're just a pain in the ass. You sacrifice your freedom and happiness for the obligation of caring about some jerk and the pressure of their/their families expectations. Who has time for that shit? Particularly since there's plenty of other women my age who are totally down to just bang it out every once in a while with zero pressure for it to be anything beyond that. I'll think about doing a relationship again once I'm in my 30s, and I start meeting women who have been beaten down by the realities of the world enough that their expectations of how much effort I'm willing to put in aren't completely unrealistic.	I really value my alone time but i’m also clingy. I basically want the other person to fit into my life according to my very specific schedule. I know that’s dumb and unreasonable, so until i figure that out i’d rather be single.
Those who live a healthier lifestyle, what do you bring for lunch to work everyday?	Carrying a lunch bag does not go well with my outfit 🦊 I eat out at lunch. A wrap mostly.	I can’t eat breakfast right when I get up, so I bring a few handfuls of almonds and a banana to have around 9 am at work... makes a big difference and I’m not starving at lunch. For lunch I usually have rice with roasted veggies or veggie curry. I make a big batch and freeze portions. Snack can be another piece of fruit or trail mix. I have a herbal tea every morning with my breakfast at work and coffee maybe twice a week. Key is planning. It’s when you’re caught short and starving you make bad decisions.
My girlfriend is great and we're great togther, but why do I sometimes feel like I have a gut feeling we're not right for each other?	I usually follow my gut feeling. it has this amazing power of keeping me from bad things. Sometimes you can't do that without concrete reason, so you keep your gut feeling in mind until something bad happen and it rings a bell. why do you feel she's not right for you? when did you that feeling? if the only reason is because she's different than the girl you've always though you'd be with..let me tell you something no one ends up with the people they thought they would end up with.	Sometimes I feel the same way about my SO. Sometimes not. That's life. But after 40 years or so, I still can't think any woman who was a better fit for me. And I dated a ton of women. Have you ever met this imaginary woman who would be a better fit for you?
What was the stupidest thing you heard anyone say, or saw them do, about money?	Anyone who says something like "now is a good time to invest in the stock market." You can't time the market. Also, people who call things like diamond engagement rings, or expensive watches investments. No they are not.	My perpetually in-debt friend who complains about how poor she is: "I just bought a super cute new pair of shoes!" "I thought you were going to stop using your credit card" "No no I bought these with real money, not my credit card." "YOUR CREDIT CARD IS STILL REAL MONEY."
Boss women of reddit, what has been your strangest reaction to your position of power?	Honestly I wish stories like these flooded twitter rather than angry feminists who don’t actually help the problem and discredit real issues by drawing attention to their own victimization.	I've had a male subordinate who was doing poorly tell me he needed a new boss because I was "too like his mom for him to respect." He did not receive a new manager. Nor did he keep his job.
How would you feel if your girlfriend showed a picture of your dick to her friends without your permission?	My girlfriend did this the other day and I had no problem with it at all. Actually it was quite the ego boost cause her friends jaw dropped when she saw what I was packing. Idk It made me smile.	I would be angry because If I wanted someone else to see it I would've taken it out or shown them a pic.
Is it OK if your SO's ex is now his/her best friend? Where is the fine line in all of this?	The line is trust. Do you trust your SO? If not, why do you stay with them? Why do they stay with you?	That would be a yellow flag or an orange flag for me. Not a straight up no from me but i would only be ok if i was already part of their friend circle and could see the dynamic to make sure there were not boundary issues or some other dysfunction. I know plenty of exes who are good friends but i also know plenty with boundary issues, some who are still fwb and stuff, being emotional backups for each other...i wouldn't want to be in the middle of such a deep connection, i am just not into that kind of drama at my age.
What cultural stereotypes have you never seen or experienced, thus makes you wonder why that stereotype exists?	As a brown guy, am I seriously supposed to think that Japanese, Chinese and Korean people are the “racist” ones? Lmao	The stereotype that says immigrants are lazy and just want to live off welfare. (And yet somehow steal all the jobs?) I know two women who came here from Venezuela and they're both university educated and own their own businesses. My mom was an immigrant herself and she was always employed and made money as an artist on the side. The foreign business owners where I work (mall) are polite and run their stores well. The only person I know who faked a disability for benefits and stayed at home to chain smoke and chug Mt. Dew all day? My stepmother whose family had been here for generations.
What are your thoughts on the Harvey Weinstein controversy?	He's a piece of shit, but for every girl he sexually assaulted there's 10 who willingly sucked his dick in exchange for a movie part and knew exactly what they were doing and did it willingly. Some of those same women will come out and say it was non-consensual too. This shouldn't really be news for anyone, Hollywood is an incredibly promiscuous and vice filled industry that is overflowing with hypocrisy around every issue they pretend to champion. I'd be willing to bet that Weinstein isn't even the worst offender and more will be coming out. Also I'd be willing to bet that some sick kiddo pedophile shit will come out of this somehow, Weinstein or not.	I'm sad but not shocked. The casting couch thing in Hollywood isn't a new thing. Hopefully people who have been effected can find closure now.
What's a common sentiment on r/AskMen that makes you feel bad or insecure?	Not super common, maybe, but there seems to be a bias that circumcised men are somehow less than uncircumcised. I just don't get it.	I've seen a lot on here that could easily cause insecurities or negativity, but I've learned that you REALLY can't let what you read online affect you that way. You never know who's behind the screen, in the end they are anonymous strangers...let your actual experiences guide you, not the opinions of an anonymous niche website.
How was your experience with Tinder/Tinder pro?	I see no reason for Pro, even though I am a professional Tinderer. So far it's been great. I've probably met up with over 200+ women from Tinder in the last 3 years. It's great for me because I travel for work, so it makes meeting women in strange cities exceptionally easy. I still do plenty of Tindering, but I've shifted most of my attention to Bumble which is Tinder, but with less trash on it.	Do the free version. Pro just adds more swipes and like an undo option. The free one still gives plenty for you to work with.
How much do you care about orgasming during sex?	ITT- a bunch of women who sadly have not orgasmed. Seriously ladies set aside an afternoon, with our without your ~~man~~ partner and get to it. Hell, set aside several afternoons. Orgasms are life changing. As for those myths that women can't. They're myths created by men so that they can get theirs without doing the work to get their partner's off. Ridiculous BS.	idk like a 7 maybe? Only because it's very easy to make me orgasm. I'd rather have a nice long session where both of us feel nice and intimate with eachother and don't orgasm rather than a quick pump that lasts two minutes that I do orgasm from. That being said I always orgasm from any sex tbh so it's not an issue.
What do you think of CEO Sheryl Sandberg's advice that girls should date a bunch of bad boys before settling down with a dependable guy?	I disagree with Sandberg's advice myself, but this is the advice that men get about women. Men get told that they should fuck all kinds of hot crazy girls when they're young and then find a nice sweet innocent girl to marry.	This is part of the reason why partner count matters to me in dating. I want someone who is looking for a good match from the start, not someone who thinks it's fun to date around with a bunch of douchebags and assholes, before settling down with a "safe" guy. I'm not a dating retirement home. I won't be the guy she falls back on. I am an equal, and as an equal, I'll decide whether or not I date a girl, and if I think she's dating me because I'm dependable and she's had her fun, I'm going to have a serious problem.
WESTERN men: Does it bother you if your gf drinks and/or gets drunk?	No Everyone is expected to drink, there is nothing shameful about it in Western society (unless you are an alcoholic).	The only two reasons I would ever want my SO to ***not*** drink with me is if they: A) Were an alcoholic B) Were planning on driving/some other reason for sobriety Without me, it's whatever floats your boat (still keeping A and B in mind)
Ladies, last night my SO told me, "You aren't the best looking girl I've dated but you *are* the best girlfriend I've ever had." What things has your SO told you that made you question your relationship?	As a man, I cannot understand why that would upset you so much. I know that he could have just said "you are the best girlfriend I ever had", but is your happiness really that tied up in him pretending that you are the most beautiful woman who ever agreed to go out with him? His previous girlfriends' looks are unimportant at this point. The important thing is that he values you over all of them for other qualities. Those qualities might even be more important and less superficial than your appearance. You should take that as a very nice compliment even if it was a bit awkwardly worded.	i don't know...i don't think this would bother me too much. my husband isn't the best looking man i've dated either...BUT he is head and shoulders above all the other men i've ever dated with regards to integrity, intelligence, humour, character...pretty much everything. the guy is a dream. who cares if he's not the most attractive? he's the "most" at all the other measures that really count.
Men, are you really that oblivious when it comes to whether or not a girl is into you?	No. Honestly every time I read one of these threads on a similar topic around 'I have no idea when a girl is into me' I'm always left perplexed, and frankly a little dubious. Maybe it's a tactic other men use to act aloof or something, but to me (trying to not come over arrogant here) it's pretty obvious when a girl is into me. I'm not talking about clichéd physical 'tells' like playing with her hair or holding your gaze etc etc, but you just have a feeling when things are going well with a girl. She's responding attentively to you and to what you're saying, you're doing the same. It's on. Maybe it's an age thing. I'm 32 now and settled with a gf, but this really hasn't been an issue for over 10 years now.	It's two things: * Some guys really are that oblivious * Other guys see the possible hints, but one girl's "obvious hints" is another girl's "just being friendly". That, plus not wanting to be "creepy" = overly cautious At this point, I'd still be a bit skeptical if a girl said she liked me. It goes against years of negative reinforcement, and it would take more than a single, one-off contrarian opinion for me to change my mindset.
Do you ever picture the calendar year in your head? What does your mental calendar look like?	In my head my calendar is a circle too. It has no up or down, because in this circle I always stand on the date and look across it - where the other months are... It's really hard to explain ._. Each month has a special colour, january is light blue, february is red, march is orange, ...;	My mental calendar is totally based on my school calendar, with September at the start and summer far, far away at the end.
When you see a woman wearing ANY kind of ring on her left ring-finger, do you assume she's engaged/married?	No, left ring finger is reserved for marriage ring. You aren't "allowed" to wear a ring on this finger unless you're married.	Usually that specific finger is reserved for being engaged/married and the like. And nowadays there are more and more people opting for other sorts of rings besides strictly getting a diamond one for getting engaged/married. So what I'm trying to say is yes, I do.
What is a sexist custom / double standard that has actually changed since your childhood?	Well, I'm a guy and it's still frowned upon for me to crossdress even if it's not for sexual kicks. But it's ok if it's the other way around.	When Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in the early 1980s, it was seen as necessary for the bride of the heir to the throne to be a virgin. When Prince William married Kate Middleton a few years ago, that wasn't even a thing - to the extent that people weren't even talking about how that isn't a thing any more.

What is the cheesiest thing that your SO has ever done to you but you still love it anyway?	With my husband: Our first valentine's day, he made a playlist of some of the cheesiest R&B love songs. I had bought a massage candle and it came in the mail the same day. So, cheesy R&B love songs, dripping hot wax on each other and giving massages to each other, etc. Mid-deed, we also got the call that we were approved for our first apartment together. With my bf: He REALLY loves superman, and of course, has a really nice superman cape. He also likes to compare me to Wonderwoman, and when I was asleep on his bed, he covered me up with the cape, took a picture, and was just over the moon excited about it. Dorks. Both of them are dorks.	Sometimes when I'm grumpy he'll look at me all serious and go "what kind of pants are those?" Then he marches over and checks the tag and goes, "Just what I thought, meanie pants" It makes me laugh and breaks the bad mood. Gah I love that man. Edit: then he tells me I need to take them off :D Edit 2: Thanks for the gold whoever gilded me! First gold!
Global check in: how is everyone with anxiety/depression/chronic pain doing today?	My new disabled parking placard came and I'm downright gleeful. I know people complain about handicap parking, but as someone who frequently can't walk well or without severe pain, I would gladly bash your ankles with a metal bat and then have you walk from the back of the lot to the store to see if you get it then. If not, I already have the bat. Head it is.	Not good, I'm on my period and it's making me feel extra bad this time, like I'm just angry/irritable and crying for no reason. I would think it's PMDD if it was a regular thing, but it's just confusing to me because I feel off.
Do women know when they're being handled by a wingman?	I would think anyone who uses a "wingman" is a coward, and I wouldn't be interested in anyone who doesn't have the balls to come up to me and speak to me directly.	Yes, and we don't necessarily mind as long as the guy is friendly and doesn't try to pretend like we can't figure it out. Your best bet is to both engage both of us actively in conversation so it feels less contrived. If you and your friend are both nice to me, I'll probably wingman for you a little when we inevitably do a bathroom retreat to discuss it. If your wingman is the only one talking to me and you are trying to separate us too soon, I am going to shut it down. She came with me, and we probably have a plan to split a cab or an agreement not to leave each other alone, and I will enforce it if I don't like the way it's being handled.
Women of Reddit, I (27M) want to snazz up my apartment a bit. What do you often find men are lacking in their abodes?	If you do a search I'm sure you'll get some results, this get asked pretty frequently. It always makes me kind of confused when guys ask because I didn't realize furnishing an apartment was that complicated. What do you want in your apartment? (Not what are the bare necessities, what do you want?) Get that stuff.	I find that guys tend to leave the walls bare, so you might want to put up some prints/posters to make it look cozier. What does it look like now? It's hard to give advice when I don't know what you're starting off with.
What makes a guy boring to you?	Being too eager about spending time with me. Like when we're having dinner one night and he texts the next morning about meeting up in the evening. and on the next day. and on the next day...	Just generally not being compatible in terms of interests, communication style, sense of humor, etc. Doesn't mean he's a bad person or anything, but I'd say the overwhelming majority of people just don't interest me that much.
What accent have you got?	not much of one to be honest. I was born in Massachusetts but moved to Ohio when I was 2. I moved BACK when I was about 12. The result is a lazy slipping in and out occasionally of the new england accent but largely nothing. when people ask where I'm from and I say Cape Cod they double take because I just don't sound like it. When I'm home visiting though, I slip into it like old sneakers almost immediately. :)	American, but Chinese American, it's very subtle. It's hard to describe but I notice it in other Chinese Americans in my area who are fluent in English but grew up speaking a Chinese language. (I can also "sound white" when I want/need to.)
What is something annoying/frustrating that women do without realizing it?	Pretending to be 'uncertain' about a situation and therefore seeking advice, while it is patently obvious that their only goal is to tell everyone what total asshole or bitch this third person is, and that everyone had better start agreeing with her. The most infuriating part is that it doesn't even matter if everyone knows this third person, like a colleague or something. They'll gladly reveal any personal bits of information shared in confidence if it gets others to agree with them. Gossiping is basically convincing others that a common acquaintance is a bad person. And they wonder why men look down on women...	Often my girlfriend will ask me to retrieve something or get her something while we're both sitting or she is closer to the thing she wants than I am. I mean, i love her and i'm happy to help her out, but it gets kind of ridiculous when i'm in the middle of something and she's not doing anything at all, yet she's still asking me to go get her a glass of water.
Other than technique, what makes a blowjob special?	A pretty face with puppy dog eyes. Moaning, groaning, humming. If she makes the same sexy moans she makes when eating her favourite food then it's gonna be a quick blowjob.	Not having to ask for one. A random and spontanious blowjob. EDIT: Lol guys, I've never had a BJ in my life.....hahahaha... :(
The US Treasury today announced that they are replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 with Harriet Tubman. What are your thoughts on this, if any?	Trade a NDN killer for WoC?? YES. YES. AND YES. I've lived so far to see a black president and now Harriet Tubman on a $20, you bet I'll be saving one of those for sure! Next up a NA persons or Brown person. WATTBA.	I'd like to see a Native American woman replace Andrew "Hmmm that Trail could use a lot more Tears on it" Jackson, but I'll take Harriet Tubman. It's good to have someone on our most common distributed denomination of currency that actually fought back against oppression instead of institutionalized it.
Have you ever quit a job due to sexism, and if so what was going on to make you quit?	My boss was a friend of the family who smelled bad and hugged too long. He leered at the younger (female) employees a lot, and his wife was the manager so nothing was done about it. After I left, my friend's little sister started working there and he's been, like, groping her and shit. The company handles this shit extremely poorly on an administrative level, too, so there's not much hope for change.	Yes. I was required to act as the office secretary on top of being a programmer. So, I and another woman had the same job title as two men, we were all hired at the same time. The older woman programmer (the only other woman in the company) would make us answer the phones, take all the notes at any meetings, set up things like sending cards for sick coworkers, etc. The four of us all hired at the same time would hang out together over lunch, etc, and found out that the male new hires weren't required to do that stuff and actually weren't even aware that we were being told TO do it. I figured I could find better work elsewhere, so I did. Shortly thereafter, so did the other woman new hire, and one of the men.
My cats are plainly tired of me asking them if they are silly cats. What kind of conversations do you hold with your pets?	I have a rescue kitten with clear abandonment issues so I try to talk to her as normal as possible. Mostly I just ask her where her toys are, because she keeps hiding them. I'm also raising her bilingual in german and english.	My guinea pig picks what movie we watch. I hold up a bunch of movies and whichever one he smells first is the one we watch. Based on his track record, he's a big fan of Guardians of the Galaxy.
Happily married women of reddit, what is the most difficult time you and your spouse have worked through?	I've been married for 6 years. The first year was the hardest. We were 20. And we both had a lot of issues dealing with immaturity and I found my husband had a porn addiction. We worked through it though and he got help with his porn issue and we both just started to grow up and work on our marriage. Things are soooo much better now. And God is a big reason for that as well. I'm very happy with my life and don't regret getting married young at all. It was hard at first, but in the long run worth it.	Been together for 14 married for 11. Our biggest disagreement was how many kids to have when we had been married for five years. We had two already and I really wanted another two and he was happy with what we already had. We spent months going back and forward over the pros and cons. After many discussions he decided that one more would be a good idea and I to let go of the notion of having four kids. A compromise if you will. At the first ultra sound of my third pregnancy we found out we were having twins.
Guys with girl best friends (who aren't SOs) - what's the modesty situation like between you guys?	Same with a male best friend, if it was actually 100% platonic I wouldn't show my butt / junk to her, and wouldn't be looking for hers. But then again, I would never have a female best friend.	Never seen her private bits or her boobs or butt. I'm not going to show her mine either. That's not something I share with just friends, even if we're besties.
NSFW: Favorite adult video stars?	Porn stars are pretty unsexy to me by default. Just the fact that it's so fake seeming does nothing for me!	Jynx Maze because of her ass, skin color and face, Lexi Belle because she is cute and can orgasm easily and Roxy Raye because she is really creative and does a lot of anal. Some other favorites would be Cytheria, Heather Harmon (aka Heather Brooke), Remy Lacroix, Bonnie Rotten, Asa Akira, Christy Mack, Sophie Dee and Naomi Russell.
How do you feel about picking out your own engagement ring together?	I was vehemently against choosing my own ring when I got engaged. If he didn't know me well enough to pick out a ring I like, we shouldn't be getting married. The ring he chose is gorgeous, not something I would have chosen for myself but I'm reminded of him and his reasons for choosing it every time I look down 😍	I think it's a great idea to pick a ring together, that way you'll be sure that it's a ring you both like. I've heard of enough stories where someone got an awful ring 😅 Also the proposal can still be a surprise, you'll either pick out the ring later together or you'll be surprised with the ring you both picked out.
What are the top 5 qualities you search in a girl and top 3 that you avoid as much as possible?	*Top 5 requirements: Attractive Good to talk to A good person Independent Has a good career *Top 3 no-nos Fat Is crazy. Kids.	Looking for: 1. Similar sense of humor 2. Somewhat medium maintenance 3. Has her own life 4. Hand Eye Coordination 5. Likes the outdoors Avoid: 1. High Maintenance 2. Emotional Baggage/Bumpy relationship track record 3. Narcissism

Have you found girls can be pretty laid back about condoms?	My boyfriend was more eager to drop condoms than I was. I've consistently been on the pill for years now and getting pregnant still worries me. I want to possibly get an IUD but I'm worried about potential side effects.	I'm always worried in the back of my head about the chicks who say "oh go ahead, no need to use a condom". Unless I know and trust you I'd prefer condom. For me it's about 50%.
What’s a popular book, old or new, that you found disappointing due to its poor portrayal of female characters?	I didn’t really like The Awakening or the Yellow Wallpaper. Both are important early feminist works that capture how trapped women were by the bounds of society but I prefer my main heroines to be fearless tomboys (like Jo March from Little Women) or badass ambitious types like Becky Sharpe (Vanity Fair) or Scarlet O’Hara (Gone with the Wind). Or even gritty survivors like Rukmani in Nectar in a Seive or O-lan in The Good Earth. I guess I like positive, optimistic and determined characters rather than retiring and depressive Emily Dickenson/Sylvia Plath types. The women I’ve known in life have been more in line with the former	Haruki Murakami is a very creative guy, but his treatment of women in his novels is definitely not great. Very few of them seem to have any real agency of their own or act in a way that resembles an actual woman. They're more of lust objects than people. And he's definitely guilty of those oft-parodied, unnecessarily booby descriptions.
Have you ever wanted to take a break from life? Like take a break from it all and do nothing? Like go live with a friend that no one knows about and just be a bum for a year or 2?	My dream is to have a hippie summer, packing myself, my fiance, and some friends into a bus and riding across the country, doing drugs and doing gigs/bartering for money, food, and goods.	I will do that this year. Have been planning it for a while. In a few months I will move to a village on a tropical island and do nothing for eight to ten months.
When did you realize people started to see you as an object of desire and no longer a little girl?	Reading through this is very depressing. I wonder where you all are from though? I’m Norwegian and kinda came here to say ‘never’, but thinking about it I guess I was hit on by a French guy in Paris when I was 16-17. Catcalling doesn’t really exist here, and apart from when I’ve been abroad or maybe a few times in bars with older men being gross, I’ve never really felt like ‘an object of desire’. Like, maybe I’m not pretty enough or I’m just oblivious to it, but I think this is a lot more widespread in certain cultures, like American and Mediterranean cultures.	12 and I, like pretty much everyone answering here, was a little girl who was super confused and uncomfortable when it happened. I wish I could go back in time and protect her and all of us.
How do your personal experiences clash with the common consensus you see on the Internet?	I honestly don't believe there's such a thing as a radical feminist, and cherrypicked tumblr posts aren't evidence. Feminism is about equal rights, and the majority of people that go on reddit are feminists, even if they don't classify themselves as ones.	Internet dating is difficult. I know so many couples that have met via it. (we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, and met 4 other couples who meet via okcupid)
When have you realized some of your friends are actually kind of shitty friends?	Quite regularly. When my mood is low I regularly feel abandoned. I have to think for a good few months when I think this about a friend to ensure I'm right.	When we'd hang out and they'd spend the whole time talking about themselves & not a take a minute to even say, "So what's up with you?" Seriously if you only text me to talk about yourself, best believe you're getting a one worded response.
what was the last compliment you received from a women that you don’t plan on removing from your mind anytime soon?	Why would I remove a compliment from my mind? Is that another way of saying "you won't forget"? I got complimented on my outfit by a couple coworkers today.	"You're a good dad." People (men and women) have said this to me before, but this woman specifically is a closer friend than they are and she had a really rough relationship with both of her parents. Just the way she said it made me feel less like she "was just saying it" and more that she was being honest. Times when I'm at my wit's end with my kid I remember that and it helps calm me down
What is the most fucked up thing a guy has ever said to you?	"You're the second best sex I've ever had and it's because I was in love with that other girl." My boyfriend said this when we're FWB, he met is as compliment but I loved him even then and it fucked me up to pretty terribly. Even now he can't seem to keep his foot out of his mouth.	I work as Princess Belle at children's parties, the dad of the birthday girl leaned in and said "Well, Belle, my cock is quite the beast." **At his own damn daughter's birthday party… what is wrong with you?!**
Where did you get your holy grail leggings? Why are they the greatest?	Ahhhh so many recommendations, most of them do not fit plus-size! So sad! My favorite leggings are from New Zealand, "Wild Child" brand. However, I've been getting by in the US with Torrid and Wal-Mart. Ugh, poor quality and quickly fade. However, they are the only ones that actually fit my super thunder-thighs. I would give my pinkie toe for some fleece-lined plus-size leggings that actually fit me. I ordered some from Avenue in their largest size. They're long enough (and so soft!) but don't stretch enough for my thighs :(	Ok bear with me here: Walgreens. I don't know why but their leggings are the BEST. They're thick and so soft and warm, pass the squat test, have a high waist, the waistband is plushy and thick, and they're just all around amazing. I have a pair, most of my friends have a pair, my mom has a pair. They're great. Trust me.
What's your favorite thing your pet does?	One of my cats and my beagle love to play. The cat will go catch a mouse or chipmunk and bring it over within range of the dogs on her lead then let it go for the dog to catch. If if runs out of her range the cat with catch it and bring it back to the starting point. They do this until the poor creature either dies or gets away. Basically they team up to torture and kill small animals. It's really adorable once you get past that though.	Every morning my 70lb pitbull (Raven) lays with her neck on my neck like she's trying to hold me down so I can't leave her for work lol. It's so uncomfortable but it's like the sweetest snuggles. And the excited butt wiggles from my 3month baby pit (Lana) when I come home, so much joy! https://i.imgur.com/worzicP.jpg here they are :)
When was the last time you felt appreciated?	Woman here - when my ex said that he’d fulfil a promise that I didn’t think that he’d even remembered or cared about despite all of the other things he’d forgotten or falsely assumed. It really touched my heart but I didn’t tell him because I didn’t want to open that box again. Before that/him? Ehhhhh. Idk. It’s been some months/years since I’ve *really* felt appreciated.	My friend, whose dad just died, came up to me today between classes to say hi again. We had talked sporadically right before and after his dad died, but he's obviously been super overwhelmed. I'm surprised he was even at school. But we talked for a bit and he thanked me for sending him random memes and asked if I was free for the weekend. And that felt nice.
Does it annoy you when family or friends take candid pictures of you?	It is annoying, but whatever. Unless they end up on social media without my permission. My mother is notorious for this. She'll post horrible pictures of me, and when I had a Facebook, tag me in them constantly. She still can't seem to understand why I don't want unflattering photos of me up for all to see...	Taking the pictures, doesn't bother me. Whatever. Posting horrible pictures of me online without asking my thoughts bothers me a lot. My mom keeps posting horribly ugly pictures of me to her flickr, and they come up when someone googles my name. So like a prospective employer sees her stupid candid shot of me finding a key lime pie gross at Christmas. UGH.
Does women commenting on "dad bods" offend you?	I think the double standard about women being able to care about weight, but men being shamed if they do is horrible. But on the other hand, people who say "dadbod" are idiots, and I don't hang out with idiots.	We can go on a tangent about double social standards, hypocrite “feminists” ect… But to save ourselves some time I’ll just say this: It’s a good habit to not get offended by stupid people.
What's the most accurate portrayal of mental illness you've seen in media?	I took a girl to go see Silver Lining's Playbook in theaters. When it ended and she was crying I realized my life wasn't normal :/ So ya, SLP is accurate enough that I didn't really distinguish it too much from reality. I've been meaning to read the book.	First episode of Mr. Robot when he's crying and he says that his crying episodes have been happening weekly then says "What do normal people do when they get this sad? Turn to family and friends?" Also in that episode when he's standing outside of a bar wanting to go in because it's his friend's birthday but he can't bring himself to go inside because he's overcome with anxiety and can't get himself to socialize. Really struck a chord with me. The whole series is a very fresh and realistic depiction of anxiety and depression.
If you're wearing a skirt and have to use the bathroom, do you pull your skirt up from the bottom and your underwear down, or do you pull both the skirt and underwear down?	Always pull down. But mind you a lot of my skirts don't have the type of flowy-ness that would be pulled up easily.	Up! And if it's an especially light, wispy skirt/dress, I'll tuck it into my bra band through my top to hold it up.
Everyone's heard of fuckboys by now. What is the biggest "fuckgirl" thing you've ever seen?	Awkwardly adds any contemporary faddish word or expression to her vocabulary (crush, shipping etc). Takes any of the Kardashian seriously. Addicted to social media and shitty reality shows.	Show up at the bar/club without money, but expecting to get drunk asking random men she isn't interested in to buy her a drink
What's something a former SO did that you didn't realize was unacceptable until after your break-up? What made you see the light?	He was a smoker. I tried to get him to quit but he wouldn't listen. It used to get all over my outfit and hair and everything :( So, so gross. Smoking has been such a big no, no for me since then.	- Called me a dumb bitch when I tried to calm him down when he was pissed off at a video game - "Borrowed" $800 from my mother because he was too busy buying new toys for his computer to pay attention to his bank account and wound up owing the bank said money in overcharge fees - Didn't seem to want to live more than twenty miles away from his parents - Took his laundry home for his mother to do Yeah, no. Really glad that one didn't work out.
What is a common misconception about your career?	That it was some sort of linear progression rather than a series of chances I took and good (and bad) things that happened over time.	"You must be good at math!" I'm an accountant, Excel does all of my math for me and even then 90℅ of that math is just addition and subtraction. What I AM good at is understanding tedious procedures and filling out forms. And as I wind down my bartending career, I'd like to make it known that the majority of other bartenders I've worked with over the last decade were all in long term relationships if not married with kids. Flirting with us is fun but not going to achieve anything.
Why Send Nudes?	I would never in a million years do that. I don't see the appeal, and I also think it's extremely risky. In my opinion, society has really done a disservice to people by promoting this activity as no big deal because it can have very serious consequences.	As a lesbian, it's not just dudes who enjoy getting nudes. I've sent them and have received them but it's something I do with trusted partners (not hookups/casuals) as a type of foreplay. Yes, obviously they get to see "the real thing" whenever they want but sending a few teasing pictures back and forth when we aren't physically together is fun and flirty! I've never felt even a little bit fearful about my pictures being spread around though. I guess I just feel like my exes are mature enough that the idea would never cross their mind quite frankly.
How have women tried to pressure you into making a relationship more serious?	Suggesting cohabiting, talking about future kids (I let people know before we date that there won't be kids nor cohabiting). Pushing for me to want more than there is or acting like I'm a git for not wanting more when they do... I've an "ex" (we end out for a couple of months but weren't official) that was long distance. She asks me once, totally casually: "How often do you want to see each other?" Me: Every 3-4 weeks would be fine. HER: THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!!! She gets pissy and we have this weird conversation, and she eventually writes me this letter that includes, "What have we even been doing for the last month?!?" For me, the pressure tends to show up in them getting upset that I'm not where they are emotionally. EDIT: Typos	By being such an amazing, compassionate partner in my life, I couldn't help but want to spend the rest of my life with her. Crafty bitch, using her evil tricks of caring about and supporting me to trick me into giving up being single.
How do I, a gay man, befriend straight guys without them thinking I am hitting on them?	The same way a straight male befriends another straight male? You rub dicks together and then you're friends; this isn't that hard.	you don't hit on them. You talk about stuff you have in common and do it and whatever. Just don't flirt while doing it? If they say "are you hitting on me" say "no, sorry if I came across like that" and that's it
Men of Reddit, what makes you respect one girl more than the other?	self respect. I'll get down voted but this also includes the way she's dressed, especially if it's inappropriate for the particular environment.	If I'm chilling with someone I watch how they interact with other people. If they're nice to random peeps my respect for them goes up, if they're rude it goes down.
Use a throwaway if you must. What "dumb" sports question have you always been too embarrassed to ask?	Okay, it's almost philosophical but... Why do you insist in American football to tackle with your head? I mean why people only realize now that it's somewhat damaging. Edit: Why the downvotes? It's a genuine question and I thought we were here to ask the embarrassing ones...	My question: when the ball goes out of bound in basketball, how does the receiving team choose who is going to pass it back in? It seems like it just gets decided with no communication.
What would the male version of Gillian Flynn's "Cool Girl"-monologue sound like? Are there "Cool Guys" and what are their identifying characteristics?	The cool guy is someone who will take you out dancing or go on trips and eat at fancy restaurants with you... when all he really wants to do is sit at home and play video games.	The "cool girl" is just someone who fits the "perfect girl" for a male archetype. So you just gotta put women into categories and find out what would be perfect for them and that guy will just do anything she wants. Is she the travelling type? The cool guy travels too and looks like some dude on instagram that does and will only want to do the stuff the girl does. Is she that sophisticated psudo intellectual? He is too and has read everything she has or will read everything she would want him to. Is she a basic like the monologuer's boyfriend. Then he probably cooks her breakfast and eats whatever diet she is on, doesn't work out but has a great body, well defined muscles and low body fat.
What are things you shouldn't say to the girl you are talking to?	Never discuss her weight. When a female coworker told me, 'I lost 15 pounds over the summer', I responded, 'Aww, don't get discouraged, they've got to be there somewhere', while looking directly at her hips. Another time, a *very* skinny girl I was dating was talking with her friend about thigh gaps, and I said something like, 'It must be nice to be able to shit while standing'. Awkward and uncomfortable silences, in both cases.	>Girl I've hung out with quite a bit and met her parents but nothing sexual done...(I'm 21) I want to masturbate to her and show her through snapchat. Risky but not sure... So what you're saying is you never want to see this girl again...

Women who have become pregnant while on birth control, what is your experience?	I got pregnant on the pill. Tri-Sprintec. Took it every day but not at the same time everyday so maybe that's where I messed up? Anyways I have the most amazing little girl I could ever ask for! Now I have the Mirena! Much better for me.	Oh my god why did I read this thread. I'm now convinced I'm pregnant and I haven't had sex in at least three months
Women that felt like a second best in a relationship, what is your story?	My estranged fiance moved back into his mom's basement because I grew tired of playing second fiddle - more like third - to his dogs. They always came first: their happiness, well-being, and everything else. They were always 'baby', 'love', 'sweetheart', etc. I just got tired of being ignored while he had to hug, kiss, and cuddle his dogs everyday. Our relationship was great until he got his first dog, then he got a second, kept a puppy from their first & only litter, and things really went downhill after that. I'm not sure if we'll get back together.	I was in a relationship for five years that, to be honest, I don't even think I ranked at 2nd. Wouldn't let me make a profile on his Xbox. Wouldn't go to the movies with me. Told me he couldn't be my best friend and boyfriend when I called him crying because my dog had been hit by a car. I'm honestly angry with myself for having low self esteem and dealing with it for 5 years.
When was the most inappropriate time you've been hit on?	In my best friends bed with her then boyfriend. All three of us immediately passed out after a rave and I woke up to him fondling my nipples. I wasn't shocked in the face of seeming harassment (this has happened to me before for fear of saying stop; fear of hurting feelings more than anything because I was much more timed then) but the disrespect aspect towards my friend. Not that she would care, anyway.	Well, once I was checking to see if a store was opened and this guy pulled up and asked me how old I was..... So I said 12. He looked me up and down and said "nice", then drove away. He was at least middle aged.
How do I hold myself accountable and make myself get off my ass and do what I need?	I’m the same way. I just sit around until one day I feel like doing it and I get it done. I do this with every single thing	Stop viewing decisions as choosing what to do, and start viewing them as choosing who to be. When the alarm goes for the gym and your hand is hovering over the snooze button, don't ask yourself if you want to sleep for another ten minutes. Ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who is lazy and doesn't follow through on commitments. I can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time, but it will be a lot more effective. And once you start living a life that is consistent with your personal values, your self esteem will rocket upwards.
Why do people always assume youre a dude on the internet?	As a guy, I think it's because when we were all growing up and the Internet was young, it WAS mostly guys on these sites. I remember being a kid and having girls think we were nerdy for liking being on the computer and doing things like YouTube or whatnot. I guess the times have changed and more girls are online but the perception is still there	I dunno. I actually often assume people I'm talking to are dudes on the internet also, much to my chagrin.
Women who are conventionally attractive: Do you have any stories where your attractiveness has actually been a disadvantage in your career (or your life) ?	This question alone demonstrates a disadvantage for attractive women. The use of the word "actually" makes it sound like you don't even believe an attractive woman can be disadvantaged, which in and of itself is a disadvantage to an attractive women. I am constantly treated this way. "There's no way she's not a bitch, there's no way she doesn't get everything she wants, there's no way blah blah blah". Just because I am conventionally attractive. I once had a coworker say: "I wanted to hate you because you're so pretty, but you're just so nice." Thanks.	No one takes me seriously. They assume that I'm stupid and even when I prove that I'm not, there's still that feeling. It's even been implied that I'd do best as a trophy wife by a manager before.
When you're being private in public, like reading a book alone at a coffee shop, does potential socialization with strangers come with the territory?	I think it's reasonable to expect that another person would be able to read into the fact that you're focused on something and not interrupt you. However, this is not always the case when I've tried to study in public. I've had headphones in while taking notes out of a textbook and had people try and start conversations.	If you're in public, socialization can be expected. However, declining to socialize can also be expected. It's a two way street.
I just found out I have 10 cavities. How has life disappointed you today?	My boyfriend told me he's going to Africa with his family for Christmas and New Years this year. I live in the U.S. and I'll have no way to reach him when the ball drops.	I transferred $4000 to a closed account by accident and now it's gone missing... How can it go to a closed account?? Why the fuck didn't it bounce?? Why was I dumb enough to do that????
What little thing has your SO done for you lately that has made you melt?	She stood back and lovingly laughed and made funny faces when I was talking to a Bernie Sanders supporter asking if I wanted him to "educate me"* on Bernie Sanders' political positions. And she hugged me after. I'm a pretty simple girl like that. *His words	My SO works on Saturdays so he gets up before me. He had been up for about an hour and I was still in bed but awake. He came into the room, and I felt him pull the covers over me so that my whole shoulder was covered. It was such a small gesture but I really appreciated him checking up on me whilst he thought I was sleeping.
Men, am I the ass?	Find a new girlfriend. Its been my experience that girls who are that emotionally needy will never be satisfied with anything less than 100% of your attention. Doesn't matter if its video games or hanging out with your buddies, its always a problem. You have to have a healthy amount of "you" time to decompress and unwind. If yours is video games and browsing the internet that's great. I'm assuming she never leaves the house to do anything with her friends, or spend anytime to herself right? Of course she does. Its an unfair double standard. She can get her "me" time in when you're at work, as she is jobless and has that kind of free time. I was in your shoes in my last relationship, I got out, and haven't been happier. Best of luck	No one's wrong here. Both of you just see things differently. You see it as you spend time with her every night watching a movie, eating, and sleeping. She sees that as she only sees you at night at home. She probably wants to go out on dates or even just spend time with you out of the house. I understand you're tired from working all week but I've heard the advice to "date your SO" and I believe that's true. Don't stop doing the things you did to get her. EDIT: But yeah she needs to do something to keep her busy. Whether it's get a job, or hobbies, or hang with her own friends. I've been in a relationship where her life was me, me, me. It didn't end well But I do know where you're coming from, trust me
What is the best compliment you have recently received?	My close friend (girl) said "damn nice muscles, you look hot" after I sent her a random selfie. Feels good man.	One of my best friends told me he looks up to me like an older brother and that what I do in life motivates him to improve himself.
What books are you currently reading?	The Stand by Stephen King. Its actually my first Stephen King book and its great! Edit: Wow after posting this I scrolled down to see im not the only one! NEAT	"The Wise Man's Fear" by Patrick Rothfuss...for about the 5th time. It is just so entertaining and readable. Also, "The Last Unicorn" by Peter S. Beagle, which is highly regarded by a number of people I regard highly.
What is a common sentiment on AskWomen that makes you roll your eyes?	That playing videos is the same as any other hobby and how dare anyone judge anyone for doing nothing but playing video games all day. Or for playing them for three hours a day. Or for anything. Like, go for a fucking walk. Pick up a book or five. Make something. It's not going to kill you to be something other than glued to your chair.	"Just get an IUD!" Yeah no, I'd love nothing more (except maybe a tubal) but in the US you can't get an IUD on my lack of income and health insurance. But Planned Parenthood will give me pills for free, so please just answer my damn pill questions and stop recommending an option that is not open to me.
Right-handed folk dating lefties; what are some unintended challenges related to your handedness?	This question does not run afoul of our majority demographics rule, as it is directed at right handed people *dating left handed people*. Most right handed people date other right handed people. Hah, reporter. Out-pedanted! However, left handed people dating right handed people should feel free to answer as well :p.	So, I'm a lefty, but my SO is right handed and the only issue we run into is sitting next to each other at dinner. Sit on the wrong side and we're bumping elbows all night.
What’s your “no good deed goes unpunished” story?	Before Trump was elected I tried and tried to do good by pointing out the many ways that he is not fit for office. My warnings were not heeded. Our punishment is that now we have a person that proves every day he is unqualified for the office of president of the United States. (edit) It's been one month since this was posted. Speak up people. Let Trump supporters know that this man is still unqualified for the office of president of the United States. Don't let down voters have their way with this comment.	A few years ago I’d walk by this homeless woman every morning, and she was always asking for money for a cup of coffee. One cold morning I felt really bad for her, so I decided to give her some change I had in my pocket. That’s when she decided to pull a knife on me and demand all my money.
If you were raised being taught masturbation was wrong, or just not masturbating, did you have wet dreams all the time?	When my mother caught me jerking off she grounded me. Then interrogated all my friends to find out who taught me about it. She never knocked when she came in to my bedroom. When a girl called my house I got grounded for an entire summer. She wasn't religious though, she was 15 when I was born and I think that played in to it. As far as wet dreams, I've never had one. I've been able to masturbate to orgasm since I was 5 though. I wonder if that has anything to do with it.	I've got to let one out at least every other day or it's wet dream city. And my wet dreams are always fucking strange and not sexy. Like I'll be a really horny midget and I'm chasing this girl midget through a crowded mall and she'll only let me fuck her through a picture frame she's carrying around, but the damn mall cops keep coming after us with brooms when I finally catch her. It's a mess.
UPDATE: I've just started letting my SO sleep with other women. Should I worry that it will affect his feelings for me?	Why on earth would you willingly accept such an arrangement? Don't you have any agency or self respect? If my girlfriend insisted on sharing I'd be out of there in a heartbeat.	> He didn't feel much of a connection and apparently wasn't interested in sleeping with her without it. As a woman who has browsed reddit a lot I was almost as disbelieving as you are. I don't find that hard to believe at all. I think you've been reading the wrong parts of Reddit.
What was your biggest "It's not what it looks like" moment?	Sharing a bed with an engaged friend while we spooned and watched Disney movies. I know that to outsiders it looks like an excuse, but he really was just that good a friend.	Well I'll answer this but it's nothing to do with sexy time. In college there was a massive pond near by with all sorts of waterfowl and I used to joke around with my foreign housemate about how delicious they looked, which horrified my poor housemate. Now our flat was on the ground floor and one day, having left the window wide open, I walked into the kitchen to find a very confused and unhappy duck. I'm pretty used to handling animals but this duck gave me a bit of a runaround. I finally managed to get the duck in a safe handling position so it couldn't flap when my housemate walked in. Picture: me, standing by the oven, holding a distressed duck. "PM_ME_FLUFFY_BUTTS WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PUT THAT DUCK DOWN!"
What is your advice for making a relationship work in the long-term?	As far as I know this is a relatively newer concept but when you end up living together, keep separate rooms. You don't need to smush all your stuff together into one space- it's actually healthier for you two as individuals to retain your own private sanctuary when you need alone time. You can always sleep in one or the others bed together, but it's good to have your own space in a relationship that's all about togetherness you know? And to echo everyone else, appreciation and continuing to "date" each other. Making sure to get dressed up and go out on dates every few weeks is important. Communicating and "learning how to fight" properly so to speak and express yourselves healthily without making it personal and attacking them. Expressing appreciation for them.	Communication, try not to assume your partner knows exactly what you're feeling. And never stop dating your partner or falling into a comfortable lull, because then it starts to feel like two friends just living together.
Women with mental health issues, what was the moment when you decided to seek treatment/help?	When I was fed up with being completely miserable all the time. I'd probably been depressed for about 15 years by that point.	The actual catalyst to make me get a therapist was that I spent an entire weekend awake because the dogs next door barked all night long and I couldn't focus on anything but the fact that the dogs were barking. I realized that's not normal. However I also had enough of worrying about everything, being scared of everything, being tired all the time, feeling so lonely, of my world being so small, and I couldn't live like that anymore. The catalyst for going on meds came a few months later when I had a public meltdown in a salon. I was physically unable to stop crying and shaking and realized that the anxiety was out of my control. I wish i had done this years and years ago. It's hard to carry and unpack all the emotional baggage and it takes longer the more you carry.
What's the hardest lesson you had to learn in life?	Nobody deserves anything in life. If you want something, you'll have to earn it. You don't get a prize for going through hardship. People who are less fortunate than you are working harder to achieve the same goals as you so there's really no reason for you to slack off. No matter what you've been through, there are others who have been through worse and are now doing better than you. So, really, where you end up in life is only a consequence of what choose to do; you can't push the buck to "circumstances".	Mother is not always right. Or nice, or kind, or even reasonable. It's hard to unlearn things that were deeply ingrained into your childhood.
What do I do about potential employer asking for pictures of me "enjoying life"?	Tell them you won't and why you find it wrong. It's not professional to ask for those in an interview.	I see two possibilities here. Either like a lot of people are saying, they are just weird and cult like. But the other possibility I see is that maybe they are using it as a way to get at things that are illegal to ask in an interview. For example if one of your pictures showed you with a beer but the owner is mormon or if they showed you with kids and they were trying to avoid people with kids due to extra sick days they often take.
What's your shitty superpower?	I can induce dizziness on myself by only thinking about it, it usually takes like 5 minutes max to become dizzy. Edit: Without having to spin around or any physical activity. Edit2: Just realized this is AskWomen, oh well.	Being in the way. Somehow, no matter where I stand or which way I move, I am *always* in someone's way.
How much did giving birth cost you?	My sanity. My body. My freedom. My selfishness. My laziness. My complete and total lack of direction in life. All. Gone. ;) Love my kiddos.	I have insurance and I had complications. I paid about 15k all said and done for labor, delivery, recovery and baby care. That’s not including the 4K I owed to my OB for prenatal visits for 9 months.
If make-up became mainstream for men, what new beauty norms would you expect/want to see for men?	I'd hate to see that happen. I don't find makeup appealing for either gender, and it would suck if men started to feel like they had to wear it.	I'd love to see better skincare all around, not really makeup. Sunscreen and some foot lotion could make such a difference.
What is something you ladies of reddit need to get off your chest?	One of my professors has a dry mouth and makes those annoying smacking sounds that people who don't hydrate make when they speak. I don't wanna judge him because we all have our own battles and he might be going through something (some meds give you dry mouth) but its like nails on a chalk board for me. Also, like the only girl in my class who's prettier than me sits next to me and I cant even hate her because she's super nice and we have a lot in common and actually we're kind of becoming friends. Damn it. She brought me starbucks today because she's so nice. This is far from my worst problem in life, just the one I feel like complaining about.	I'm hung up on a guy and I'm mad at myself for letting this happen. We were coworkers/friends for several months and once I changed jobs we started hanging out more (restaurants, bowling, etc). But recently he's been pretty curt with our conversation. This past weekend it took him more than a day to respond to my question "how was the movie?" And all he said was "it was good." At that point the message was clear. So I'm going to stop initiating contact. It sucks because I really like this guy, but at least we don't work together anymore.
Does anyone else find that girls aren't often physically attractive until you've gotten to know them?	My experience is quite the opposite. I find myself attracted to a great many girls. But the ones I get to know more personally eventually grow comfortable and put less effort into looking nice, which makes me less attracted to them. The happy middle for me is never letting a girl know all my secrets, and never letting her get too comfortable.	I'm interested in hot girls phyiscally, but often times the magic fades the second they open their mouth. Not having a nice personality or any intrinsic qualities is a huge deal breaker for me. Whereas there have been plenty of average girls who I didn't notice at first, but have then absolutely charmed me and I've found irresistable. Getting to know a girl a little is a really critical part of my attraction, I could never take a girl home, do the deed without saying a word and then call her a cab. I wouldn't enjoy that at all. But I have had a few one night things where we've really hit it off and built up a good rapport, *then* gone home.
Why is a woman's sexual history so goddamn important?	It's... not? I dunno. Some guys can't wrap their heads around that they aren't the only one you've had, or the best one you've had, or that there's a huge grey area between having a sexual history and plowing through the entire roster of the New York Knicks. Though I gotta admit the exasperated tone of your question made me giggle. It's like someone bursting into a room and bellowing this question in exasperated rage, like everyone from the middle-aged lady at the coffee drive-thru to the mailman to the people you ride the elevator with is asking "so how many? honest."	I'm not really interested in casual sex and I'm not really interested in someone who is. Like, live your life, there are many and better men out there than me, but I'm not interested.
How have you been fortunate in life?	My dad work expat. I look after the house for him, but in reality I live there rent free and just cover running costs.	My parents were 1st generation immigrants. My mother, at one point, literally lived in the jungle and my dad grew up in a European orphanage. I was able to get a good education, and an interesting career partly from the values they instilled in me. My wife is beautiful, and came with ... financial benefits (there's no way around it, it has added to my quality of life). We are financially stable, with my only debt being an investment property I bought before getting married. We have a beautiful 2 year old girl, who randomly hugs me and tells me she loves me. We are contemplating a second. I'm living in a goddamned dream and I don't want to wake up.
What's the worst sex you ever had and what made it so bad?	I don't get all the smelly vag stuff, I've fucked like 70 or 80 women and almost all of them either had no smell or taste or a pretty mild smell or taste. Women are usually immaculate when it comes to sexual hygiene.	She full on slapped me as hard as she could right across the face. Im okay with a little light roughness but that hurt. Definitely killed the mood.
What have you learned from your past relationships?	Blowjobs are non negotiable. I’m not sorry. I don’t have many needs and blowjobs are definitely one of the only things keeping me sane.	There's no such thing as "waiting for things to get better on their own". Also being more considerate. Taking an interest to the other person's hobbies is huge too. I recently got into D&D and I never thought in a million years that my SO would like it, but she loves playing. So in return I make an effort to do more special date nights etc as my way of thanking her for taking an interest.
Interracial couples of AskMen: What is something you experience that you think other couples probably don’t?	Jesus, I’m glad I don’t live in America. The idea of being glared at or being called a “race traitor” for dating someone of a different ethnicity is crazy.	My wife says she gets a lot of stink-eye from white women, and a lot of wink-nods from black women. I don't notice any of this and nobody has ever said anything racist to me about it, but at a club once I got fist-bumped by a random black man. I was confused and my wife had to explain to me what it was about.
Men of reddit, what would be your tips/insight/advice to a woman dating a guy who has never been in a serious relationship?	Don't try for sex until later in the relationship (makes you seem a little trashy), don't ever ever send nudes, in fact try to keep it as IRL as possible. Don't make sexuality or the internet the basis of the relationship. Be honest and straightforward. Be supportive about the never been in a relationship thing but not scolding.	Lots of talking. Communication is key. It's really that simple. And of course don't have any expectation for sex early on. It will probably suck.
Do you weigh yourself regularly, and how does the number on the scale affect your mood?	I stopped weighing out of laziness a couple weeks ago and oops gained 8lbs. So now I’m back to weighing every day. If I don’t see the number, I wild out.	I've studied nutrition and always try to let everyone worried about weight know something important that isn't common knowledge... For ALL PEOPLE: depending on the food you eat (sodium levels and other factors) your weight can change by up to 5lbs (2.268kg) in a single day! This is not actual fat but just water retention falsely making you seem heavier. for WOMEN: around that time of the month, weight can change ANOTHER 5LBS (2.268kg) on top of the other food related 5lbs. That means at any given time, your weight can change and be up to 10lbs more than your actual weight IN A SINGLE DAY! this is the reason many personal trainers and nutritionist tell you to weigh yourself only once a week, first thing in the morning (after you pee, before you drink or eat anything) because it's the most accurate way to see the true +/- amount.
Any other women totally terrified about pooping when people are around?	Most women in my office go to a different floor to do it. I actually appreciate the fact that there's one less gender funking up the hallways with poop odors. I used to date a girl who would often stay over on weekends but leave abruptly on Sunday. I had a REALLY small apartment at the time. I couldn't really figure out why but now I get it. I appreciate the gesture but would prefer if she just pooped, took a shower and hung out a bit longer. I didn't want her to be uncomfortable around me though and I suspect she would have been if she blew up the bathroom in my tiny apartment.	Meh. not really. I sleep over at my boyfriend's house for 24+ hours sometimes and at some point, nature will call. Poop is poop. Just a part of life. He does it too!
If a woman tells you you're attractive or starts hitting on you, do you ever assume it's some kind of prank or otherwise not genuine even if it is?	"...I simply cannot know if I'm attractive..." You can get feedback from /r/rateme. What women find physically attractive varies pretty widely.	If a girl is that direct about it, I don't get as suspicious as opposed to when she is just acting generally flirty. If a girl who otherwise ignores me when we're together starts talking to me like she loves me I can almost guarantee I'm about to get asked if I can do something, give a ride, sell something, etc. It really irks me and makes me want to be like "bitch, you never talk to me ever now you want a ride and you think I'm the chump who is going to do it for you because you are being flirty with me all of a sudden?" It really just depends on my mood at that point. I don't have any standard reaction, sometimes I do what they are asking, sometimes I politely say no and sometimes I'm a dick about it.
23 year old guy and I look like I'm 16. Girls my age have never liked me, and when 18/19 year olds find out my age they back away after initially being interested. What can I do?	Female here. I met my future husband when I was 16 and we started dating when I turned 19. He is 4.5 years older than me. Additionally, my best friend met her fiancé when she was 22 and he was 34. They are very happy together. The girls who care about your age difference aren't mature enough to date you. Don't fret. There are many women who would be happy to date regardless of age difference.	I'm just like you buddy, except I'm Asian. So I look even younger than my already young self. I'm 26 and today I've found out a 21 year old looks older than me. Tbh dressing and mannerisms change the age you project mostly. Don't mind the ribbing it'll come and go. Just be more self confident and grow yourself as a person. A couple of years back I had the same problem as you. Objectively I still look like I'm 20 but after 2 minutes with me, no one asks how old I am anymore. Fun story: when I was working as a hospital cleaner, all the clothes they had were too big so I looked really child like in my uniform. The nurses would ask me if I've signed in for school that day. They were shocked to learn I was doing my master's on the side.
Men who have done white collar and blue collar jobs: Which do you prefer, and why?	Programming > blue collar > white collar > retail I don't really like white collar, but I love programming so it overrides it.	I prefer white collar jobs because I have made more money doing so with stable hours. I loved doing the blue collar jobs though, just so much more interesting day to day work. It was nice getting a solid workout every day without hitting the gym and an actual sense of accomplishment. I didn't like the unsteady work flow and at times the hours were completely random. If I could work a blue collar job with the current pay and guaranteed (stable) hours, I would most likely switch over for a few years.
What are some overrated personality traits and why?	Kindness. Sorry, but I don't see the point in just being nice to everything and everyone. We are humans, we have a lot of bad things in us. Hiding them won't make them go away. If you just let yourself not to be kind, you would find out that you don't have to be always kind to be a good person.	Over use of sarcasm. It's like herbs for cooking. A little sarcasm can spice things up but a whole meal of it is bitter and unpalatable.
In a romantic/flirtatious context, what was the most impressive/surprising thing a woman has done to you?	She fought me over a $140 check at a seafood place after she drove me, on our first date, to the city and walked along the river. I didn't give it up without a fight. Very shameful but I had two whole dollars so she did save my ass. One bill, one in my checking lol. I could have covered it, but it'd have been a pain with a family card and giving it back to the account.	Well, it's kind of boring compared to previously posted stories, but what the heck. I was leaving my uni with a lady-colleague of mine. As we walk out, we realise that it suddenly became incredibly cold and windy and she had neither jacket nor coat. I took off my jacket and gave it to her. When we came to the subway, she took it off and thanked me. I wanted to take it back, but instead she walked around me and put it on my shoulders. This little gesture... Nobody has ever done that to me. Not even my ex. To this day, the memory of this act of kindness warms my heart.
Fellow men, how do I stop being a "Nice Guy"?	Read no More Mr. Nice guy by Robert Glover. It changed my life. And presented me with knowledge I had no idea existed.	Covert contracts are common with Nice Guys. I.e: doing something and expecting to receive specific things back without stating them. (and getting upset when people don't live up to/deliver on those expectations).
Does seeing other people's lives play out on facebook ever make you depressed?	Not at all. My feed is full of drama from extended family and friends. Most live in a tiny town, so it's town drama. Uncle J found out that his wife is sleeping with half the town...again, cousin A is in jail...again, and Aunt L has recieved her 3rd cancer diagnosis (made by the lady she gets herbal remedies from, not the doctors.) I ignore what gets posted by all but a select few. If I'm having a rough day, I log on and remind myself that no matter how hard things are, I'm not as screwed up as they are. It makes for a great laugh, and it works better than a shot of liquor.	Something to keep in mind: Facebook is the curated collection of people's greatest hits. People post things that will make their lives look awesome. That glosses over all the boring, normal, and terrible shit that happens day-to-day. That said, it might be best to ignore status updates for those people. Or go cold-turkey on Facebook altogether. I had to do that when I was unemployed for a while.
What are the things that make sex amazing (as opposed to 'meh') for you?	Superficial but honest- he’s got to have a hot body. It’s hard for me to get off with a dad bod	I think being with someone who wants you to enjoy yourself but also doesn't take it too seriously is the best, because I want them to care about my needs but also be able to laugh if things go wrong!
What do your breakdowns really look like?	A really ugly, hard cry alone in the shower. When things are REALLY bad I don't want to see or talk to anyone until I can let it out alone.	As soon as I get home: ugly crying, burrito-ed in bed with all my pillows. Before I get home: a dead, blank stare and more RBF than usual.
Guy at my sandwich place asked me out...where do I get my BLT now?! What was the last awkward situation you were in?	Ugh the guy at the convenience store right by my apartment asked me out the other day and now I have to drive down the road to buy beer. So I know how you feel. Serious bummer.	Not lately, but at my old job I would get breakfast at a Chikfila regularly, and usually got the same guy. After a month or so, I guess he got up his courage and asked me a BARRAGE of questions at the drive-thru window. Where did I work? When? Until when? Was it nearby? When did I get off? When exactly? I kept answering really vaguely because I'm nice and I don't mind questions, but I'm also very private. I don't even tell friends where I'm expected to be during the day most of the time. He kept wanting to get more specifics, I'm guessing because he wanted to propose a date time, but I was like "wow look at the time, gotta go, bye" and NEVER RETURNED. Thanks for the weight loss from not getting breakfast there anymore, guy. Actually needed that.
In what ways don't you fit standard dating expectations?	I'm married to my job, I get restless if I stay in any one place longer than a year or two, I never take my phone with me when I go out (or I leave it in airplane mode until I need it to get an Uber) so it's almost impossible to get a hold of me when I don't want to be gotten hold of, and really, unless you actually live in my apartment, you're not going to get much of my time (and if you can't get hold of me much, you're not going to build enough of a connection with me to where moving in together isn't completely insane.)	IMO if the early stage is already a game of who texts or not then the person you are talking to isn’t the one
If you are invited out for drinks but you don't drink what do you do?	I always decline, but I'm also not a social person and dislike social environments, especially with alcohol. I don't like bars.	Soda water with a lime. If you don't want to make a big deal out of not drinking, it looks like a vodka soda. As a former bartender, I totally respect someone who can hang in a bar with their friends without drinking.
[Serious] What feels better than running your chin hair on the back of a dog's head?	**Your post has not been removed, this is just FYI.** AskMen does not moderate for the [Serious] tag like AskReddit. If you are concerned about your question not being taken seriously, you may want to consider removing it and rewording it. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskMen) if you have any questions or concerns.*	ever had your ear canal cleaned by syringing? the basic concept is that a *qualified medical personnel* squirts a syringe of water like solution into your ear. the solution breaks down the grease/wax build up quite deep inside, and you tip your head to let it flow back out. that feeling you get as it flows out is amazing, its like getting a blowjob for the first time but the tip is the inside of your ear. do that whilst you spank the monkey and have a bidet squirt a stream of warm water on your anus at the same time.
Why are there so many female women's rights activists/feminists that are transphobic?	I have yet to encounter one of these supposed "many" transphobic feminists, but I sure do hear a lot about them from anti-feminists, so I'm starting to think they're just part of the "radical TERF feminists boogyman" that anti-feminists like to talk endlessly about making it seem like they're all over when really they're just a tiny subset of nutjubs which every group of any type has.	Well in 2nd wave feminism there's this big idea that differences between men and women are mostly social constructs and not inherent in brain structure. 2nd wave feminists don't believe that it's possible to "feel" like one gender over the other and if you do it's because society has forced us into this false gender binary. So many of them don't think that it's possible for someone to be trans.
How do you feel when you see your friends are gradually getting married?	To each their own. I enjoy my freedom too much to bind myself together too much. I love my current so but I just prefer the freedom to get up and leave without consequences if I felt like it.	Probably going to be an unpopular opinion here: I'm really happy for them but I also get envious and feel kind of left behind as I'm nowhere near that stage and a part of me wishes that I am.
Have you ever cock-blocked someone deliberately?	All the time when I see some douchebag hitting on one of my friends. Usually I come from behind, give her a kiss on the cheek and say "Who is this guy, sweetheart?" Why am I doing this? Because I'm a douchebag myself and I don't feel empathy for other dudes. It is fun, faces these guys are making are fuckin priceless. Also, my female friends seem to like it. Situation like this led to hookup twice (it wasn't my goal, we just got carried away I guess)	My friend cockblocks me for fun. I set him up with a girl and he's now over 3 years with her. I told him once he could repay the favour and all he does is throw me on the deep end. 'This is my friend packs, and he likes bukkake' and 'Who's your female friend? Will she be having breakfast with us tomorrow?' are not something you shout out when I'm talking to a girl!
What seemingly small or insignificant things have you come to realize are important to you in a relationship?	The smallest of the small: Not using the term 'LOL', except sarcastically. To expand on it, I really love it when someone's a bigger nerd about using proper English than I am. My last SO used the term 'one', and it really did something for me. I've always wished that I had the confidence to do that.	LATENESS. This makes me so mad. It's super disrespectful. If I'm waiting for you and we made plans, and I took the time to get ready and be there for you when we agreed to meet, you can do the decency of doing the same.
A girl I've been talking to recently told me she still has feelings for a guy she used to see who cheated on her multiple times. What do I do?	Just be careful. It's possible after that after she chooses him(if) that she might come back later. Don't hold your breath, but it is semi possible	Cut her off. You deserve 100% from someone. You can't expect that from someone that has feels for someone else. It sucks, but you'll be better off spending time looking for someone that can dedicate herself to you.
I lost my 3rd job in 9 months......What am I doing wrong??	where are you from? must really suck if employers can just sack you like this. blame the system, where they can just kick you out at will, honestly. There could be really lame reasons behind why you were fired but nobody will be held accountable so they're good enough.	I'm going to answer bluntly Most people I hear that say they don't know why they keep getting let go from so many jobs are fooling themselves about their abilities, or even why they were let go in the first place. > Small company, fired because I was late. Even though I was salaried and No, it matters. You were late. There's a start time and people depended on you to be there. People likely said "Damn, I need to talk to Dante, but he's not here yet". > had made mistakes but they were technical, minor, easily fixed Mistakes add up $$$. Are you sure it was a few minor mistakes, and not something much much larger
It's October 1st! What are you being for Halloween this year and what is the best Halloween costume you've ever worn?	Nothing, and I've never been trick-or-treating. Its an american thing, right? So weird. We have a pedophile in our neighborhood, it would never work here.	I'm going to be Dr Strange. My wife makes amazing costumes. Scratch that. She and I will go naked, painted brown. We'll be chocolate bars, one with nuts, one without.
Ok so I'm at a bar and I'm all liquored up and there is are a lot of very pretty girls here. But they are all in groups. How can I talk to one individual when shes with her friends?	Warning beforehand: Expect to be buffered out by the group as a whole. Buy a round for one of the groups, but don't be flashy. Tell the bartender there next round is on you or something. See if one of them comes to you. That's my safest and least-cringey advice amigo. Good luck.	Rule for next time: Don't go to the bar alone. It's MUCH easier if you have one or two other people.
Guys of Reddit with hot girlfriends, how do you deal with all the sleazes that hit on her regularly and how does it make you feel?	I met her last year. I'm 25 she's 25. She was a virgin and everyone tried to get with her but she turned them all down because she wanted them to wait a while to bang her and they weren't up for the challenge. She's been that pedestal girl in the community that was the perfect partner and wife because she was beautiful, smart, and had a class. Now I have her. When guys hit on her I don't even need to step in. She just tells them like it is and they are on their way. Can confirm she was virgin before I fucked her because my dick would not fit for the first week of trying every day.	I smile and carry on. If she's gonna cheat, ain't much I can do to stop it. I'd rather have a girl that chooses to be with me, than one who requires constant intervention just to keep her attention. Also, I don't date wimps. If a douchecanoe in the bar needs to be glassed, she'll handle it.
It's wedding season! What's the trashiest wedding you've ever been to?	Not really trashy but my husband has poor family members on his side. We were invited to a cousin's wedding so we went and it was on a campground in a park. Everyone brought their own food for potluck and no one was dressed to nicely and only wore regular clothes and we were the only ones dressed nicely. The only thing they had was a minister and he was someone in the family also so he did it for free and the wedding cake was just a regular cake. Most of the wedding presents were cards, I am assuming gift cards. This was one interesting wedding and when you don't have much money, there is a will, there is a way.	A friend of mine from high school met a guy through an online version of Prison Penpals while he was doing time for sexual assault of a minor. Within a couple weeks of him getting out of prison, she was pregnant. This would be his 5th kid with 4 different women. They got married at a barbecue joint a few months later and her dad wouldn't speak to anyone at the reception because he was so pissed that this was happening. They got divorced a couple months after the baby was born, and I think the bride's dad was much more excited to pay for the divorce than the wedding.
When have you accidentally been turned on?	Started hormonal replacement therapy 15 weeks ago as part of my transition. Before I started my transition, I could not tell if I was turned on or not. I usually assumed I wasn’t, and thought I was asexual for quite a long time. Turns out when you’re a female-to-male transgender person, you experience what’s called “bottom growth,” where your clitoris grows by a couple centimeters. It basically means you’ve got a micro micro penis. Also, because you’re essentially a teenage boy at this point, you’re horny all the goddamn time. These days, it’s better to count the times when I’m *not* horny.	Tens of thousands of times. Maybe hundreds of thousands. Far too many to get into specifics. This is like asking "When have you crossed a road?" All the time.
Anyone here a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000? Have a favorite episode?	Reptilicus is my favorite of the new ones Of the old ones PumaMan is a favorite of mine. Though my SO would argue that Manos Hands of Fate is the very best one of them all.	Reptilicus is my favorite of the new ones Of the old ones PumaMan is a favorite of mine. Though my SO would argue that Manos Hands of Fate is the very best one of them all.
My friend told me I was asshole for ending the date with a woman because I didn’t met her requirements to have sexual relationship with her, How do I persuaded my friend that what I did was right for me ?	Yes, you were an asshole. But that's a good thing. Your choices were to be a doormat or an asshole. People like doormats. You can walk all over them, wipe dogshit off your shoes on them, it's great. That doesn't mean you want to be a doormat.	Dude if those are the requirements just to fuck her you dodged a huge bullet there... And your friend is an idiot.
Ladies, has your opinion on abortion changed over the years, and if so, what made you sway more Pro-Life or Pro-Choice?	I'm pro-life and believe abortion should be illegal in all cases. I used to be indifferent on the matter before realizing the evil of abortion, and the fact that to abort is to kill someone who cannot defend himself.	I've always been pro-choice. I heard too many stories from my grandma about what things were like in the days before birth control. My grandmother had several abortions in the thirties and forties that left her insides so ravaged, it was a miracle that she conceived my dad. A female relative had five daughters, and was very poor. She confided that she had three abortions, mostly because she was afraid of being able to feed the kids she already had. Things are different now. Women have a lot of contraceptive choices, yet having a choice is of utmost importance to me. I couldn't dream of a world where choices are taken away.
What's an unusual quality you look for in a girl?	Extreme level of fitness. I want a woman who's strong as shit, fast as shit and fucking *knows* it. I want a women confident enough in herself to walk outside in a fucking sports bra and yoga shorts and OWN that shit. I hate the timidness and nervousness present in most women.	If she's comfortable with silence. I sometimes just don't talk, or don't feel the need to talk, or don't want to talk. They have to be comfortable with a quiet guy. If they talk a lot, that's fine. They'll have my undivided attention. I just don't always feel the need to respond or say something if I don't have anything to add.
Any women out there raised by single dads? How do you feel this affected your connection to femininity?	Not single dad, but being the only girl between two brothers made me less girly, but in a weird way. I am a MUA, I like fashion but I used to hate pink ( I love it now) . I still struggle to connect with other woman because I don't like when they get whiny at stuff. This video is making an analysis about Stephanie Meyer, but talks about mysogin stuff I relate A LOT because I just loved Buffy and hated Twilight and it's fans so much! https://youtu.be/8O06tMbIKh0	I was. And I'm not sure that it had any affect, tbh. He gave us a wide birth to do pretty much whatever we wanted, and didn't press gender roles or performative femininity on us.
I'm always told I could have any guy I wanted. So why am I 30 years old and still single?	Welp, now that this thread has been linked to several corners of the reddit shit-o-sphere and run its course, we're locking it.

Describe a time you should have listened to your "gut feeling"?	I knew it was wrong to begin with. She was married. I was married. But the allure of a beautiful, much younger woman was too strong for me. She was plain about her past from the beginning, that this wasn't the first time she had been unfaithful. I knew I should have said no right at the first. But I didn't. I fell for her and now my life - and that of my wife and her husband - is in more turmoil than I could have imagined. I wish I'd done the right thing and listened to myself. A virtuous man would not be writing these words. And yes - I know - I'm getting everything that I deserve.	I always thought one coworker was creepy. It was the way he looked at women. It felt so slimy. I told a coworker about all the creepy vibes I got from him and totally got shrugged off. I avoided him as best as possible and fortunately did not have to interact with him much. He was fired for sexually assaulting a female coworker.
People who were reasonably pretty but became uglier at some point later in life: what happened and how did you deal with the change in appearence?	Honestly I think I've always been very average looking, but I *was* thin, blonde, and white. Since freshman year of college I've put on about 40lbs, and I'm still very average in terms of size (I wouldn't even call myself chubby, not because it's inaccurate, but because I wouldn't want to co-opt chubby girls' struggle, if that makes sense?) But wow, there was a clear turning point of me being fuckable to one day I wasn't. It doesn't like, bother me? In fact I think it's a fascinating exercise in privilege. Because I look basically the same, I just have some chub (and my personality is *way* better lol). So yeah.	I was attacked and left with large and obvious facial scarring. I've come to love my new exterior self - mostly because the inside person hasn't changed. She's the same badass she's always been.
What kind of women, in terms of background/past, would you never date?	Past? Who cares, as long as her present is ok? If there are things in her past that fuck up the present, like STDs, or being hunted by the FBI, that's one thing, but if she's right now, who cares if she wasn't beforehand?	In my experience, a woman who has had a long off-and-on-again relationship with someone. That's always going to hang in the background and leave you wondering "Am I just her 'rebound guy' until she gets back together with her ex?"
Anecdotally I've noticed a lot of male friends stay in unhappy relationships so much longer than my female friends. In your opinion, what are some of the reasons as to why?	Men are loyal and Think about the Past and what that women might have done for him. Women care only about how they feel in the Moment, loyalty is foreign concept for them.	We don't want to be alone. It's also hard for some of us to find a new partner due to any number of reasons.
Men of reddit, did you ever date a girl without being very interested in her, but she was quite into you? Why? Did things work out?	As one of my best friends said, “Anything is better than nothing”. And you just might find yourself more interested than you expected. He also said, “New is better than good”	Yeah, she was a nice girl but I really wasn’t into her, she was getting really attached and I didn’t feel the same way about her so I just broke things off. I still feel like an absolute asshole for breaking her heart even though she did some crazy stuff.
How do you feel about tending to your parents when they become old and need care?	I won't do it. I wouldn't want my kids to care for me, either. That's would be selfish and entitled of me to assume it of them. I can't anyway. I'd rather pay someone to do it.	Honestly, I worry about it a lot. I'm an only child, I'm barely scraping by financially, my parents have no money, and they don't care for their health as well as they could. I'll absolutely help care for them in whatever capacity they need but I'm worried I won't be able to.
On a first date, how do you physically greet a woman when meeting?	as a german, I raise my right arm and shout Hail Hytler ! On occasion I click my heels together at the same time, just to come across as really majestic and so forth. Only gets awkward when my date is of non aryan origin, but hey what can you do? Since I live in Berlin, we then go to the Holocaust Memorial Site and discuss how history should be written in books. trolling off course!	Don't go for a handshake unless you're meeting someone for the first time. For me - usually a wave or a hug. I usually go for hug because I like hugs.
What makes sex go from good to amazing for you?	When I feel like I don't have a shitton of pressure on me. Sex is too often like having an exam you didn't study for. All stress and nerves. Two reasons for that. 1- I'm responsible for my own satisfaction And 2- I'm responsible for her satisfaction. What her job is I have no idea, most of them seem to think showing up is sufficient. If I get time and opportunity to actually enjoy the act I'm in amazing territory.	When I can tell the noises she's making are more involuntary rather than "we're having sex so these are the noises I will make to keep him informed that I am enjoying myself", if that makes sense. When I can feel her quiver.
Women who started their relationship as "the other woman"- does it ever cross your mind that your partner will find another "other woman" when committed to you? How do you stop your mind from wandering?	I'm a man. This is the original starting reason that I've always been alone, still, at 33. I didn't want to ask a girl out if I felt there might be a chance that I would meet someone better while with her, and have to betray her in order to leave, and the other girl would know, and so how would she ever trust me? This, along with awkwardness, led me to never having had a girlfriend by my mid twenties, and after about that time, no woman wants a man that has no relationship experience, and so I missed my window. There are other things wrong with me too that I've tried to fix, but it's really too late now.	I started out my last relationship as the other woman and the trust that I had for him was so low from the start. We were with each other all the time and constantly keeping tabs on one another when we weren't together. I made no time for my friends and isolated myself from everything. I went from being confident and happy to embarrassingly insecure in myself and my relationship. So if you're thinking about it, just don't do it. There's so many other people out there and you should absolutely consider starting a relationship where you can trust the other person entirely because how it all started will always be in the back of your head.
Who else sucks at making new friends?	I seem to get along with people just fine, but after that really becoming friends, nope, it doesn't happen, also I became like a shitty friend since I got sick of trying to be a good friend to people and then just getting nothing in return. Most of the time I become friends with my girlfriends boyfriends since these are the people I see the most, but they (gfs) don't seem to like that.	I'm great at making casual acquaintances and I have NO fucking clue how to move from that to, like, actually making social plans with people.
A girl pulls the 'ol "Did I leave my earrings at your place?" trick but you don't want to see her again. How do you get out of this?	"Those were yours? I'm sorry, I gave them to . . . someone else . . . I could call her and ask for them back - I'm sure she didn't mean to. . .(click)."	Drop them off at her work, while she's working, to the receptionist. God forbid they were her deceased grandmother's, but you know how luck would have it.
Men browing this sub, what are you hoping to learn or what have you learned by hanging out here?	I've learned that women are so critical about every facet of the man's role in the relationship yet don't give men any hint to the fact they're being judged on every micro behaviour against some invisible scorecard of how men should behave. It's like women see men as some type of perceived level of how a man should be, then are constantly scoring them against that model in their mind. Down to quite intense levels of scrutiny that the men have no idea that they're even being judged against a list of qualities that the women has in her mind that she wants from him. &#x200B; That isn't a criticism, merely an observation on how different we are in our approach towards living with a potential partner.	Wasn’t hoping to learn one specific thing. Was just painfully aware that there was A LOT I didn’t know, so I joined hoping I could get some much needed perspective, a chance at seeing the picture from the other side...
Women of Reddit: What are some things that guys worry about or have insecurities about that most women don't care about?	I have always been attracted to bald men (shaved heads, whether they still grow a full head of hair or not) and find chest hair really attractive. I don't want to date a boy, I want to date a man, and the vast majority of men have chest hair. I think it's sexy. Embrace who you are and be confident about it. That's the sexiest thing of all. And if you're self-conscious about sparse hair on your head, just shave it all. It makes most men look younger, anyways.	Sexual stamina. Seriously I would much rather have a quickie, then some time spent on me, then another slower shag when the guy's recovered. There's nothing fun in lying there while a guy pumps away diligently, evidently doing his times tables to keep from coming. I WANT to turn you on. I WANT you to be so excited and pleased by me that you can't handle more than a few minutes. In time, when you get used to each other, you can take things slower. And obviously there's a cut-off point where it can get a bit exasperating, but just make sure you put the time in in other ways. The whole "I can last 45 minutes!" thing doesn't really help most girls out much. Porn is lying to you.
What's the worst/funniest/craziest thing you you've witnessed or have been involved with at your company Holiday party?	I used to work in a restaurant kitchen with all men. I'm not bad looking, when I try. I'm 5'7", skinny, with bright blue eyes, and long blond hair. However, whenever I went to work, I didn't put any effort into my appearance, didn't see the point. Hair thrown up, tied with a bandana, food stained uniform, not a drop of makeup. The holiday party came around. I got dressed up, did my hair and put on my usual face full of makeup. I actually had coworkers do a double take when they saw me. "I had no idea who you were at first". "Oh my god when you walked in the door, I wondered if you were the new waitress or something". "It just took me a good 10 minutes to realize that was you". That was a hilarious evening.	I live tweeted last years Holiday party. The company had hired an Elvis-impersonator magician, and my boss got incredibly upset because he kept doing magic tricks instead of getting right to the singing portion. It almost ended in fisticuffs. I no longer work for that company.
Everyone has that one girl they can't get out of their heads. What's she like? Are you with her?	She's not even that great. She just has a hold on me because of the passion, although it matters less and less as time goes on. We dated over two years, really connecting, but she was a selfish, insecure wreck with daddy issues, that legitimately could not be alone. I'm sort of broken and traumatized due to that relationship.	We never even dated. I've never felt more comfortable around someone of the opposite gender than I was around her. Our lives took separate paths and now I just hope we see each other again. Trying to figure out if I should try contacting her even though it has been a few years. I'd drop everything and go find her if I knew she would be happy to see me.
"Modern males can be deeply unhappy and unsatisfied with their place in the world, and have no clear idea how to fix it." How much do you agree, and what's your personal solution?	I think it can apply to both men and women. Personally, I've never felt terribly unsatisfied with my place in the world. Functionally, I'm an atheist-bordering-on-nihilist, but I've always been able to pick up the shovel and dig my way out of whatever shit has arisen. It's taken a lot of work and shitty experience, but nothing worth doing or having is ever easy. If you miss high school football, there's no reason you can't join a local football group or see if your company has a team they sponsor or something.	Honestly? I don't even know how the fuck to *be* a modern man. There are so many mixed messages, and so much toxic social baggage. No matter what I do, it feels like I'm never "man" enough for anyone. I'm 31, BTW. I thought I'd figure this out eventually, but it's only gotten less clear over time.
Guys who have been single for a long time (3+years) how has it affected your psyche?	It hasn't why would it? I've never got why some people need to be in a relationship. What's wrong with being happy with your own company and socialising with friends. I've never felt they need to actively go and seek out relationships if i meet someone who i get on really well with i'll ask her out but i don't actively search for such a thing.	I spent all of college and grad school single, then from 26-30. It just made me more secure in myself, comfortable being single, and unwilling to compromise myself for a relationship.
What media that was targeted directly at you was lost on you? What did you totally fall for?	Anything where a "strong female character" is treated like a selling point - everything from Buffy to Agent Carter to Parks and Recreation. No! I want to see female characters who fail, fuck up their jobs and their relationships, create bigger problems for themselves than they can solve alone, and otherwise get to be messy and genuinely flawed, not just "flawed" in cute Hollywood ways that get overlooked and solved by the end of every episode/movie. I don't want to see women who kick ass all the time, because I don't relate to that at all. Give me woman characters whose lives are in disarray but who are allowed to be real, three-dimensional protagonists (or antiheroes) by the narrative.	The impression I've gotten from ladies I've known is that all women are supposed to love Jane Austen in general and Pride and Prejudice in particular (I've known ladies who reread it every year) and, with apologies to Jane Austen fans, I couldn't stand that book. Yes, well-written; yes, a big deal historically. But I bounced off it really hard. But (switching ages here) I was totally the target demographic for Starring Sally J Freedman As Herself, and YA book or not, I still reread that, even in my thirties. That's almost exactly the kind of kid I was.
If you taught a high school English class, what 5 or 6 books would be on the curriculum?	As someone who was forced to read enormous piles of 'the classics' and hated almost all of them, here are my choices: She's Come Undone, by Wally Lamb A Prayer for Owen Meany, by John Irving I Who Have Never Known Men, by Jacqueline Harpman IT, by Stephen King The Harry Potter series, JKR I would love to focus on popfic, obviously, and really get kids/young adults into reading for pleasure. I thought I didn't like to read until I was about 14 or 15 years old. No, I *love* to read! I just don't like what the schools kept giving me.	A lot of Slaughterhouse Five in lists. I read it in 11th grade as part of an assignment where everyone chose a different book from a list to read and present on. It was marked as having "questionable content" as a warning. I had classmates who changed "damn" to "dang" and "god" to "gosh." I can only imagine the kind of drama that would ensue if they tried teaching it to all students. Good old Utah. (To answer the question: My favorite books during school were "Fahrenheit 451," "Animal Farm" and "The Count of Monte Cristo," so I'd include those. "Heart of Darkness" was read in my senior year and is probably my least favorite book ever. I'd definitely exclude it from my list.)
What’s the biggest misconception about what a healthy relationship should look like?	Absolute sexual and romantic monogamy. It's not for everyone, and that general view of healthy relationships IMO is a reason why divorce rates are so high and people cheat so much. Relationships are not always 50:50 either, and it's not fair to think it should be that way all the time. Healthy relationships fluctuate as needed. Some days it will be 90:10 one way, and others it will be 10:90.	That you love doing the same things. You might love doing a couple of the same things, but chances are you have your things, they have their things and sometimes you do them together simply because it's important to the one you love (but not really your favorite thing).
Gender Neutral Bathrooms: Aye or Nay, and why?	Bathrooms should be gender neutral but separated for #1 and #2, and that second one should be strictly enforced with severe penalties.	I'm all for people using whichever bathroom corresponds to their gender identity, and there's no reason why single-stall bathrooms shouldn't be gender neutral. But when my college introduced an all-genders bathroom with multiple stalls, there were so many issues with peeping and harassment (against men and women) that they ended up turning it into a single occupancy bathroom. IDK, I lean non-binary myself and it's nice to see recognition of non-binary genders in society, but from a practical standpoint I kinda think widespread gender neutral bathrooms create more problems than they solve. People who don't feel comfortable using mixed-gender bathrooms shouldn't be forced to do so.
Do you find more women ogling you, or more men ogling your girlfriend/wife?	When I was in a relationship I found that most guys were checking my girl out because she had half her boobs sticking out and always wore really short shorts. I didn't care since I was the one who got to sleep with her. But I always wondered why she couldn't just pull her fucking shirt up. Oh wait she was an attention seeking cunt.	I find more men ogling me. I have been told I'm the epitome of a bear. I am flattered every time. Does that count?
guys, what makes you insecure while dating?	Whether the girl I'm dating is cool about me having a wife. Before you bring out the pitchforks, its a joke.	I'm not used to thinking of myself as desirable, so it would take me quite a while to really accept that a partner is into me. The great length of time I've gone without managing to get a single date only reinforces that insecurity.
Women who cohabitate, what's the best thing about living with your SO?	You all are making me sad that I have to do long-distance for nine months while I finish my grad degree and my SO starts hers across the country.	Pros: I have a personal heater in my bed during the winter. Cons: I have a personal heater in my bed during the summer.
What Common Saying About Women Bothers You?	Anything about them being the exact same as men and that all differences aside from biological ones are ~social constructs.~ E: all answers are valid, yo	Any of those incredibly douchey t-shirts that show things like a dude getting married with the words "Game Over." IF YOU HATE WOMEN SO MUCH, WHY ARE YOU MARRYING ONE?!
Some men say some vaginas are better than others, others say it’s all the same. What’s the difference in different vaginas? What makes sex with a certain woman better than others?	Really the only thing that changes how they feel is if the person is fit /does kegels in my experience. I had a stint where I dated some dancers, (strippers) who of course were super fit given the nature of spinning and boy did it make a difference. I understood why wives/girlfriends got so insecure after visiting the clubs after that.	Vaginas vary as much as penises do. Her depth, tightness at her opening, tightness inside, internal heat, wetness, shape/size/color of vulva and clitories, level of sensitivity, etc can all vary wildly, and even in the same person from start to finish or where she in in her cycle. I'm not very fond of super tight/shallow situations, but sex emcompasses so much more than the physicality of our genitals. What makes the sex better with any woman is how self aware, communicative, creative, rhythmic, and enthusiastic she is, regardless of what she's working with.
What is an immature or unrealistic relationship expectation that you've encountered or think is too common in today's society?	"Once a cheater, always a cheater" is a big pet peeve of mine. I'm not saying that you should date someone who has been a serial cheater in the past and expect things to be totally different with you, but I am say that there are massive gray areas and that a whole lot of people can actually grow and change. Just because Sally kissed Johnny playing spin the bottle at her 13th birthday party when she was dating Timmy doesn't mean she should be banned from dating for the rest of her life.	My comment is for relationships that are ending: *Just because the relationship ended doesn't mean it was a failure.* Maybe you two just grew incompatible. Maybe one of you moved away and one or neither wanted a long distance relationship. Whatever the case may be, I feel like whenever a couple breaks up, people assume that something is wrong with one of the people in the relationship, or that the relationship was bad. These things *do* happen, but I don't like to think that this applies to *all* ended relationships. IMO, as long as both people were able to grow and are better people for having dated each other, it's hardly a failure.
What do I do if my girlfriend of a year is greatly opposed to me getting in shape?	Find a new gf at the gym. You shouldn't be with someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you possibly could be.	She's seeing everything she thinks she ought to do but doesn't want to do. It makes her feel bad because she can't ignore it now that it's in her face.
What's the best story about yourself you had to be told the next day?	Anytime I got passed first base in college it something I had to be told about later. While in college I could be blacked out and still be coherent enough to seem like was just buzzed. Other times I would remain conscious and get falling down drunk.	Woke up on my couch with a dead phone. I got into my bed so hungover and plugged in my phone. The mass amount of texts that started coming in from all different people was crazy because they were all sent while the phone was dead. **I had made out with a professor two nights before graduation**
Going to be having a girl over for the first time in nearly a year. Any prep tips?	Vacuum your floor. People walking around barefoot will feel every crumb and peice of plastic on the floor. Oh, and tampons too.	Tidy the place, fresh bed sheets, baby wipes in the bathroom, cut and file your finger nails and get some snacks/drinks. Just relax and enjoy yourselves.
What is something you want to complain about, but complaining about it would come off as a humblebrag?	I've fucked 4 new chicks this week and it's stupid. They all want to hangout after and it's super annoying	I feel like a dick for ever posting on social media so i don't. It feels like everything, even complaining, comes off as bragging. I moved away from my home town and live by the beach, year round perfect weather, in a nice house, I'm in great shape, I just feel like a huge asshole.
Frizzy medusas of Reddit, what are some do's and don't's regarding your mane of snakes?	Medusas? I'm seeing a lot of people with curly hair replying, but that's usually a term for women with dreadlocks. Can you clarify?	No hairbrushes. Ever. No sulfates. Much conditioner. Don't play with hair unless you want to look like a crazy cat lady. No tight braids, no tight elastics, no heat styling. No ammonia in hair color. When shampooing, wash scalp only. Leave conditioner until right before exiting the shower. No fluffing hair with a towel- wrap it (just tight enough to stay put) and leave it alone.
For those of you that love the fall, how do you make October feel extra special?	I’m in the southern hemisphere, so I’m sitting here happily not wearing 3 layers of clothes and enjoying the sun!	I like to go on drives out to the country to see the leaves changing colors. My parents started the tradition when I was small after they realized how much I loved fall, and it's always something that will be special to me. I also like going apple picking and to pumpkin patches.
What are some problems that short girls face?	I used to have a huge problem with pants being too long, but then I started wearing more skinny type pants, any ones that i can just cuff instead of having to get them hemmed. Sometimes I can find pants with the perfect inseam, which is great	This is in combination with not wearing a ton of noticeable makeup, but people constantly assume I'm a teenager or worse. Last summer I went to check out of a hotel, and I was asked if I'm old enough to check out. The lady thought I was 12. Wtf?! I'm 25! Yes, I get that when I'm in my thirties and forties, it's going to be great to have my age underestimated, but I feel like I'm an easy target for being talked down to, mugged, and the like because everyone assumes I'm a little girl.
Do any men actually find heels attractive?	I think heels make women walk funny, and in general are not sexy. Exception: Heels, long long legs with really short skirt, patterned mesh stockings or really long sox. And a simple sleeveless loose top, revealing the midriff. No bra. dancing equals sexy	Yes, I think they can make a girl look more attractive. But it's not very attractive if you can barely walk when you're wearing them.
What is a healthy alternative you treat yourself with after a bad day or heartache, rather than chocolate cake or junk food?	~~How about starving myself?~~ Nah seriously that's it. I don't have healthy coping ideas except for maybe rewatching your favourite tv show.	I know most people are suggesting alternative food items, but I usually just give myself extra bodily pampering instead. I’ll take extra steps in my skincare routine, like a mask, teeth whitening, do my nails. Maybe go to the spa, get a massage. Helps to feel cute and taken care of on the outside, at least.
What do you wish you knew before living on-campus in college?	If you live in a co-ed dorm, you have to be just as worried about getting groped, flashed, etc as you do on the street. Carry something that can be used as a weapon as real weapons, including pepper spray, aren't allowed. Flashlights, umbrellas, and textbooks can work in a pinch.	This sounds bad, but if you share a room, do not be overly accommodating when working out your roommate agreement. If you know you'll feel uncomfortable with others sleeping in the room, let it be known. Anything like that, don't try too hard to be cool. Also, talk about problems as soon as they arise, rather than waiting until it's a huge issue. If you like peace, considering living in the quiet dorm. Of course, you can always go out to parties, but quiet dorms tend to be chill and focused on studies. Going to college is a huge adjustment. Living away from home is a huge adjustment. Many people struggle. Don't be afraid to reach out for help, whether it's your family, on campus services, or friends.
I need some happy thoughts - what good stuff has happened to you recently?	I'm a woman but I really REALLY have to answer this! I've been working as a temp since Nov 2012 and in the same position with the same company since Aug 2013. I just got word from my boss's boss's boss that I am being hired as a perm employee and the transition should complete by next week. Not only is that going great for me, but they also offered me $6k more than what I currently make!!!!! This means that I can take on more student loans and I can pay off my taxes because I couldn't do that the last 2 years and have worked with the IRS. My life is finally looking a lot better (not that it wasn't good, just better!)	I've been consistently working out. I've stopped drinking. I've stopped caring about finding a girlfriend. I'm just working on me, and I love it :D
Women of reddit who had to end a relationship due to physical or emotional abuse, how did it start?	The very first red flag I remember was when my ex told me that the girl he'd had sex with the night before had a much tighter vagina and throat than I did (we were non-monogamous). When I tried to express how much that hurt to hear he pulled the whole "I'm just being honest! You don't want me to be honest??" shit, which ended up being his justification for most of the shitty things he'd say to me. Abusers will only change if they somehow learn to accept responsibility for the effects that their actions have on others. I've yet to meet an abuser who is capable of this, and I would *never* recommend putting up with abuse in the hope that it'll change. Even if you're aware that it's happening that shit changes you in ways that you cannot guard yourself against.	I saw red flags literally the first week we started talking. I was single and in college, and met him at a party. We talked and hung out and it was clear we were both interested. I was at his place a few days after we met, and he saw a text come through to my phone from a guy, and he flipped. That was the first sign and the beginning of an emotionally abusive relationship. There is so much more to it, but you asked for the start.
When Did You Realize That Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault Was Commonplace for Women?	I've never had this happen to me before because i'm a guy but fck. Wtf is wrong with people. I would beat the crap out of anyone that ever tried to do this to my mom or sister. Reading your experiences makes me realize why girls are so cautious being alone around guys. It makes me angry to think people would do fcked up shit like harrasment & be okay with it.	I was 13 the first time I got catcalled. It was my 30 something neighbors making comments about my developing breasts and how that meant I was reafy to be fucked. I didn't really understand what was going on so I told my mom. My mother's face was just so resigned. Not furious, just resigned. And I knew then that I shouldn't expect it to stop anytime soon.
I understand the allure of a proper blowjob, but what's attractive about watching a woman swallow another man's semen (or more specifically, lots of men's semen)?	Holy fuck all these comments and not one of you pointing out the honest truth. Some guys like to see a woman demeaned and humiliated. Fuck all that "she enjoys my cum" bullshit lol. That's only when it's one on one. The scenes with multiple dicks and loads of cum are because it turns some of us on to see a woman used like a fuck toy with total disregard for her feelings or enjoyment. It's that feeling when you crush a sports rival on the field except you're doing it to a woman. You totally destroy her and unload your worst on her. You're conquering her and using her body as the spoils.	for me the attractive part is that the girl is enjoying something she would usually be disgusted by because she is too horny to care. Of course the porn star is not horny and is being disgusted, but that's not what I see when I watch the video.
Experienced men of reddit. What are some things about women you've seen that an inexperienced person is unlikely to believe?	Lots more girls have a cnc fantasy than you would think. I bet it's at 30 percent. # Edit: it's rape role play. You guys need to get out more.	Some women can think very highly of their own looks and sex appeal while also having terrible self esteem about everything else. I've spoken to more than a few women who knew they were very attractive but feel otherwise worthless and don't like themselves much. It's really sad.
What are easy mistakes girls can make to screw up a new relationship?	Blind siding a guy with a deep question like "where do you see this relationship going?" when you're doing something otherwise really casual like watching TV or something. (Edit: I should probably point out that this is absolutely not limited to women. Men should be careful about asking this question too - it's an important question and it's courteous to give your partner some advance notice that it's coming, regardless of genders.)	Refusing to tell me when things are bothering her. Look, I'm not stupid. I can tell when something has you pissed off or upset. If you don't talk to me about it, we can't hammer it out, and you're just going to stew on it and resent me for it. Then eventually, you're going to blow up on me over something very, very small, and unleash this explosion of molten crazy over all this shit you refused to talk to me about.
Ladies, what makes you feel an emotional bond with your SO?	Firstly, you have to make sure you don't fuck too many guys or you'll lose your ability to pair bond completely and you'll be consigned to being a cheating nympho for the rest of your days. /s	Good conversation! I always start to feel like I'm losing a connection if we have the same conversations over and over, but I feel really good about the relationship when we actually discuss something new, no matter what it is.
What's your current trivial frustration that you can't vent about because it'll make you sound completely insufferable or like an asshole but it's really bothering you?	All the #metoo stuff makes me feel like absolute shit even though I’ve never really been sexually abused, nor to my knowledge abused others. I mean it’s good that it’s all coming to light now, but it is destroying my mental health.	The New York Times keeps breaking stories and publishing articles I want to read but I've already read too many this month and don't have a subscription.
What was a dealbreaker for you - either romantic or platonic - that you didn’t realize was a dealbreaker until you were faced with it?	Someone who openly doesn’t like their family. Who doesn’t want to be involved with their family for no apparent reason (there was no abuse or issues within the family) and avoid them or put them down. The person won’t go for Christmas dinner because “they are just blood related and I just happened to be born by them so why I should I try?” attitude. It really shows a lot about character.	A lack of consideration or tact. People who lack empathy, respect, humor, or depth are hard for me to click with. I need people who have similar values or morals.
What misconceptions did you have about women before finding out it wasn't true?	I am an elf who doesn't have visible leg hair nor armpit hair, and thought every other girl was the same way. I also didn't understand the point of deodorant since people have told me that my old gym clothes smell like clean laundry. College was an interesting learning experience, lemme tell you.	I thought that when I grew up and became a woman, my pee would turn blue. All those commercials with the blue liquid on sanitary pads, and only grown women wearing them.
What's your apartment search tip?	Look at the cars in the parking lot, if there crappy the community is crappy, if there Audi’s you can’t afford it. Look for cars that are newer but not the most expensive. These communities mean they are full of working people who care. Gross over generalization, but it always held true.	Check behind cabinets. This sounds weird, but if you can manage to spy into that little crack between the cabinets and the walls, do it. If places have pest problems they will usually spray before showing a place, but they can't get the piles of dead roaches from behind the cabinets. And roaches fucking suuuccccckkkk. Also look at the fuse box if possible and smell under sinks (for musty, moldy, standing water smell).
How does your SO initiate sex? How do you like it?	Reading this thread simply confirms my theory that I have a man's sex drive. When dating guys in the past, sometimes I see him walk by, grab him by the waist or arm, and tell him that we needed to fuck...NOW. Can't walk by me when he just gets out of the shower and is only wearing a towel, because I will pull that thing off and suck him dry. Bending over at any time? I will slap his ass and tell him how good looking he is. I guess part of this is because I'm a bigger, curvy lady who thoroughly enjoys sex and I want my partner to know that he makes me hot (and wet). I want him to know that I find him attractive and enjoy having sex with him.	only one of my girlfriends ever initiated sex. She would start groping me, take off my pants, grab my dick and "drag" me to the bed. Loved it. My girlfriends after that never did initiate. I've always had to be the one to initiate which sucks. I want to feel wanted too.
What is something that you know, due to professional experience, is absolutely not true but that people seem to believe despite having done no research whatsoever?	No matter what your landlord says, your apartment building has probably had bedbugs in it at some point. Possibly even in your apartment. Sleep tight.	That sick food workers stay home until they're no longer contagious. This is what they're *supposed* to do, and many people assume that food workers stick to this rule. The unfortunate truth is, many food handlers have to work even when they're still very sick because they can't afford not to, there's no one else to cover them, or any number of other reasons. I'm not talking the common cold. I'm talking stomach flu. Its honestly one of the most distressing things I found out while working in the food service industry.
What are some tactics you've used for dealing with some of the more subtle forms of workplace sexism?	Quit my job in business to pursue something more radically feminist. I should say eventually quit my job in business and I'm roughly 3/4 of the way to being a midwife.	I work in an IT department. It's primarily male Engineers, I am the only Communication major and the only woman. I am capable of fixing and handling just as many of the problems that come into our office as the men are. However, for some reason my boss only ever asks me to "tidy the office" or "organize a bit" while the men are allowed to continue working on whatever IT related problem they're dealing with. Lately when I've been asked to "tidy up" I just say, "oh you know, I think Jim is free right now" or joke, "It's Andrew's turn to do the dishes!" Slowly but surely it's been starting to work.
would you be freaked out if a guy told you he fell in love after one date?	>would you be freaked out if a guy told you he fell in love after one date? One date with whom?	If they're still together in a year, then he can tell her "I knew I loved you after our first date". If he tells her now, they won't make it to a year.
Ladies who have been in the workforce for 10+ years, what are some of your career-related regrets?	I was 7 years on one place... the same folk.. tasks... no... Soul need changes... Always... for new life.. for positive emotions... even negative emotions leed to positive emotions...	Staying in a job too long because it was familiar. Job hunting is *hard* and at times there were external factors contributing to a small job market (2008 recession). But I put up with way too much shit for too long because I was used to it. Also, don't kid yourself and think that leaving will screw over your employer. They will be fine. They will make it work and you will be quickly forgotten. Don't sacrifice your own career/happiness/wellbeing because you're worried you'll inconvenience them.
What's your latest "Dammit! I'm an adult so I can!" moment?	I'm not working and haven't for a couple of years by choice (and mental illness), I wake up around 12noon and do whatever.	Going to sleep late. I'm married and don't live with my mother but she'll sometimes call me because she sees that I'm on FB past 11pm and scold me for it as if I'm a child. I snapped the last time she did it.
I'll ask the difficult question here. Did Ross cheat on Rachel or it wasn't cheating because they were "on a break!"?	Honesty Rachel is the worst character in that show. She doesn't want him, then wants him, then doesn't want him and then breaks up his wedding before deciding she doesn't know how she feels. I don't blame Ross at all for sleeping with someone else on a break because God knows how she'll feel or if she'll be with someone else the next day.	Not cheating, but sleeping with random person day after is highly frowned upon if you ever want to get back together.
What's the most bro thing a teacher has done for you?	My eighth grade social studies teacher booked this ugly fucking dweeb in the middle of class one day cause he'd seen a bunch of other students do it. The whole class thought it was hilarious. Took me fifteen minutes to put my trapper keeper back together.	When I was set to graduate, I discovered they had changed the requirements and I had a missing credit. It was a simple class I had already taken the advanced one. I went to my teacher to find out how to get that credit. He rolled his eyes and said it would be a waste of my time, He went to the dean and said he would vouch for me that I knew it. They just gave me the class credit so I could graduate.
Men who haven't been in a relationship in a long time, do you feel uncompelled to remedy that?	So i'm a 58 year old guy who hasn't been laid in a couple of years. I am so over the drama women provide that a good wank every day or two beats the physical intimacy of being with a women. I know, it sounds weak. But in reality, I've learned how to give myself better orgasms than any woman could ever provide. I know how my body works and how the pain/pleasure center works. Intimately. So, no. I have no compelling reason to be in a relationship. Also, most of the women my age are unattractive/overweight/too much baggage and are totally unattractive.	I'm 34, and havn't had sex in 6 or 7 years. I'm currently trying to remedy the situation. I have a lot of great friends who want me to succeed, and I've been focusing one my health and goals to be a better person. I've actively been trying to go on dates. But I keep running into the same problems... Women just don't seem to find me attractive. I often feel humiliated by this. I try over and over, and I feel like I'm getting no where. It's a horrible feeling, and I want to stop feeling it. I'm not going to give up, but I always feel like I want to... I feel like a failure as a man and a human being. It's rough, but for whatever reason I keep trying.
It seems like women are shamed for wanting children or not wanting children, by both men and women. Why can't we just be ok with other people's life choices?	How do women shame other women for wanting children? Edit: This is a sincere question. I'm not denying it happens, but am genuinely curious what it looks like when it happens, because my own experience is that our society tends to be very enthusiastic/supportive/celebrating around having children.	Some people feel threatened or judged when other people choose different life paths. It happens for far more than the question of having children. I think it is just a feature of some humans to feel like people making different choices than themselves are automatically judging or disapproving of them, so they reflect that assumed negativity back into the world. Or maybe they have very strict beliefs on what constitutes a "right" life and just can't handle when people make other choices. It's just something that happens with humans in my experience. The focus topic changes but the outlook doesn't.
Lesbians, what experiences have you had with people misunderstanding your sexuality?	When straight women, after learning you're queer, hit on you. It's doubly worse when these women play the long-con, and end up really breaking your heart. I'm a queer, monogamous woman. I'm not simply a real-life sex toy without emotions that a straight woman can play around with until she's bored. Straight women, why do you use us like this? lol	Few things right off the top of my head: * A magic penis will save me from my lesbianism * I'm gay because someone hurt me * I hate men * I hate my dad * My sexuality is fluid/on a scale * That I'm only bi until graduation (I've never identified as bisexual) * My attraction is the same as a male stereotype's (Male gaze) * I'm too pretty to be gay I think people have these misconceptions because female sexuality is seen as servile to male's and anything that outrightly bucks that notion is treated as abnormal.
Bros, what do you think about getting STD tests at the start of every relationship?	Save that conversation for after you've been fucking her with **condoms** for a little while. That way, if she gets pissed off and leaves you, at least you got to bone her a bunch of times, amirite? I mean, having her piss off before you get to nail her *at all* is pretty disappointing.	You're being absolutely reasonable, and I commend you for doing so. There's a reason STD rates have skyrocketed in recent years, and the refusal to take accountability for one's sexual health is why. Any time STD testing threads come up there I'm astounded at how many people never have, or rarely have them. I'm a woman, but if I suggested mutual STD testing and the guy got angry then I'd probably cut and run. It doesn't necessarily mean this person is trying to hide an STD from you, but it means her attitudes towards sexual health are pretty backwards and her logic isn't all there. Those two issues should be seriously considered as deal breakers.
How often do you cry?	once every 2 years, and it's not so much feminine in my eyes. crying or showing *any* emotions at all is a sign of not having your shit together. a crying man is a loser, an overjoyed one an idiot, and if you openly claim to love someone you're weak. being in touch with my emotions means little to me; they're not welcomed by anyone or so it seems. men aren't valued personally, our needs and desires are thought of as silly or dangerous and expressing ourselves makes us a burden for those around. men are supposed to fix shit. Get a house, maintain a family, take care of those around you and be nice doing all of it. we're a kind of employee to life: valued for actions, not looks or personality.	not real often. The birth of my son got a few tears out of me. I do love being a dad. Sometimes a movie will get a little well up but not actual crying.
Ladies, do you ever get frustrated when you get yourself all hot-ified and your SO doesn't even seem to notice?	Sounds like passive-aggression to me. Is he the kind of guy who will "dig in his heels" if he feels pressured or expected to say/do something?	My grandmother used to do this on purpose to my grandfather. He would leave bouquets of flowers somewhere in the house for her to find, or little gifts. (he would just randomly do this) My grandmother would always pretend to not notice them, and my grandfather would get more and more upset until she couldn't hold it in any longer and started giggling. Then she would exagerate finding them, and gush for an hour while he beamed lol.
Women who are on a diet: what food that you're not allowed to eat do you miss/crave the most?	The "diet" I'm on dropped all refined carbs (anything with white flour). Surprisingly I don't crave any of it now. Refined carbs make your body crave more refined carbs. So once you stop eating them you don't crave anymore.	I count calories so I can eat pretty much everything, what I miss is the amount of food I was eating. I want so bad to eat an entire pizza or a whole burrito bowl and I have no idea why. I have not once gorged myself in the last year, but damnit do I think about it all the time.
What made you realize life was not fair?	When I came to the realization that I was so beautiful and sexy while everyone else was just so uggo. Life just ain't fair.	Moving to a poor city and attending public school. The other kids were blown away by things I took for granted.
[serious] any ladies in their twenties out there confused about their goals in life?	I have a very high libido, but I also don't want to get married until later in my twenties. My culture and religion make it impossible for me to just go down that road and do one-night-stand. So now my bigger confusion in life are - Do I need to focus on my career or My need? I want to be independent and strong but I don't want to be associated with anyone personally. I'm still trying to fit into the hectic lifestyle and growing career and still can't date without thinking of marriage.	Oh, absolutely. I have no idea what to do with myself. Do I want to go to college? What kind of job, or career, do I even want? Do I want kids someday? What if I never find 'the one' or get married? My conclusion: Yay, cats!
What do you think about "micro-cheating"?	This whole mess makes me glad my partners are super introverted. They don't go to bars alone, or have any female friends they hang with or really do much of anything without our whole group. Also they don't use social media much. So yeah, just gonna be happy this isn't a concern for me because it sounds tiring.	I don't understand the concept of "micro-cheating". What I do understand is the concept of relationship boundaries. Every relationship partner should have their boundaries and if their partner goes outside of the agreed upon boundaries, then I think that is a betrayal by their partner. Whether or not they want to call that cheating, "micro-cheating", or whatever doesn't matter to me.
Those who've had an abortion, what do you wish you knew beforehand?	Ignore people you think they can make that decision for you. Dont be ashamed, youre not doing anthting wrong. Its ok to be depressed for a few days, but then everything will be ok 🙏🏼	I'm the asker of this question. Thanks to everyone sharing their experiences. I am really struggling emotionally with my decision - logically this is the best decision, and I'm very thankful my partner supports me - but I'm still really scared. Your honest words really help. Thank you.
In the UK it's essential for older men to have a retreat from the family - The Shed. What is the equivalent in your Country?	Isn't this kinda messed up when you think about it. It is generally excepted that men are supposed to have a retreat from family but women women are discouraged?	Here in the US we call it the Man Cave. They are not always a separate structure from the house like a shed (though sometimes they are), but instead they are usually a room of the house dedicated to a specific purpose. For some, it functions like an office, but for others it may be an entertainment center. What is funny is that for my parents it is my mom that has a room like this. My dad is an extrovert so he is fine with doing whatever he needs to in a room with other people, but my mom is an introvert and so has an office that has doors she can close off from the rest of the house.
Ladies of the medical world, what's the most odd thing you have had a patient openly admit to you?	I'm in labor and delivery. A patient called our triage line for contractions and, of course, was asked to come in to be evaluated. She was a prostitute and stated she was going to have to do "at least some anal" to be able to get to the hospital. She was a well known patient, so we knew she was being completely serious. Yes, these our the mothers of our generation ladies!	I'm a psych nurse. I have countless stories. A fairly recent one that sticks out: I walked onto the unit to start my day and a patient approaches me and seductively says, "Good morning. Did you know I was born in a light bulb?" EDIT: spelling
Men, how have you been self-destructive lately?	Was accused of sexual assault thirty years ago. Thought it was no big deal so I decided to get out in front of it and say I didn’t remember but I did some shit when drunk back then. Then thought it would be a good time to come out of the closet to deflect what little heat might come from an unfounded accusation. Wait. That’s Kevin Spacey. Not me. Sorry.	I have a paper due by the end of this week, and I continue to waste my time doing mundane shit like browse reddit, play games, tinker with my fantasy football teams, and watch youtube videos. I just can't seem to focus, and actively avoid doing the things I'm supposed to do, then I feel like shit afterward. I've been working on this paper all semester. And the previous semesters. Actually it's my Master's thesis.
What was the reason you walked out on a first date with someone?	She said “you know what, this date is over. I hope I never see you again.” So I told her “fine, then I’m leaving!” I don’t think she could hear me by that point, but whatever.	I went on a date with a guy once to a park. He ended up throwing a baby swing at me while i was on another swing. He did this because he wanted to get on and i wasn’t getting off fast enough. After i walked away and told him not to contact me, he thought that sending a dick pic would be a great way to say he wanted another date.
Men, what is weighing on your mind today that you'd like to get off your chest?	I fell in love with this girl a few years ago, hard. I've never felt stronger about someone. She didn't feel the same so after a year she broke things off. For a year now I've been using girls that I have no interest in to try and feel the way I did with her. I've ruined a ton of girls lives and i don't know if I'll be able to stop.	I’m sexually deprived, and lonely but I also hate one night stands, or rushing into a relationship. I also dislike prostitution, so that sucks. Besides that shits pretty good.
What is something women complain about men doing that we do as a consequence of what women do?	> do the proper messages the girl doesn't respond What does that even mean? That because you didn't "Hi babe" or something copied that you "deserve" interaction? If you can't handle rejection, don't online date lol	For me it's raising voices. Something will happen, and we'll start heatedly talking, she'll raise her voice to talk over me, which causes me to raise my voice to speak over her.One of us will point out the other is shouting and it'll devolve into bickering over who was shouting over who first.
What are today's taboo subjects we really need to be talking about?	Racism. Even on reddit, on the liberal as hell subs I frequent (r/askwomen, r/trollx, /r/vegan, etc) I noticed that white people just never want to listen to PoC. They never want to admit they are wrong, or that behavior they've participated in is harmful, or anything.	Mental illness is still largely taboo. Attempts to destigmatize it have been baby steps in the right direction. Sex work and people's inhumane views towards sex workers. How unethical the US's prison system is and the widespread apathy/schadenfreude towards the abuses prisoners face. All discussion pertaining to suicide is still too taboo to discuss, whether it's physician assisted suicide or providing some sort or suicide prevention. No one wants to touch this topic.
Have you ever had a crush on a man who was "inappropriately older" than yourself? What was it about him that made you so attracted?	I had a crush on the parent of a child I used to work with a couple of years back. He was around 40 and I was 21. Also when I was 18 I had a short fling wih a 40 year old.	I crush on at least one professor every semester. They're usually in their fifties if not older. I'm attracted to their intelligence and confidence and the command they have over their classes.
What’s a common misconception about sexual assault that really needs to be cleared up?	**Status: Locked. Thank you to those who participated within the rules.** Please remember that this is a sensitive subject and you are likely talking to people who have experienced rape or sexual assault themselves. Do not argue with their personal experiences. Do not derail. Do not attempt to invalidate. All of the rules are in effect and assholery will not be tolerated. **Please Report All Rule-Breaking.**	**Status: Locked.

Guys, what's the biggest dick move you've ever pulled?	Okay so, there was this substitute math teacher and my best friend and I were pretty similar looking. So the thing was this teacher gave the classroom an exercise to do, and the one who could finish it in time would get a 10, my friend did it but not in time, and then, (looks like the teacher kept thinking about how a dick he was to him) at the end of the day, he asked me my name, saying that he was going to put me the then. And well, I gave him my name instead of my friend. Also my friend was close to fail the semester (but at the end he passed)	This guy my sister was dating pissed me off so I covered the hood of his car with maple syrup and bird seed. It was winter so it froze on there pretty good. There was SO much bird shit.
What are some questions you wish you had asked your girlfriend before things became serious?	I'm in the military and I've made the personal decision to not vote in any sort of elections for personal/professional reasons. It came up in conversation because my girlfriend asked me if I had registered to vote yet because I needed to vote for Biden. I was taken aback that she thought she had any right to tell me who to vote for or that Biden was somehow a superior candidate. I tried to explain the situation to her tactfully and she just couldn't seem to understand it. Then I tried logically explaining that having two bad choices with one less worse than the other was not a good reason to vote for the less worse option. Caused a huge fight, recommend you lay your political viewpoints out early because when it comes up it will cause problems if they aren't aligned.	I would ask specifically “are you currently neglecting mental health care and medication recommended by your doctor who has been treating you the previous decade and did you really lose a court case where you stabbed your ex in the chest and ordered to pay restitution and do you still have sex in the bathroom at work with that weird guy Dale you work with”. Honestly would have been a lot easier if I had just asked that up front instead of finding out the hard way.
What's something obviously designed without the input of any women?	Jars. And soda bottles. Can't we really come up with something with more grip to make it easier to open without requiring a boyfriend? Damnit!	Girly versions of things. There are sometimes practical considerations like making things smaller, or easier to reach, or lighter.. but never pinker. And they're so, so often pinker. Pink hammers, pink drills, pink golf clubs, pink sports jerseys (so no one can tell who you support from a distance), I'm pretty sure no one ever asked for these things to be the *only available colour* most of the time.
Those of you who use Tinder, and frequently go to her place to get to the point, how do you go about it?	Pick her up on the second date and do something that's at night time that involves a little bit of drinking. When you drop her off at the end of the night mention that you're tired and ask if she has any coffee or water inside. After that the rest is rather straight forward.	My comment is not about Tinder, or even relationships. If you continue the thought process of "should've achieved this by my age" it will destroy you. I did that to myself for most of my teens and into to my early 20s until I learned not to do that, but by then it had already done a lot of damage to my self worth and self image. Stop comparing yourself to other people, other people will always look better. Everyone progresses differently in life. Just because you're at a different place in life compared someone else at your age doesn't mean it's the wrong place, it's just means it's different. Different isn't bad. EDIT: grammar
What does vagina taste like?	Salty oysters. That's an in shape girl with good hygiene. It's alright, it's a light flavor. It's still not a good taste -- it's discharge, bacteria, and _SNOT_ -- how good did you think it was going to taste!? Far girls or girls with a problem? Worst thing ever!	I was dating this one girl. We were fooling around during the day and I went down on her. Later we went out for Thai food. She ordered an assortment of dishes for both of us to try. I swear she tasted just like the stock in this places Tom Yum Talay. It was just the light broth taste but not fishy. I kept this to myself as I thought it best not to compare her box to fish soup.
Any single ladies here who are not on tinder or on dating sites ? Why not ?	Because I haven't been single in 13 years. A lot of online dating things were in their infancy back then, and even then, a 16 year old didn't need to be on them.	Because I like being single. So many people forget that single isn't a stage where you're looking for a new relationship, it's perfectly possible to enjoy being by yourself without a partner.
Do you text differently with girls you like vs girls you are friends with?	I generally don't text at all. Don't look for "subtle signals" or any sort of bullshit like that. If you like a guy, fucking ask him out or something.	Yes, the difference is that I'll rarely text a girl that im friends with. Compared to someone I'm attracted to, in which case I'll text more often. I hate texting, but if its someone I like, then its worth the effort to me. Can't say this applies to all guys, but I'm sure I'm not alone on this one.
Is it rude to tell Indian co-worker that he smells very bad? He's a cool dude but it's soooo bad! How do I convey it delicately?	What does being Indian have to do with how he smells? I'm not being antagonistic -- I want to know if you're specifically concerned about his reaction because of cultural differences.	You don't. You go to hr and have them do it. It's not your job, and most jobs have grooming standards.
What popular movie conveys a terrible message?	Juno. It's ok for teenage girls to get pregnant because rich couples will want to adopt the child right away. And of course the baby daddy is deeply in love and wants to be with her....that's how it always works /s	The Breakfast Club. The jerk who sexually harasses you and verbally abuses you is not dating material just because he’s being abused at home. He needs to show that he’s capable of long term change before you even begin to consider it. To show an example of the opposite: the original Beauty and the Beast. Belle initially resents the hell out of the Beast. It’s not until he shows kindness, restraint, a willingness to learn, and mercy that she falls for him.
Those who work full time and own a dog, what has your experience been?	I give my guy a big walk in the morning, but otherwise I think he is such a creature of habit he can't wait for me to be gone. I watch him through the blinds (cause I'm a creeper mom) and the *second* he hears that lock click, he turns around and jaunts straight to the couch. He's a Boston Terrier In the summer, we can sleep in (I am a teacher) but I still have to drag his bootie out of bed. Find the right dog and he'll be fine.	It's been fine but you need to be fair to the dog. To me that means a walk or run before work and long walks and play time after work every day, trips to the park, etc. A bored dog can be a destructive dog, especially if it lacks exercise and mental stimulation. I wouldn't get one if you're going to kennel them all day and then at night. No dog should live in a cage for 1/2 it's life for a person's convenience.
Did you grow up as the "really pretty" or "really smart" girl? What was it like?	"really smart" - top of the class without opening a book smart, perfect SAT scores smart, finished two hour exams in twenty minutes smart. It was ok. I've never wanted to be stupid, and I'm also pretty - even if not exceptionally so - so I don't really feel ugly. I *do* wish I'd had to study at some point in my life before the age of 20, because fucking hell, I had no idea how to.	I won't call myself the "really smart" girl in school, but I was the one that was just supposed to *know* everything and have all the answers. If I couldn't figure something out in groups, people would actually get snippy with me despite the fact that they weren't doing any better. It was frustrating.
What is a video you once saw but have never been able to find again?	Not a video but there was this gif of master chief kicking ass with a sign post and shotgun in the style of the matrix but alas i cant find it.	Saddam Hussein’s execution. Was all over the web for a few weeks, then just disappeared. Edit- before anyone says it, yes there is still a video out there, but it’s not the same source, which was much higher quality.
Men who were in a seemingly perfect never ending relationship, what caused it to end?	I’ve never heard of a 20 year old refer to their girlfriend as a partner. You’re not even done with school yet. What do you need a study buddy or someone to split the mortgage with? You don’t need to break up with your girlfriend to be a man but it probably will happen and I only say that because of your age. So don’t go betting everything in being with her forever, wait on kids, marriage, home ownership, etc. Try out an apartment and a houseplant and maybe a shared cable bill. Then you’ve got a partner and you can evaluate her performance from there.	Never stop pursuing her, even after you get married. If she's important to you, make her a priority. Otherwise something will take her place and she will notice. and vice versa. Communication is key.
What was the defining moment that made you realise your S/O was "The One"?	I'm a man but I don't think there is a "one." I think it's completely random who you end up meeting and you may or may not find someone you can spend your life with. And if you do, it may still fail after a period of time. There is no magical right person made specifically to compliment you. Sorry	For me, it was actually the other day. We had gotten into a mini argument a few minutes before, and I wondered out loud if I was worth it for him because I know how stressful my mood swings and irritability can be. As soon as I asked if I was worth it, he started crying. Began telling me that he didn't understand how I could ever think I'm NOT worth it when I'm everything to him, when I make him feel happier and more loved than anyone else ever could. I started crying too, and I couldn't be more sure.
Married women of r/AskWomen: what was your favorite thing you put on your wedding registry?	We received a gift card to Bed, Bath, & Beyond as a wedding gift. Husband told I me to get whatever I wanted. I chose a towel warmer. I'm petite and tend to be cold more often than not. A warm towel after showering when it's cold out (and sometimes even in summer) is heaven!	The kitchenaid stand mixer, by far. It was priced at 499 or something horrendous, but my husband (then fiancé) is a cook, and he *drooled* over that thing, so screw it, we stuck it in there for shits and giggles. And damned if we didn't get one from his aunt who lives across the country. (The first time I ever met her was when she flew in for the wedding) We use that thing coooonstantly.
How do you handle the "what are you looking for?" question when a girl asks it early on?	Never ever ever answer this question in a straight-forward manner. You *always* have to deflect this. Any definitive answer removes the mystery and she'll lose interest. You have to be vague and charming, but not dismissive. The key is to get her hamster running and create/increase the sense of mystery about you. I promise, if you leave it open-ended, she won't run away, but be intrigued. You need to go with this: "What do you want? What are you looking for?" Then you answer some version of "I'm looking for new exciting experiences. And I'm looking for company to experience whatever life has to offer." It's good. Suitably vague, but positive. And doesn't answer "girlfriend/ltr/fwb/wife." If she presses you, "What does that mean?" You answer, "What I just said: somebody to experience life's adventures with." She'll fill in the blanks with whatever she wants.	I'm a monogamy fan so I would always say "I would like to take this seriously, and take it as long as we can." "As of now I don't see this having a defined end, so I want to continue that trajectory". Last time I said that was 10 years ago last night. So far seems the trajectory has maintained it's overall direction.
Do you think porn gives you unrealistic expectations which then leaves you disappointed in bed?	Sometimes. Other times my disappointment comes from a long build up to then really boring sex. I met a girl who really pushed for the long game, I started falling in love with her. I come to find she doesn't moan during sex, doesn't verbally express when she's had an orgasm, doesn't like giving head, and doesn't like doggy style (despite having the ass of a Greek goddess). It really sucks and I don't know how to tell her that I don't think this is going to work out :(	Yes for sure there is no way you can get a plumber same day, that alone keeps me awake at night.
Women who cut toxic parents out of your life, when and how did you do it? What was the last straw? Do you regret it?	I cut my father out of my life when I was 13. He was an alcoholic who cheated on my mother and wasn’t ever really a parent to my brother and I. I sat down with him and my therapist (who I had started seeing once they divorced because I had been self harming). He started off by putting everything on my mom as he always did, always the victim and never recognized his own misdoings. I didn’t look at him and I told him that I did not want any contact with him indefinitely. I’ll be 21 this year and it is the best thing I ever did for myself and my mental health.	My dad was unhappy that my then-boyfriend came to visit me (and stay with me) when I was studying abroad. He threatened to commit violence against my boyfriend and my boyfriends family and ruin his family business. He also threatened to not continue paying for my education if I didn't break up then and there. Guess who's happily married and 100% financially independent now?
Why is flexible sexy?	The sex positions thing is utter bullshit, people just say it reflexively honestly. Think about it...if you were banging a really attractive girl who was flexible, would you even want to fold her into a pretzel? Is that sexy? Of course not. No one actually does positions like that, you barely even see them in porn. You're fucking, not performing a circus act. Flexible women are usually athletes (gymnasts, dancers, ballerinas) which is automatically feminine and sexy. They're in shape and they're good at something that is unique. Athleticism is a big turn on, for me. And I always think ballerina. I have a huge thing for ballerinas.	For me, it just oozes athleticism, which I find highly alluring. I've definitely noticed a correlation between flexibility and fitness.
Men who managed to find and get back "the one who got away", what's your story, how long did it take?	Ok no native english speaker here... 3 weeks... (does it counts?) First of all i wasn't really in loved with her, we were just "good friends" and had a lot of sex, one day i didn't took my phone to job and she called, she went crazy because i "ignored her" and said "i don't want to see you ever again", she blocked me on facebook, whatsapp, etc and i blocked her calls. (I started missing her at this point)... 3 weeks later she tried to add me on facebook again but i didn't accepted, then she called me from another phone crying and saying "listen to me please", afyer a while we agreed to be just friends, she called me home next day and asked me to be her bf, curretly dating her :)	Not sure if this counts... We dated in 2008, for a few months, broke up because of me, I regretted my decision, but we stayed close friends. I chased her for years, bending over backwards for her in an attempt to prove my worth, making it known that I'll always be there. By 2017... I told her I was done, and planned to move one and that wouldn't change our friendship. Within a week of me telling her, she told me she had done some thinking and wanted to be with me. I looked her in the eye, despite thinking this is all I wanted for the better half of a decade, I said no.
South Asian and East Asian men in western countries, how has your dating life been?	Not Asian, but I quite commonly see ugly Asian men dating very cute Asian women. At least here in the States, the Asian women tend to flock to their own ethnicity it seems.	South Asian living in America here. It's been awful. I wasn't allowed to date when I was younger so I guess I'm at the stage now where I still have no idea how to talk to girls... I try but never have success. I had self-esteem issues for a while but I'm fine now. I started lifting more and that helped. It helped my confidence anyway, not with girls lol. In fact, the only people that will compliment you if you start building muscle is other dudes. I will say this though. I swear I'm not trying to sound racist but the number of white women that find me creepy without me interacting with them is insane. Not a problem at all with non-white girls.
Girl here: Standard of sleeping over after sex?	That kind of question pisses me off cause it reminds me that i'm a 22 years old sexually frustrated guy who's wasting his youth and who would like to have sex casually like OP does. Life sucks. Why is it so easy to be a girl?	I think it would be best to sleep over simply to be safe. I'm no native of New York, but any major city in the middle of the night is usually less than ideal to walk about in. From a social stand point, it really varies from guy to guy. And girl to girl really. Ask yourself what works best for you and go from there. If no one is asking you to leave, waiting until morning should be perfectly acceptable. You could even ask before going home with him. Possibly make it a jesting inquisition by asking if you'll be treated to breakfast or whatever approach you think best.
Men of reddit what reflexive moment are you most proud of?	I have always been really empathetic and wish I could find a way to show it, even if it was through the smallest action. I eventually managed to train myself to automatically do small courtesies, such as holding the door open, helping pick up dropped objects, etc., for strangers regardless of their appearance. It seems simple but it took awhile to develop a consistent habit of doing so.	Bending over to tie my shoe when someone on the team decided to kick a ball at my face. Caught it and slammed it down without looking up. Everyone saw, felt like a giant.
Those who have had a Vasectomy: are things any different during orgasm?	I've noticed a difference. Feels about 90 percent of what it used to be. Also have some aching after sexy on one side that eventually fades. Not a fan of the procedure.	Here's the thing. The way a vasectomy works is they snip the tubes that go from your testes to the sac that stores semen. So what happens is there's no more flow of sperm to the seminal vesicle (not sure on the exact wording) which means that your semen is now just salty liquid with nothing in it. It doesn't change the way you orgasm, it doesn't make it feel any different, it doesn't make jizz disappear. All it does is prevent sperm from entering the seminal fluid. **EDIT** Guys I don't have time to explain every little minuscule detail of what happens before and after a vasectomy. Here's the short list * you still have an orgasm * you still get wet dreams * you still release ejaculate * you just don't have any swimmers in it
How do you feel about girls who meow?	I have a friend who meows to songs, sometimes without realizing she does it. Just a random quirk that turns into a series of jokes. No biggie.	Sometimes its okay. It depends on the settling. For example it's okay if: * You are meowing to a cat. * You are wearing cat ears in an appropriate setting. (ie halloween, sex club) * You're talking to Jim Gaffigan. I'm sure there are more, but those are okay in my book.
How do you get yourself out of bed in the mornings?	Here's a little tough love kiddo. Grow the fuck up. If 4 alarms can't wake you up, the problem is not with the alarms.	Keep a water bottle next to your bed. After the first alarm roll over and take 10 sips of water (or 5 large gulps). You are now awake enough to get in the shower. Towel off and realize that your second and third alarms have been ringing while you were showering. Your roommates probably hate you. Sprint into the bedroom and shut them off. You are now awake enough to eat breakfast. Eat breakfast. You are now too awake to go back to bed. Fuck it, might as well get on with the day.
What "trend" do you think gets more shit than it deserves?	Highlighter makeup. I love makeup and I’m a bit nutty about it when I want to doll up my face, but I can not for the life of me figure out highlighter and I figure it’s not for me in the end. With all due respect, I think it’s fine other young women wear it (do what pleases you!) but I come from a time where when I was in High School...no girl wanted a shiny face. Especially not myself. I don’t mean just oily either, because no one wants an oily face, but anything shimmery or shiny for makeup unless it was lip gloss was out of the question. I had friends who were constantly trying new powders and product suggestions just to reduce shine. So the trend of highlighting your face is not for me. For others, sure! Not me.	CHEVRON. I never knew that people hated it until I there was a thread about home decorating trends. It's so cute and I don't get why people hate it so passionately.
Growing up poor, I find dating women in college who had a much better upbringing than me hard, any advice?	We have had similar experiences growing up. Just wait till you hit the white, upper middle class, white woman who is going to tell you about how your penis makes you privileged, and no matter what you say or do she is going to tell you that you had it good. Far better than she ever did, and does now. How you are the oppressor and she is oppressed so she has the right to treat you like shit. Its coming. I've found university almost unbearable, due to similar experiences. Edit: Apparently /u/parannoyedandroid knows you better than you do. Its already begun! No seriously anyone who thinks what /u/parannoyedandroid wrote is some how accurate, they are delusional.	I can relate, though it's not limited to women. Admittedly the men don't tend to cry as often, but the almost childlike mindset seems similar between the sexes. I'm well beyond college age, so I'm not sure exactly what advice to give. Perhaps avoid the women with this mindset and set your sights on somebody with whom you can find a meaningful connection.
How does your profession affect your personality?	I'm a teacher and the son of a teacher. I can't help but correct people. If you've watched How I Met Your Mother, in kind of a Ted Mosby, minus the passion for architecture.	I work in legal, so I tend to be very careful with how I word things. I try to avoid statements of absolutes. Conversely, I tend to pick apart the words of others and try to "lawyer" them in my mind. I generally will recognize what I'm doing and snap out of it, but it's just how I'm wired now.
What are your relationship dealbreakers?	Drugs, smoking, alcoholism. Racist or misogynist. Not an adventurous eater. Incompatible sense of humor. Hates travel. Isn't self sufficient. Is egregiously messy or dirty. Identifies as a gamer. Owns gun(s). Doesn't want a kid and/or is unwilling to go through the processes that are necessary for me to conceive. Dislikes my dog. Excessive body hair / a beard. Edit to add: Little boys who can't handle someone's preferences not including them.	Any type of cheating, argumentative personality, and not being able to communicate. My ex would explode on me if I ever said something was bothering me and I would always be the one saying sorry.
What has been a large source of drama when visiting family?	not visiting my mom often or long enough. we dont live in the city where his and my family lives. so we mostly stay at parents-in-law because they have a house. we sleep there, eat there. and of course the kid has a way better relationship with them than with my family (which i find really really sad!) and everytime we visit them we stay about 2-3 hrs for coffee and cake and thats it. you see, there is a huge difference in my parents and his parents from the social status and thats one of the reasons we dont visit my parents that often. and now that my sister is pregnant my mother will have a favorite grandchild living like next door and my child will probably be left out somehow. i dont know if it will but i can see it coming..	Probably the top one is that I don't call/visit enough, which leads to me being screamed at because I "owe" them more visits and calls. Really makes me want to visit more /s
What career is a deal-breaker when it comes to an SO?	Part time job holders/ can’t hold a job down. Anyone who works in jobs like emissions testing. I’m not about to be supporting a giant child who blames everyone else for their problems and lack of money. (Really bad experience with a SO who was like this) and anything to do with stripping or sex. Those just seem like really nasty jobs, for a guy to have. Although I would be fine with a female who owns a strip club, females tend to have a lot more restraint and respect than the average man	I'm a pilot and I wouldn't date another pilot. Been there, done that, didn't work out. It's hard enough when one person in the relationship is in aviation, let alone both.
So my [29F] girlfriend's doctor refuses to install permanent birth control on her, but has no problem suggesting that I [29M] should get a vasectomy instead. Thoughts?	Oh, for fuck's sake, just get the vasectomy. It's usually way less invasive than any female equivalent and you won't have to look around for 10 years just to find a doctor willing to sterilise a woman.	I think it is absolute bullshit. When my doctor recommended my SO get a vasectomy instead of me getting sterilized, I told her that wouldn't protect me because we're non-monogamous. Her solution? "You should be monogamous." End of discussion. Uhg.
What are the most stupid stereotypes people have about your job?	When I tell people I'm a stay at home mom to a 9 month old. Their immediate assumption is it's not a real job because it's not your typical office, 9-5 job - I'm raising a human, we don't get breaks or even those lovely decompressing rides home from work. This is by far my hardest job I've ever had by far, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.	I work in pathology, and most people assume I spend my day cutting up dead bodies. 99.999999% of what we do is to diagnose/treat living patients. When I cut up a body, it's strictly recreational.
women who decided to get an abortion but your SO wanted to keep it, how did it go?	My advice would to be get the abortion. As the woman and primary person responsible for carrying the child and most likely for the rest of the 18 years, him not respecting your decision is a huuuuuuuge red flag. 9 out of 10 he will turn abusive ( if he isn’t already) with or without the child. Get the abortion and find a better man, don’t put up with abuse, you deserve better.	My abortion failed, he didn't want to put her up for adoption when I had her, now I have a daughter with a horribly abusive man.
Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? How common are compliments about your appearance, fished or otherwise?	> Fellow dudes of AskMen, when was the last time you received a compliment on your appearance that you did not fish for? Not counting girlfriend compliments: Last Thursday, from a business associate. > How common are compliments about your appearance? Much more common than Reddit or AskMen would have you believe.	I get compliments about my hair all the time...... mostly from elderly women, never girls my age (I'm 22). I never fish for compliments, as I'm very self-deprecating.
Has anyone found their tolerance for alcohol has gone down the older they get?	I hate to break it to you, but you've got a problem if you're drinking that much, that often. There's never a reason to drink a full fifth in a single night. And this comes from a regular drinker. I have two or three shots worth of bourbon or rum pretty much every night. To answer your question: I haven't noticed much difference. On the very rare occasion that I have more than normal to drink I don't notice much difference. If anything, my regular drink levels effect me less than when I was younger. I'm serious. Drinking that much is killing you. That's what the hangovers are telling you. Think about this serious and maybe have a talk with someone.	I have, but I'll fight tooth and nail to be in denial about it. At one point, I used to be the last man standing in most drinking events. Now, I'll be lucky to manage about 6 strong beers on a good day and with a good meal in my tummy to sponge it up without going wibbly wobbly. It's fucking cruel how this works - when I'm young and have a higher alcohol tolerance, I need to blow up more cash (cash I don't really have a lot of) to get comfortably numb. But now, when I actually do earn and have enough cash to blow on stuff like this on the odd occasion, it ends up being a damp squib. Life is a cruel mistress. :<
Men who have significantly reduced their time spent gaming, what are your recommended activities or hobbies to do instead of gaming?	Things that you can replace gaming with. 1) Get a job. 2) Join a sports team. 3) Start a band. 4) Develop any hobby that takes you out of your own house. 5) Replace video/computer gaming with face to face board/card gaming with friends. 6) Monetize your gaming--turning your hobby into work by becoming a game journalist, streamer, etc., can kill it pretty quickly if you work at it. 7) Start dating a non-gamer. 8) Become a parent.	Get a job. There's almost no way you can play 12 hours of games a day if you work 40 hours a week.
How do I get past not caring about my wife’s day?	Fake it, my wife has this thing where if she has had a horrible day, she just gets home and blows me. So I am interested till I hear positivity. If it's bad though she will be all "Can I talk to you", and go to bedroom or close bathroom door and start grabbing at my pants while saying "that bitch Tina called off again and somehow is still employed". I was very disappointed in Tina's firing	Maybe you’re just too young son so let an old hand introduce you to this magical skit from Chris Rock who drops knowledge on us about how to deal with “how was your day?”. [How was your day](https://youtu.be/HQaLYD6E9Wk)
What has been your experience with a non-linear career path? Example (Art degree working in Medical field), went from a higher paying job to a lower paying job (Nurse to Starbucks barista), or changed jobs without getting a degree and no experience in the new job?	I left a successful career in web development to pursue biology, specifically conservation biology. I'll get back to you at the end of my masters about whether or not I can actually make a living...	I got a degree in manufacturing / industrial engineering and worked in oil & gas for a few years before I rage quit. I ended up landing a job in semiconductors. I had zero tech experience. I even did one year in electrical engineering my first year of college before I realized I *sucked* at it and transferred out of it. Life is weird.
What's the angriest you've ever been at another Redditor?	To anyone who was upset because you were harassed across multiple subreddits by someone, report that shit to the mods of the subreddit(s) as well as the admins. That shit doesn't fly anywhere, and the more people snitching, the quicker something will get done about it.

In your current/previous relationships, what have you taken for granted?	With my first boyfriend I took how fun he was for granted, he was a blast and always wanted to do stuff. After a few slug-people I found another fun one to date though.	I had a partner for 6 years who never lied to me. He wouldn't even give in to subtle white lies. Honesty in the purest form was incredibly important to him. And since I've had relationships with other human beings who lie, even though it's mostly small insignificant lies, I've realized just how much I took for granted that kind of security and ability to trust spoken words. My most recent ex, as terrible as he was for me, was very receptive to relationship tactics I learned in therapy. Things like sitting him down just to tell him how he's made me feel good lately or specific things he does that make me happy or frustrate me, etc. My current partner is just not into that at all, and I really took for granted having someone who willingly embraced that robotic approach to emotions.
Where were you at the beginning of the decade, and where are you now?	At the beginning of the decade, I was a high school junior and turned 17 about two and a half weeks in. I am now a college graduate, with a BA in political science and currently in the process of applying for grad school online. I still live at home and don't have a job yet, but I'm OK with that. I don't want to spread myself any thinner than I have to at this moment in my life.	I was 10 living in my parent's house without a job Now I'm 20 living in my parent's house without a job
Women who practice abstinence until marriage, how do you deal with your urges?	I reminded myself that i wasn’t an animal and I had control over myself. I can see this is going to need an edit. I am not saying women/men who have sex outside of marriage are animals. I am saying that just because an urge exists, I don’t have to follow it, as an animal would. I have control of myself. I don’t have to blindly follow all urges. That’s all.	I maintain my abstinence by fucking my life over and over again, not exactly pleasurable but it keeps me occupied not to date others.

How do you feel when a guy flirts with your girlfriend/wife in front of you?	Punch him EDIT: I don't but if he doesn't stop and being annoying I will. At least if she's obviously with me but if she's out and about I don't really care.	If he doesn't know she's in a relationship, then it's amusing to me. No harm, no foul. If he knows she's in a relationship, that's disrespectful to me and to my girlfriend.
What's the weirdest "Do all men ...?" question you've asked or been asked?	I, a female here would like to know do all men expect a bj during sex? If that is the expectation why is it shocking if I ask for some oral service?	Do guys get together and watch porn and masturbate alongside each other? to this day I wonder how the fuck I might have given her that impression.
