What's the funniest or most interesting conversation you've ever overheard?	One kid to another kid at the supermarket. "Have you ever eaten chicken feet?!" Heard it the other day as I walked right by them. XD	Overheard my professor and a classmate talking the other day. Professor: Oh you used to be a hooker?? Student: Yeah! When I was a lot skinnier though haha. Professor: That's great! I was a hooker in high school! Turns out they were talking about rugby. Woops.	0
Do you wish you had more hugs in your life?	I'm not a touchy person and I get really awkward when saying bye to people and don't know if I'm supposed to go in for the hug or not. When they're from people I'm close to though, I love them. I was really upset the other day and my boyfriend gave me a huge hug, and it made everything feel that much better.	We had a welsh dude at our work for a while, if you were in a bad mood you got a hug. Like a proper hug. I miss that guy.	0
Women whose SO practices a different religion - how do you celebrate the holidays?	I'm Jewish and he's Catholic, but neither of us are very religious. We light Hanukkah candles and have a Christmas tree (no angels or baby Jesus decorations). When we got together, I was so excited to celebrate a traditional Christmas with a feast on Xmas eve, and then I found out that his family doesn't cook and orders Chinese food instead! Such a disappointment.	the mitigating factor within the premise of the question itself is that if the two people are of different religions yet married (or stayed married) to each other, then they were probably not very religious to begin with, if at all really.	1
When did confidence finally happen for you?	Lost a lot of weight and finally started properly looking after myself. I have a proper haircut now, wear fitting, nice clothing and such things. I can clearly notice that my environment now pays a lot more attention to me.	I am all that like you, but I found out that the mindset is important. I don't have a girlfriend but will having one change my life in anyway towards an absolute betterment? No. Nothing will do that. I've just accepted that I prefer being alone and I'm okay with it. Comparison is no good. The second you start doing that, you see the things that you don't have. After realizing that my confidence has gotten better. Also I'm seeing gainz so that's a plus seeing your hardwork paying off.	1
men of reddit, is sex any different if the girl is significantly taller than the guy?	Never had sex. Height is no barrier to relationship. I'm 5'8" and that is considered tall in Southeast Asia where I run around in.	Doggystyle is a little more difficult because her legs are longer so her hips are higher than yours, so she'll have to sprawl out a little wider for your bodies to align.	0
Women of reddit, what's the strangest thing a man had ever said to you on a date?	I was briefly seeing this guy, and we went on a camping date once. While walking back to our campsite, we came across some random dude camper, and I talked to him about cheddar cheese. My date flipped his shit and yelled at me. He "asked" (in an angry, raised-voice manner) who the guy was, how I know him, and why I was talking to him. I told him I had no idea who the guy was, but that we were just talking about cheese. He insisted that I knew the guy and had slept with him in the past. Definitely the strangest thing that a dude has ever said to me on a date.	As a male reading these it makes me cringe so very hard. I've said some of the dumbest, most inappropriate shit all in the name of making a girl smile. Weird happens, it can be extreme but please remember that some of these guys are face-palming at themselves too. Either way, keep them coming!	1
What are some simple “rules” you and your partner set for a better relationship?	We thank each other for the chores we do instead of being resentful for the ones we “always” do and the other “never” does. Sometimes when I’m sweeping and vacuuming or cleaning the toilet I get all grumbly like “He never does this” and then I remember he always does the laundry and grocery shopping and that helps my grumbles.	To be honest, we haven't needed them because respect has always come naturally. We don't call each other names or insult each other during disagreements, we don't yell, we share the housework.. but none of those things were pre-planned or talked about. There is no one "his" chore or "my" chore. We just do what needs to get done as we come across it. Exceptions being things I can't do because I have no idea how.. like cleaning the outdoor pond.	1
Boss women of reddit, what has been your strangest reaction to your position of power?	Honestly I wish stories like these flooded twitter rather than angry feminists who don’t actually help the problem and discredit real issues by drawing attention to their own victimization.	I've had a male subordinate who was doing poorly tell me he needed a new boss because I was "too like his mom for him to respect." He did not receive a new manager. Nor did he keep his job.	0
Those of you with pets you let sleep in the bed, what happens with them when you have sex?	The dog is puritanical when it comes to sex. If we start when she's on the bed, she looks at us with great disgust and leaves of her own accord. Otherwise we'd just ignore her. She's small and easy to ignore.	... What is sex? Oh, is that the thing I am suppose to do with the other adult that sleeps in my bed? I thought we were bedmates due to lack of empty rooms.	1
What aspects of life from a man's perspective are women most unaware/oblivious to?	The amount of times I've gotten dating advice from girls that amounted to "You just need to wait for the right girl to come to you" makes me think most girls have no idea how dating works for guys. They just project their own experiences on men and assume that they're the same.	How hard we've had to work for literally everything we are and have. Nothing is thrown our way just because we're cute. And as soon as we step out of line, both men and women will swarm to take it all away from us. I'd go so far as 'unaware' doesn't really cut it. It's utterly and completely 'oblivious' that covers it approximately.	1
I can't fathom what it's like to be loved romantically. Could you describe it to me?	Safe. It makes me feel safe. Which is strange for me because I always feel on edge. It makes all of my running thoughts calm and my body relax. At first, it gives me a kind of euphoria, but as it gets comfortable, it starts to fit right, it becomes a safe feeling.	Its security, peace, happiness, and exuberance. To have that mutual honesty and trust and care is the most freeing thing in the world, and I wouldn't give it up for anything. He makes me happy, he's my best friend and my soulmate. I just feel so content. That no matter what happens to me in the course if my life that I'll always be okay. Being selfless with your love for someone else is so satisfying and beautiful. Everyone deserves that slice of heaven. EDIT: Plus there's no judgement and 100% acceptance and for someone to feel so strongly with you with all your flaws is awesome.	1
How are you doing? Any miscellaneous things you want to talk about or need help with?	I'm doing fucking awful. Women are dangerous to your emotional well-being. They should be avoided at all costs. I'm seriously going to give up relationships if this one fails. I just can't fucking stand another break up. I'll dedicate my life to something else than love. I'll be happier for it.	I know reddit is pretty anti-religion, but I'm struggling with mine right now. Hispanic dude raised in a Christian family, but recently I haven't been praying, going to church, or anything really. Times got kinda tough recently, I lost a good job in December and Tuesday I start school for a couple of Cisco certificates so I can enter the IT field instead of driving again. Long story short, I'm 23 but I feel lost. I shouldn't since I'm still relatively young but I feel like I fucked up not going to college and shit.	0
Women of reddit, what are your favourite pet/nicknames to be called while dating?	None. If someone called me babe or honey, I would have to say something. If they didn't stop, I would ghost them.	I told my SO that I didn't like 'babe', so now he calls me 'Captain' or 'Cap'. I kind of love it :)	0
Ending a friendzone relationship with a girl. Do I owe her an explanation?	"This relationship isn't healthy for me. I want more than friendship, and since you don't share those feelings with me, I think it's best if we cut contact. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to move past this. I've already made up my mind, but I feel that you deserve to know why. I wish you well." Be brief, but stern. Don't let her try and convince you to change your mind, either by flirting or shaming. Remember: You don't owe her your friendship, time, and attention similarly to how she doesn't owe you sex for being nice to her.	No such thing as a "friendzone relationship", that's called a friendship. Yes, if you're ending a three year friendship you generally can't just cut off contact without explanation and expect her to accept it. If this is more of an acquaintanceship you could have done a more normal fade, but since you went straight for ignoring messages of course she has questions. IMO you should just explain that you still have feelings for her and think it would be best to try to move on.	1
Ugly/unattractive women: what is your experience being the ugly friend?	Not a woman. Just my little two cents I was the shy kid when i was younger, had a hard time dealing with my stage fright and talking to people I didn't know. However, after getting over my fear of speaking to people I love making people smile, their appearances does not matter to me. I compliment everybody when possible, even something as little as "you have a great smile" can surely brighten up someone's day. I just want everybody to be awesome to each other ):	I don't consider myself unattractive but I have a best friend that's a smoke show. You get left talking to the nice wingman a lot and holding purses.	0
Askmen, what popular movie in your opinion espouses the wrong idea of masculinity?	Star Wars 7 has really struck me at this. I left the movie thinking that almost non of the male characters displayed a real human but always just aspects, really flat parts of what masculinity can be. On the other hand Rey is presented more like a male than a female as if it was impossible to be a strong and powerful character with the capability to change the universe for the better as a real female character. Had the impression that (in the eyes of whoever ruined the franchise) masculinity equals either power or unproductive uselessness, while women could only be either manly to be powerful or useless grieving women like Lea I really did not enjoy that movie it left me very uncomfortable with the taste of some artifical nonsense pressed into something i held dear as a child.	The Wolf of Wall Street. That movie is like some kind of a test. There were guys I know who came out of the theatre wanting to be Belfort, and there were others who went home and suddenly didn't feel so bad about their unexciting jobs and their plain wives. To this this day I'm still torn on it. EDIT: Spelled his name wrong.	0
Is a straight man not wanting to have a threesome with another man being selfish?	If he's uncomfortable having a threesome with another man in it then I think she should accept that. But at the same time, if she's uncomfortable having a threesome with another woman in it then he should also accept that. I don't think it's hypocritical to say "I'm not comfortable having a threesome with someone of the same gender as me, but if you're comfortable doing it with someone as the same gender as you then I'd be interested in that". What's hypocritical would be saying "I won't do it but I expect you to".	Nah, fuck that. A threesome is 2 girls and 1 guy. 2 guys and 1 girl is running a train. Source: Black Phillip.	1
Ladies, what do you donate to?	Nothing, because I know that charities will just use most of the money for themselves and then use maybe about 5% of the money for the actual cause.	I can't give money, so I give my blood. ETA If I ever were to live in the states again and able to donate, I'd give actual GOOD food to pantries. So many heartbreaking stories of kids having to choke down disgusting canned meat products on Thanksgiving. If you wouldn't eat it, be kind and don't make it someone's only choice.	0
Where do you fall on the scale of [Ugly &lt;---&gt; Beautiful], and how do you know?	I'm a ten. I know this because everyone is a ten. Beauty is completely subjective. One person's "2" is always going to be someone else's "7". i know for a fact that I'm a ten for some people out there, so that's the number I go with.	Somewhere deep down I know I'm well above average looks-wise. I know this because of the way society has treated me since puberty. But when I look in the mirror I see Quasimodo.	0
What was your "take this job and shove it" moment?	First job. Wendy's. 7am. Cutting up onions for prep. Mascara all over my face. Told my boss I was taking a break and just got in my car and left. No regrets.	My manager expected me to go in to work the day after my nana died. When I said I wasn't going in, she said ''it wasn't your mum, you need to be here.'' I quit on the spot.	0
How do I teach my daughter to respect herself?	Don't tell her "oh some boys like small butts" or anything like that, whatever you do. Help her find other ways to feel good about herself. Help her find things she's good at and praise her for them. Make a point of that, giving her positive reinforcement for what she does, not how she looks, because girls get too much of one and not enough of the other and it can really fuck with their self-image.	> is targeted towards attracting boys and not what she wants to wear just to feel good. What if successfully attracting boys makes her feel good?	1
How did your parents marriage affect your views on marriage?	At some point around my birth, they randomly fell out of love and Dad began cheating. I don't want to get married. People change, and there is nothing romantic about a legal contract	I learned that I will never go for an arranged marriage, and will instead search for a partner that I truly love and adore myself. I also learned that compromise is key- all arguments between my parents don't end sooner than they should because neither of them will ever admit they can be wrong. Having grown up with a verbally and emotionally abusive mother, I'm so scared to form an emotional attachment to a woman. I grew up with 18 years of being told I was never, ever, ever good enough no matter what I achieved, and that I will always be singled out for what I failed to achieve instead. That I'm nothing more than a distracted idiot who will end up homeless on the streets. :(	0
You've suddenly been granted the ability to make your dog understand one concept. Besides "I love you", what do you want to tell your dog?	Don't be scared. I'm right here when anything scares you and the list of what scares you is quite long but I'm here for you, babe.	When you bark, you sound scary to people who don't know you! I know you're just excited about them, but for real girl, you sound vicious. You might wanna work on that.	1
Who are your favorite influential women & why?	Hillary Clinton. She's been working to improve lives since her twenties and hasn't stopped. I will stan for her until the day I die.	Carrie Fisher. She was a mental health advocate, an incredible outspoken woman, and absolutely earned her place as the face the rebellion with her post- Star Wars work. She had great things to say about the Slave Girl Leia outfit or whatever it's called, and what to tell kids about it - "Tell them that a giant slug captured me and forced me to wear that stupid outfit, and then I killed him because I didn't like it. And then I took it off. Backstage." Ruth Bader Ginsburg - because she is a national treasure. A good quote from her: "I’m sometimes asked when will there be enough [women on the supreme court] And I say ‘When there are nine.’ People are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that."	0
What makes your SO adorable?	My wife is Caribbean and any time she gets excited or emotional her accent gets steadily thicker and thicker as she goes on. When we first met I couldn't understand her, so I would have to interrupt her and say 'English please!' but I started to pick up on it. It was really funny when she noticed this. "Whuh dey tink dey can come in mi yaad!" "Yea, screw them!" "Yea! Wait, you understood that?"	he insists on cuddling me all night and pulls me back into him and kisses me if I have a nightmare	1
What is something about yourself that people often don't believe or ignore when you tell them? How do you deal with this?	that i almost died from my eating disorder a few years ago, or generally that i have one at all~ because i am fat. or you know, the usual things. i am fat and therefore i must sit around stuffing my face full of sugar and junk food all day. hah.	A lot of people do not believe I'm 6 feet tall. At least until I stand up and they're right next to me then I get, "Oh yeah, I guess you're right." I do know my own height, but thanks. This one guy who was shorter than me (5'8"? 5'9"?) kept saying he was taller than me, AS I was making eye contact with his forehead.	0
Those who have ended a close friendship, what's the story behind it? Was it a difficult decision for you?	She came to visit after I had lost a lot of weight due to an eating disorder. She expressed shock, worry, and anger, which I understood. What I didn't understand was the cops showing up at my door later that day for a wellness check. She had lied to them to get them to come out and "scare me straight". Possibly even hoping they would cart me off to a mental hospital. It was so violating.	She got depressed and stopped talking to me. I would always talk to her like normal and invite her to do stuff which she would always say no to. I didn't mind because she was depressed, until I saw she was always talking to her other friends and going out with them all the time when she said she was going to be in bed (who also happen to be people who hate me for a misunderstanding I could never clear up) and I was like "well fuck you then".	0
Men, how do you usually refuse a girl?	I'll try to distance myself from physical contact and conversations will never be more than small talk. Pretty much all girls I've come across seem to take the hint.	I'm not the kind of guy that girls approach when they're attracted to me. One of my old high school friends who had a crush on me (but was in a relationship) told me that I came across as mysterious. I don't really buy it, but then again I don't really see myself the way others see me. I think women just give me signals and wait for me to come talk to them, which I wouldn't do even if I was attracted to them because I have better things to do than worry about dating. Which is kind of funny, because girls are more attractive to me when they make the effort to actually be my friends first.	1
Would you rather change gender every time you sneeze, or not be able to tell the difference between a muffin and a baby?	Change gender. It would make life interesting. Like, idk about you all, but I often sneeze a few times in a row. Plus, I bet if this were a world-wide phenomena, then there'd suddenly become a huge market for products that make people sneeze and I think this would be a hilarious world to live in.	I'd rather change *sex* every time I sneezed. Changing gender would mean I'd still physically be a woman, but I'd feel like a man inside my head.	1
What are some "green flags" to look out for when dating?	ITT: girls you set the bar very low. 99% of the stuff in this thread is just basic human decency and sanity.	* Integrity. They do what they say they're going to do. * Compatible libido level and/or compatible kinks. * Communicaton skills. * Emotional maturity. How do they act during a disagreement? Do they call me names? Do they walk off down the street without saying anything? Can they discuss matters calmly and try to see both sides? * Financial savvy. I didn't expect anyone to be rich, but I did desire to find someone else who lived within their means, didn't spend money they didn't have, etc.	0
What is the most memorable, in a good way random encounter you have had with a stranger who you haven't encountered since then?	I was in a new town (eventually moved here) walking down the street and this guy was running the other direction (like working out) and said he liked my necklace. I smiled and continued my walk towards this business, and as I get there the guy shows back up! All out of breath, he asked me out to coffee or drinks. I had a boyfriend at the time, and he was super respectful about me turning him down. I just thought like, wow, this stuff isn't supposed to happen in real life!	At universal studios years ago. Was dragged by my parents on a tour group filled with old people. I was the only person under 40. Sitting on the tram waiting for the tour to start there were people all dressed up as characters from movies. I was miserable and must of looked it. Frankenstein came up and shook my dads hand, growled at my mom and looked at me. Then he walked away to the hill beside the tram. He came back a few moments later with a tiny bouquet of windflowers. He bowed in front of me and handed it over. I didn't stop grinning for the rest of the day. Frankenstein made my 13 year old heart stutter :)	0
Ladies, did you fall in love with someone you weren't expecting?	Yeah. Met some guy from reddit for a hobby. Married him last month. Redditors: no creepier than regular people you'd meet IRL	Yeah, my bestfriend/FWB. We were/are great friends. But in relationship terms I (and he) did not think we were suited. We've been together 5 years now, and definitely.	1
So I was invited to a party by this girl I’m involved with, but she also invited another man I know she’s talking to. Anyone ever been in a situation like this and if so, what did you guys do?	She's basically keeping you on the back burner in case things don't work out for her with someone else, in this particular case the other guy. She probably does value your friendship, but I'd drop any expectation that y'all will ever be a thing. Start getting out there and seeing other women. When she tries to get possessive tell her that you're single and she needs to back off, or cut her out. If the "party" would just be the four of you I wouldn't bother, unless her friend is cute and single.	Didn't even read past the title. How cucked do you have to be to even consider attending as 1/2 of a dual male attachment to a female's attention prosthesis. But, you will go, because you like it, and you are a cuck. Enjoy	1
Where exactly is the line between having a hard life and just being weak?	I don't think we get to draw the line for anybody else. People fight their own battles; I think they carry their own markers, too. I'm not here to tear apart somebody else's journey. If I can help them, I do. If I can't, I wish them well and go about my life.	When you draw the line, you already took a decision. Fighting daily not to draw the line is the real strength. We all are (mentally) dancing above and below the line. Keep the pace, don't give up and be better than you were yesterday.	1
What are your thoughts on slut shaming?	Slut shaming is just another way to be mad at men who don't want you in my opinion. When I was dating I made it known right away that I don't date whores. There's varying levels of what's normal in terms of promiscuity. A woman in her 30's who's had 20 partners is understandable where as a woman who just turned 21 having 20 partners is a slut. I don't think slug shaming really exists outside of someone Already having a vendetta against a specific woman.	Some people are downright hateful towards women who are promiscuous, or even just women who are perceived to be promiscuous, and I think it's fair to be critical of that. At the same time, it's pretty common to get accused of slut-shaming just for having a preference against dating promiscuous women, even if you don't express any particular hatred for them or shame them. I think this overuse of the word is wrong and it doesn't get talked about as much as it should on the discussions of slut-shaming.	0
What is it about dating/relationships that hasn't already been answered in at least 1000 previous threads would you like to ask in here?	How in the hell are you supposed to find a dominant woman? Every woman I have met was submissive. I want someone who will be my big spoon, figuratively and literally.	What kind of dogfood would make for the most romantic third date dressed in dogsuits to show you're equally committed in sharing her love of dogs?	1
What's something you probably shouldn't find attractive, but do?	Acne scars/ imperfect skin-especially when they're not insecure about it. I don't know, I guess I love the fact that you can have this perfect guy flaunt an imperfection- the majority (not all) of guys I've been into didn't have clear skin and I was just into it.	Men capable and willing to dish out abuse. I had a thing for Christian Bale longer than I should have.	1
What are some "out-of-character" thoughts you have sometimes?	I often think about the fact that being hospitalised would temporarily absolve me of all adult responsibility, and fantasise about ways of achieving this. I used to consider superficial suicide attempts or a psychotic break, now I generally think drug addiction. I wouldn't do any of this. I'll continue to be a hard working little member of society who adheres to her responsibilities and doesn't do anything stupid. But it's a nice escapist thought.	Whether I like it or not, everything I think is in my character. If I don't like something about myself, I must change it.	1
What’s your pre-bed ritual like? How do you “switch off” before bed?	I fall in bed exhausted still wearing clothes and fall asleep telling myself I am just laying down for a second. I wake up at three am needing to pee, bush my teeth, and take off my pants. Then go back to sleep. My routine could be better.	Step 1. Marry a spouse that is actually a child disguised as an adult male. (I suspect many men may be this.) Step 2. Get a full time job. Step 3. Have a child By the time my child’s bedtime comes around it is all I can do to get in her bed and put her to sleep. I fell asleep with her so often that I have learned to put PJ’s on before I put her down.	1
If you think about someone you interact with regularly you don't like, what is the biggest reason you don't like them?	Co-Worker: She has a high-school education, a white trash life, is completely two-faced, runs crying to the manager if I'm "mean" to her, can't do her job, but still criticizes my work, and earns double what I do. I might be a snob, I can admit it, but I should not have to explain myself to such a horrible little person.	Everything revolves around him. I've never once seen him consider anyone else's needs or wants. He's quite literally the most selfish person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting.	0
Men, how does it feel to have your desires and needs ignored?	If it isn't working you say goodbye and find someone more compatible. It's nobody's job to do things they don't want to do. Wouldn't want to be with someone who isn't absolutly thrilled to 'fulfill my desires'.	It's not any different from any other day. Women are people, men are resources. Men who are bad at being resources get attacked/discredited/shamed/belittled. Men who are good at being resources get **tolerated**. For now.	1
How do you feel about girls who have had threesomes in the past, or been otherwise sexually adventurous?	If you're sexually adventurous, then don't get all prudish because you want a serious relationship. Finding that kind of shit out will make anyone think "what's wrong with me that they don't want to explore sex with *me*?!" and that may turn to "those desires just didn't go away, so either I'm so repulsive that she can't have fun sex with me, or she's having fun sex with someone else" and thus kill that relationship. So, if you're sexually adventurous, then find someone else who is sexually adventurous and have lots of babies in a very freaky way. (Or don't have babies and just have freaky sex.)	I'm a woman but I've had this same conversation with my boyfriend and with several male friends and not one of them said that it made any difference to them whatsoever. Sounds like the same kind of guy who would say that if a woman has been with X number of guys she's no longer "girlfriend material". Very immature and insecure.	1
Have your siblings ever shared something with you that you really did not need or want to know?	My gay brother gave me WAY too much information about his relationship problems. I'm cool with the fact you're gay but don't ram it down my throat. Ahem.	Oh yes. My 25 year old brother tells me he wanks in the shower which is why he takes so long. My 26 year old brother announced at the Christmas dinner table that his fiancée has a large vagina.(He actually said it's like playing to an empty auditorium) My SIL told me and my Fiancé that she'd been fucked too hard and now she itches. Like, why do I/we need to know any of this?	0
Tips for women being on top?	A lot of women just bounce straight up and down. Getting some horizontal movement in there really helps, and kissing and doing mouth stuff while you're on top makes it so much more intense.	These guys are saying more grind and horizontal stuff. Well that dosent hit all my buttons. Bouncing up/down, kissing, eye contact, scratching, biting, punching (like down on the chest and not too hard just sexy hard), hair whip (just like one whip every five minutes. hand placement, different bounce intensity, changing positions using the other hole, ball fondling, licking (you may want to talk about that first, and best of all being vocal. Say some freaky shit. EDIT: y'all are so nitpicky.	1
Men of reddit, is it universally known that when first dating someone, exclusivity is not common?	there is no universal standard. common dating practices are often regional. in some places, people are expected to *only* date exclusively. in others, exclusivity is only expected after a relationship becomes "serious." where sex falls in that also varies a lot.	Yes, not exclusive until discussed. My GF of 5 years thought we were exclusive from date #1....nope. I saw other women for the first several months.	1
What sacrifices were you willing to make for an ex in order to make a future work, but now that they're an ex you're glad you no longer have to make those sacrifices?	My ex husband came from a very family-first culture and we made a lot of financial sacrifices paying for shit for the extended family. I dont mind doing what i have already done and no regrets, but i am glad my current boyfriend comes from a family where people pay for their own shit.	Keeping my mouth shut because anything other than immediate agreement made him angry. Okay, may be I wasn't so happy about it. But I was doing it.	1
Ladies who love to be alone: how did you get used to living with your SO?	Being an introvert means that other people wear me out. But the closer I became to my husband the less he was “other people” and the more he felt like an extension of myself. By the time we were living together, spending time with him around became a perfectly acceptable form of “alone time.” There’s time we spend together, and there’s time we spend in the same house.	we slept in the same bed together for our first semester as a couple. i learned to not mind his presence, or at least not "interpret" it the same way as the presence of others. i hope that makes sense.	1
If you could talk to one person who is no longer in your life, who would you pick? What would you tell/ask them?	My late aunt. She passed a few years ago suddenly due to cancer. She was healthy and then within months was gone. I'd just thank her for showing me how to make baked ziti as a teen. I make it a few times a year and it's always a hit. But more importantly, it always reminds me of her, and I'm glad I'm able to share it with my family.	To my ex: My phone is auto-correcting what I want to say to you, so I'll stop fighting it. Duck you.	1
Women (and men) of AW, have you ever been stalked on Reddit?	Yep, I've had people go through my history and downvote pages of comments. I actually don't read my PMs at all, because soon after I joined Reddit it became obvious that users saw them as a way to harass me. (I get targeted primarily because I openly identify myself as both a healthy-living fat person and as a health-studies researcher, and I often intervene in Reddit discussions that disseminate false information about fat people, lifestyles, and health. The anti-fat trolls on Reddit are *really* dedicated to shouting down any negation of their "fat is unhealthy" and "calories in, calories out" myths by actual science.)	I had posted a pic of a new tattoo on Reddit once. A user made a comment, and some other user said "here you go" and had found and posted my cell number.	0
Girls, women, ladies; what does sexual attraction feel like?	It's a *want* to touch and to feel them. You're semi-listening to the conversation around you, but you're mind is focused on staring at them and wanting to get close. Intrusive sexual thoughts mingle with the rational part of you. It's both annoying and exciting.	Find it difficult to answer that one as I have a pretty low sex drive myself. Top commenter did it well. But I have a question - as an asexual person, what's the deal? Do you just, like, not have sex?	1
Going to be having a girl over for the first time in nearly a year. Any prep tips?	Tidy the place, fresh bed sheets, baby wipes in the bathroom, cut and file your finger nails and get some snacks/drinks. Just relax and enjoy yourselves.	Vacuum your floor. People walking around barefoot will feel every crumb and peice of plastic on the floor. Oh, and tampons too.	1
Ever find out one of your best friends may be a wife beater? How did you handle it?	God no. What kind of person thinks it's normal for people to break dishes or flip over furniture or *wrestle* when they have an argument?	I stayed the fuck out of it, and so should you. You'll never know the truth, and that's what the law is for. If he keeps trying to argue you onto his side, say "Dude, I always thought the way you guys fought was unhealthy and childish. I have no idea if you beat her up or not, and I'll never know for sure. My advice is to get out of the relationship, take a long, hard look at how you allowed such an unhealthy relationship dynamic to develop, and don't do that again in the future."	1
I misunderstood a girl and thought she wanted to have sex with me so I did. Later I found out she wanted something else but was turned on by my spontaneity. How do you feel about spontaneous sex with a friend? What are some examples where this has happened to you?	Any time I've had sex with a friend, it wasn't like *discussed* before hand. Usually there's just a vibe and someone makes a move.	Anyone else feel like OP is bragging? I mean, congrats OP, but I don't understand the question here. Is spontaneous sex awesome? YES	1
Women who haven't been in a relationship in a long time, do you feel uncompelled to remedy that?	Pretty much, yeah. Singleness is a comfy enough default for me, so I don't see it as something that needs to be remedied.	I've more or less defaulted to it. I've gained weight, hit 30, and am therefore finding ways to be content with being forever alone.	1
How do you compliment girls when you have a girlfriend?	If you’re girlfriend is so controlling / insecure that you can’t compliment another woman, I’d be concerned. You can’t go through this life and pretend other women don’t exist.	If its something you would compliment your mom or grandma on then do that, and word it exactly like you would if you were talking to them. Make sure people see you complimenting others and not women more than men and definitely not specific women over others. I guess you could tell your gf what you are trying to do, as something interesting to share and like a heads up not in a "is it okay if i.." permission seeking way. Good on you for trying to spread the happy feels.	0
Do you think "life skills" should be taught in schools? If so what should that include?	Absolutely. I think personal finance would probably be the most beneficial; it is appalling how many of my friends have no idea how to manage their money.	I think bringing social etiquette would be a great idea. Proper table manners, how to introduce someone and be introduced, how to make polite conversation, how to make your interest formally known, and how to politely decline someone's formally expressed interest. I think these skills have been lost and, while I'm not looking to return society to some kind of Victorian ideal, you can see a common theme on Reddit where people basically don't know how to act in these specific ways, and they end up being socially awkward and clueless how to fix it. People used to literally take classes for these things! Maybe bringing it back in a certain extent would be a non-terrible idea.	1
What is something your SO does or wears that instantly turns you off?	My ex used to do frequent waxing on her legs and pubic region. It was absolutely disgusting. The hair never grew back correctly, it was always sparse and had a weird texture. Waxing is now a dealbreaker for me. Also too much makeup is gross. It doesn't smell good, it looks slimy, it catches sweat and has a weird texture.	She talks in this fucking fake anime voice whenever we're not in public. She does it constantly at home and it's ok for a while but it starts to really aggregate me. I get it's all "cute" and whatever but after a long day at work i want to unwind without having a conversation in high pitched sailor moon squeals	0
Is it right to monitor your child's full online history?	It's not only right, it's your *responsibility* to monitor your child's online activities. When they get around 14 or so, you can talk about *some* privacy (like with personal messages). You also need to have safeguards on any computer your kids are using, and you need to have occasional talks about being online and what is acceptable, and what is unacceptable. Then, you need to actually follow through and check up on them once in a while. If you just sit your kid down in front of a computer and let them do and see whatever they want, you're gonna have a bad time. The most important thing is to stay connected ... to your own kid. Talk to them, *listen* to them, actually *be* a parent, not a baby-sitter.	I don't know if it's "right" but I do know that I have some major psychological issues around trust as a result of my parents reading my chat logs, internet histories, and journals when I was in the 10-15 age range. I'm sure that there are times when that kind of breech of trust is justified, but in my case, I was smart and never got myself into any trouble that would justify them snooping like that - so the only result was that I got very angry with them and had trouble trusting them thereafter.	0
Women who have done sex work, what specifically did you do and why did you do it?	I was a phone sex operator for a month. I did it because I was unemployed and needed the money. The income sucked though, I think I earned like $800 that month, working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. I hated the job, and to be honest, it turned me into a misandrist and someone with a permanent chip on their shoulder, something I’m still working to get past.	I’ve sold videos of myself, been a cam girl, and been a sugar baby. I did it/do it because I can make a ridiculous amount of money. I’ve never had any negative experiences.	1
Has anyone encountered more misogyny from women?	Not personally, no. It greatly depends on perceptions and worldviews and family beliefs and stuff, though, I'm sure, as a few people have called my family dynamic 'sexist,' from Mom, Dad, and siblings alike	I feel as though it's common for people to feel the need to keep members of their own gender "in check." As such I've noticed that a lot of women say sexist shit to other women, and a lot of men say sexist shit to other men. I'm not a fan of it and I try not to feed into it though.	0
Women who regret having children, why?	I don’t regret having kids but I do dream about that elusive world wherein I had my current resources and wasn’t tied down by motherly duties. I have a great career and I make good money, but my husband an I live in another country than our family which implies that we don’t have much support if we ever want to take a break. Yeah we can hire a babysitter every now and then for a date night but the thought of even taking a weekend trip together is laughable. We are so prudent about our vacation days as kids fall sick or school holidays etc and we often have to save time off for such exigencies. I haven’t ever spent a night without my kids and even the thought of it exhausts me.	My 6 year old just yelled down the stairs at us that his older brother (9) is being mean because he's not letting him snore. My eyes met my husband's and I read him the question, he thought y'all should know. I always wanted kids, I couldn't wait to have my own babies. I love my kids and go the extra mile for them. My eldest has been on probation. I'm raising my crazy sister's teen daughter in addition to my 5 biological kids. Boys eat and break things. Girls hibernate and have attitude. Sometimes, I threaten them with abortion. /s kind of.	1
Whats something men shy away from due to gender norms that you find absurd and impractical?	Skincare. Especially when it comes to dry skin. That shit is uncomfortable, and no one is going to take your man card away for moisturizing.	* In general, just liking stuff and being excited about it if it's not sports or killing something. * Pegging * Drinking "girly" drinks - we've even gendered our alcohol! You don't need to suffer through scotch if you don't like drinking peat, it's okay, have a daiquiri. * Wearing clothes to please themselves, or really engaging with fashion as fun. * Crying. * Asking for help, or getting the help/treatment they need. * Being the dude that stops perpetuating toxic masculinity. * Standing up against misogyny. * Talking about periods. Gender roles are the fucking worst.	1
Have you had an ex move on really quickly after your break up? How did it make you feel?	did not care. by the time i break up with them i'm long over them. also, him moving on didn't stop him from staying in my inbox with the drunk texts. poor that.	Sure. Made me feel like he never really gave a damn in the first place. Which I guess was kind of the case, since he'd been sleeping with her for the entirety of our relationship.	0
What's something you're ashamed to admit is attractive?	I mean, not ashamed, but I'm hugely attracted to girls with tired eyes, like those permanent dark circles or slight bags that never go away. I honestly don't know what it is, but it is so damn attractive to me. Maybe it just gives the illusion of more depth...	I like so many things. But very often when I say I like legs, boobs, butts, ears, hair, etc, I don't mean sexually. I really can appreciate a beautifull leg or butt without get aroused or think on sex. And I fell sad that I can't tell a women with a beautiful leg or butt that she has a awsome leg/butt, because sure she will call me pervert. Hard to appreciate beauty on women now a days.	1
On the flip side: What do you guys like to see in a woman's dating profile?	I actually kinda like it if she's a mother. There's something very vulnerable and nurturing about a woman caring for a child. It doesn't exactly eliminate "crazy" from the list of possibilities but it makes me feel like she's more grounded. Gives me that wholesome vibe.	*Message hooks.* If I'm going to spend the time to actually read your profile before sending you a message, you have to give me something to message you about. They could be anything. A funny anecdote. A cheesy joke. A charming detail. But whatever they are, a good profile has these interesting little tidbits that provide the subject matter for someone who is messaging you.	0
Men who have driven fire trucks, how cool was that?	I drive one in the city, it's about as cool as you would think it is. By the way guys, unless you want to look like a huge puss, don't be the grown man with his fingers in his ears when a fire truck goes by. Edit: I should add, I use to drive a really huge truck, [now I drive the fire SUV.](https://youtu.be/kSiwoKCiy-s)	I drive one all the time. It depends on the truck. Our engine has an Allison automatic in it. It goes ok. Our tanker has 8LL in it. It's fuckin fun, lights going, slamming gears, lanyard style air horns with chromed bells. Most guys can run the automatic, but not many can slam gears, run the siren, air horns and radio while smiling. I grin every time I start it.	0
How do I stop viewing sex as something that has to be earned by men?	Outside of what mass media and social media likes to espouse as what "should" be, you are experiencing what "is". In short and in general (there are of course exceptions) , women do not make the first move and women want to be courted. This why you feel you have to "earn" it and frankly you should try to earn it. Why would you want to be with someone to didn't make you earn it just a bit?	So I was talking to my partner about this, and it's something we even struggle in within our relationship. Even when they want to instigate sex they struggle to do so, this is a thing that is conditioned on both sides. I do think that there needs to be a re-framing of what's actually going on though. When women have sex the stakes are a little higher, so there is a larger amount of trust needed to be put into the person they are having sex with. You aren't earning sex, you're earning trust.	0
What has been your worst fuckboy experience?	I have straight up stories about fuck boys, I could go on for days. I experienced this one fuck boy who had this crazy girlfriend. Like she was insane. She found out about me and started stalking me on multiple phone numbers and accounts. I was in Europe studying abroad and shed blow up my phone. She sent her brothers to come to my house and beat me up. After much interrogation her brother admitted it to me and started crying about how the both of them bully him to do things he doesn’t want to do. The fuck boy became obsessed with me and wouldn’t stop calling me long after we banged. Even when he was in jail he called me. I blocked him cuz I saw on the snap chat map at 4 am that he was driving to my house	We sat down at a restaurant on our first date and he told the waitress “She’ll have a double vodka tonic, and I’ll have a water.”	0
Do you ever crave sex with another woman, even though you still deeply love your SO?	As a female I really don't think you needing to "spread your seed" is an asshole feeling. It's what our species relies on. If my SO didn't think about having sex with other women I would honestly be worried. I would rather he spoke to me about it but if it was just sex then I would probably be okay with it. Also sex doesn't = love, it's just a part of it.	Wanting to do something never makes you an asshole. What you do is what defines you, not what you think. I personally want to brutally murder most people I see on a day to day basis but I don't, that doesn't make me a sociopath. You're fine, just don't cheat on her and you're doing the right thing.	0
What are some things you do for your health and personal care that maybe not all men do or know about that you’d swear by?	I got to a chiropractor every six weeks and get worked over, keeps my back and neck in line. I also feel wonderfully sore. I also try to get a manicure and pedicure one a month, I spend my entire work day on my feet and my hands take a beating daily since I’m a chef.	Lately I've been abstaining more from social media to the point that I barely use it anymore. It's done wonders for my productivity and has helped my stress and anxiety to go down. Also stretching does wonders	0
Guys that have gotten divorced, what surprised you most about the process itself, and the change in your life after is was done?	>I was also absolutely floored by the venom my ex had to get out before she could let go. It went on for years. Ugh, my mother did that after she and my father got divorced. There is an African saying "When the elephants fight the grass gets trampled". People, if you care about your kids, don't trash your ex in front of your kids. S/he may be YOUR ex, but s/he is YOUR CHILD'S parent. Trashing an ex in front of your kid messes them up emotionally and makes them resent you. Lose/Lose	So sorry to hear all the trouble everyones gone through - what made you think in the first place to get married / love such a person? Weren't the signs visible early on? Even before getting married? Or did their awkward/selfish traits developed overtime?	1
Girls, how much detail do you tell your girl friends about the guy after you've had sex with them?	This thread is terrifying. There are at least 2 people involved in sex. I feel like the other person should at least be consulted before private information about them is shared. They chose to share that part of themselves with you, not with your whole network.	I usually don't give details except to remark on the quality of the sex and my satisfaction with it. If something mindblowingly spectacular happened, I might be more graphic, but otherwise... not really. Also, I'm far more likely to tell detailed stories about my sexual experiences after they've ended, but even then, I might leave out specifics. "I once had sex with this guy that did [blank]..." I don't know. I rarely volunteer information just because, but a lot of my friends like to prod me for stories and advice, so I guess I share a lot more often than most other people in this thread are saying.	0
Have you ever had a friend develop extremist views? How did you handle it?	Yeah, I’ve had a few go SJW and a few go in the other direction. Not a fan of either camp, but the former especially can’t seem to have normal interactions without making it into some sort of exercise in politics. We don’t speak much anymore beyond a social media “Happy Birthday.”	I'm not sure if this counts because it isn't what we all generally think of as extremist buuut... One of my close friends from college has gotten *extremely* into astrology and the like. I don't give a shit what you believe for the most part but she cannot think outside the context of what planets are aligned or whatever, and it's gotten so bad that I cannot handle more than a 5 minute conversation with her. I feel bad because she's a good person but it's like her personality is now in this little box!	0
Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who recently came out of a relationship, or who quit their previous relationship to be with you? How did it go?	I have dated several men while they were going through divorces (wow, weird, maybe I have a type). It was fine. I have a tendency to overlap relationships, anyway (I haven't been partnerless since 1997, so...yeah) and I don't think it's necessary to have a specific amount of time to be single (and, to be honest, I tend to date men who fall the fuck apart if they are single).	I'd been treated like dirt by the last couple of blokes I'd been out with, and late night messaged my friend to vent about how miserable I was. Co-incidentally he had just broken up with his girlfriend the night before. We more or less decided to pity fuck each other. He was very upfront about not wanting a relationship, and I felt so broken and discarded that I just let it be a casual thing, because I honestly had no strength. However the sex was life changing, so we just kept at it. I remember one day months later he just grabbed me and kissed me and said 'I can keep my hands off you', and I knew something had shifted. It's been two-ish years now, and we have a house and an amazing future together.	0
How often do you wash your hair?	Day One: Clean Hair Day Two: Dry Shampoo (worn down) Day Three: Dry Shampoo (worn up in bun) Day Four: Shower or super dirty bun Day Five: plz shower	Every 2-3 days. I have long and thick hair so it's a hassle to wash everyday. It starts feeling gross like there's something crawling on my head if I leave it unwashed longer than that.	1
Lesbians of AskWomen, how can you tell when another person is lesbian too?	I have a 100% track record for calling it (in my head) before someone explicitly tells me that they're queer. With other lesbians I think it's usually something in the posture and gait, plus the set of the jaw and head. Lesbians tend to stand more confidently than straight women, and you can see it if you're looking for it. Having noticed it a few times, it's now the biggest 'tell' for me. However, it fails me sometimes with very feminine girls, and girls who are queer but not gay. With bisexual girls especially, I'll go back and forth in my head debating if they are queer or not. Basically everyone I've not been able to tell with has identified as bi, pan or queer.	Honestly, there really isn't a clear way without them literally telling you. The fashion that used to be stereotypically lesbian is now much more common outside of the lesbian community, and more and more women are experimenting with the androgynous look. Even if they're wearing some sort of Pride accessory, it's impossible to know what part of the rainbow they are proud of.	0
What is something you never have and never will tell your past or present SO?	A was having sex with a girl and a very large spider popped out from behind her head. I smooshed it with my hand and kept going. She had a spider phobia and would tremble at just seeing a photo of one. She will never know.	Honestly, if she was a vegetarian for very long prior to eating that lasagna she would have gotten quite sick from eating that meat.	1
My friend told me I was asshole for ending the date with a woman because I didn’t met her requirements to have sexual relationship with her, How do I persuaded my friend that what I did was right for me ?	Dude if those are the requirements just to fuck her you dodged a huge bullet there... And your friend is an idiot.	Yes, you were an asshole. But that's a good thing. Your choices were to be a doormat or an asshole. People like doormats. You can walk all over them, wipe dogshit off your shoes on them, it's great. That doesn't mean you want to be a doormat.	1
What's the nicest thing a woman you weren't dating/related to has ever told you?	It's sexual but... She was on top and I said "you know I can keep going for a lot longer right?" and she replied "I know that's why I love fucking you". I was just like yeeeeeaaaaaaaaa booooiiiiiiiii Or there was the time a girl I dated said you are a really genuine person so that's why we have to break up, because you deserve better than me. I'm like "yay?... Awwww shit."	I've had women compliment me on how genuine I am. I think I'm really just too introverted to be capable of being anything other than who I am, still a nice compliment though.	0
How to walk the fine line between waiting for sex until you're sure he's not playing you and avoiding alienating a guy who's genuinely interested?	If he's worthwhile and truly interested then he will be happy to wait until you are 100% comfortable, end of story. Another question might be, are you looking for a relationship with someone who will date other women and be a charming player type with them too?	I'll come at this from another angle: I've never known a man to tell me that he met an amazing, beautiful, considerate, sensible woman with a great personality and upstanding character - and they only stuck around to stick it in. My advice: focus on being the best you can be and providing the relationship the best you can offer. The rest will pan out however it was going to anyway. Plenty of guys sleep with women and then bail when they can't stand their character anymore. Be the chick that a guy wants to sleep with and then stick with afterwards because they're just so damn great.	0
Inspired by the “swipe left” AskMen post - Why are women more accepting of overweight men than the reverse?	Because women aren’t as fickle as some men can be. Yeh looks are important, but honestly personality is more important to me. I’ve dated some average and even below average dudes based on what seemed like a good personality.	Popular media plays a role (as others have mentioned). Just think about all the tv shows where there's a heavier set hubby with an amazingly attractive and/or fit/slim woman. Family Guy, The Simpsons, The Sopranos, Fresh Prince, King of Queens, etc. Even Cersei Lannister and Robert Baratheon for crying out loud. Edit to add: how much you want to bet most of the dudes who said "fat" was a dealbreaker are, indeed, fat themselves?	0
Do any of you go through times where it feels like every girl wants you then times where it feels like no girll wants you?	Sure. Women put it on a platter for me now that I'm married. When I was single, much less so.	Not *every* girl, but there are times when I feel like I'm actually getting attention from women, and times when I'm just like an object in the background to them. Weirdly enough, the amount of attention I get seems to be inversely proportionate to the level of motivation and direction that I have in life.	0
Have you ever had a woman be way too into you and it was uncomfortable? How did that work out?	There was a fat girl named Brianna in my high school Public Speaking class who flirted and played around with me. She was 14 while I was 17 at the time. One awkward moment came as I was doing my work and we sat next to each other. She crouched on the floor and looked up at me, saying "I can see up your nose!" That moment weirded me out. She also at one point asked me out to the prom, but I wasn't into her.	Sure, I think everyone has at one point or another. I broke up with someone after only a few months because I was being suffocated, she said 'I love you' after only knowing me for a few days, I would get the infamous '???' passive aggressive texts if I didn't respond fast enough, all that stupid shit. For weeks after we split I still got anxiety whenever my phone would go off.	0
Men, how do I (F) know when I should give someone my number without them asking for it?	Twisted standards here. So it's out of place for a guy to do this kind of stuff to a girl while she's working but not vice versa? WTF	Can you read minds? - Yes: Then read them. - No: Just go with your intuition. Write the number on the cup or whatever. This is the crux in all human interaction. We can't read minds. You need to risk something.	0
What class have you taken (high school or college) that you thought you would hate but ended up loving?	I took calculus my senior year of high school and expected to hate it, but it was one of the most fun classes I've ever taken. Our teacher was brilliant but batshit insane (in the best way) , the class was full of all my friends, and calculus was like solving puzzles. I loved it.	I was briefly salty about having to take a year of Latin when I was 13 (no, this was not a religious school). I **friggin** loved it. Continued all through High School. Took AP Latin. Went to college, studied Latin all through college. First job was a Latin tutor in college. It was my minor. Still love it!	1
What's the most underrated city you've visited?	Prague, that place is wonderful. Great food, great beer, great people, great sights and it was cheap as heck too.	Detroit downtown has lots of great bars, a wonderful nightlife, tons of boutique shops, and a hockey stadium. But we like to think of it as worse than Baghdad. So I guess that's underrated?	0
What was your worst experience meeting your girlfriend's family?	Her family made Chinese food in an attempt to help me feel at home when I had dinner with them the first time. It was a really sweet gesture, but it was rather misguided. Apparently I was the first Asian guy their daughter had ever brought home, so they didn't know how to host me. I actually find the experience really amusing; my girlfriend at the time was mortified.	One of my exes and were both bisexual and her parents were thrilled because there are some horror stories about some types of straight men. Well, she had a psychotic younger sister who wasn't pretty and it's obvious. Well, she was "going to expose his secret gay affair". She'd make a point to have one or more with these rude gay guys with her. One day, I just said, "those nonsense theories won't help you blame my existence for you being single. If your own men don't want you, don't be blaming us." BOOM. I would catch her scurry past a few times. She's brought up bi men in situations with friends. "The 'official story' is that women don't want them but it's a sham! You've gotta be a lesbo for them to think you are hot too."	1
Ladies in the military, what should I know (what did you wish you knew) before signing up?	You should know exactly WHO you're fighting for and exactly WHAT you're fighting for. Basically the elites violent and insatiable lust for natural resources. Many innocent people are being murdered every day to satisfy this evil greed. As long as you know this reality.	While everyone here has given great advice as what it is like when you're in, know that the joining process is important, too. I'm leaving for Air Force basic training at the end of this month. It took me over a year to enlist, the other branches are much quicker. The recruiter may not openly lie to you, but mine tried to bully me into going open contract. I stood firm and landed a job that I really wanted. Go in knowing that the recruiters are there to make numbers, not to look out for your best interest. Some of them are actually good people but it's not worth the risk. Do your research. Google your questions. Gather your knowledge and make an educated decision.	0
What's the worst decision you ever made that, despite all odds, turned out wonderfully?	Turned up for a job interview in a tracksuit. It was for a job as a sports teacher, so I thought it would be appropriate... until I saw that every single one of the other 12 applicants were wearing a full suit. Well, I must've done something right, because they offered me the job on the spot! When I later asked about the interview, they said I seemed to be much more laid back than the other applicants and thought I'd fit well into the department.	While this is a very very bad thing to do, I am frequently skeptical about "doctor's orders", and it usually works. My doctor would tell me not to touch my sprained foot, I would pull it so hard that something cracks and I'm mobile again. My doctor would tell me to not touch my ear during the infection, I manage to "clear the path" for medication to enter my ear by touching all around it.	1

So husbands, I’ve been thinking a lot about marriage lately, and I’m curious; How did you know she was the one? And how long did it take you to figure it out?	She's not the one. There's no such thing. She's one of millions of women I could be happy and settled with. Sometimes the truth isn't romantic.	We went through several family shakeups and travel nightmares without breaking a sweat. No relationship is perfect, but when shit goes down, she doesn’t fuck around.	0
Why does my boyfriend have such a hard time giving me compliments, but so easily give me criticism?	Because somtimes criticism needs to be said, compliments however don't strictly need to be said at all. Thats how a callous, unfeeling asshole would view it. You're going out with one.	I just got back from my office christmas party, so I'm inebriated. Why does he have a hard time giving compliments? Because He's a fucking asshole. Dump this asshole. I'm drunk.	0
Do you ever worry that a sex tape or nude photos will come back to haunt you?	Yes. I just found out my ex sent pictures of me to at least one of our mutual friends. It's degrading and embarrassing. I never wanted the friend to see me like that. My ex won't even apologize :(	If you worry about that, then a LPT is not make nude photos. There isn't even a point to taking them.	1
What's a common opinion expressed by your male friends that makes you sad/frustrated?	"It doesn't matter to me what my girl decides to be as long as she's happy and not a sex worker." I get that they don't care if she's a doctor or lawyer but people take pride in their profession so it sucks that they could care less.	Whenever a female teacher is caught with a student, it's high-fives all around. They never stop to ask themselves if the student was even consenting (although still a minor). It's like it never crosses their mind that the kid could be an unwilling victim.	0
Why is the idea of the "nice" guy demonized so much on the internet?	There are lots of guys who think that doing nice things for a girl who is friendly to him will get him sex eventually. They seem to think that a woman's attraction can be bought with favors. Nice guys are only a big deal though when they are overly consistent or creepy, though. The typical guy who eventually get the message that the woman isn't interested in him and then backs off is more of a sad figure, really.	> the things that these guys do are mostly awkward and not malicious. Grand gestures for girls who barely know them with a strong sense of entitlement to that girls vagina comes to mind. I find that malicious and disgusting, personally.	1
How does your life at your current age compare to your mother's life at that age?	At 33, my mother had four boys who were approximately ages 10-15. She was a stay-at-home mom (I think) and fairly happily married to my father. She had no education after high school and would go on to have two more children (my other brother and me). She was very religious (still is) and close to her family. I'm 33, divorced, and live alone with my dog. I work writing tank manuals and am working on a master's degree. I have a boyfriend and am not religious at all.	22- she had just married her high school sweetheart, was a homeowner and working part time in a medical office. 22- living with bf/future hubby and our Australian shepherd. Just graduated college with a double BS and working as a nanny. We are still a couple years away from marriage :)	1
I became a first time mother to a son in January. What did your mom do right when raising you? What do you wish she'd known about raising a boy?	If you want to win mom of the year, just look up the reddit myth on the kid who broke both his arms.	There are two things my mom did that I always appreciated: There's that stereotype that men are hopeless without women but my mom always held my female peers to higher scrutiny. That way I could see that girls are just as flawed as boys and that I was worth something in a relationship. You could always hold someone to too much scrutiny and that would be an issue but she struck a balance that helped keep my romantic interests a bit more grounded. She would also always ask me if I could pause my video games before she asked me to do something. That was a very small courtesy but it was appreciated during boss battles.	0
What purchase for $100 or less has impacted your life the most in the past year?	Waist Cincher, Wig, and Bra for crossdressing, tbh. I know that's not the most manliest thing to write on r/AskMen, but it's been real destressifying to turn into a girl for an hour or two every few weeks or months.	Tongue scraper. This thing is cool as hell and makes my mouth feel much fresher. You can literally see the gunk cascading off of your tongue and you get a little confidence boost knowing your breath will be better. I couldn't believe I hadn't bought one sooner.	0
Married men with kids: how was sex different (good or bad) after your first baby? Was there any thing that could have made it better?	What sex? After my daughter was born I had two lovers. Ms. Hanna and Ms. Palm. Sex is dead. I’m dead on the inside too.	My wife didn’t do any of that, I watched my child be born in vivid detail and it had absolutely zero impact on our sex life. Obviously there was some downtime after the birth, but once we were back in the saddle is was just as often and satisfying as always. Still is 12 years and 3 kids later.	0
How do you "freshen up" quickly before sex?	I take a bath every day and shave everything, so I don't usually need to freshen up before sex. If I'm feeling particularly gross, I'll hop in the tub and use the handheld faucet to wash myself off.	Wet washcloth with warm water. Scrub gently. Pat dry with towel. I used to really like talcum powder, for staving off swamp ass throughout the day. I'd buy it in those little travel-sized containers. So portable and convenient! But of course, now I've seen all the TV lawyer ads, which solemnly promise that Johnson & Johnson is patiently waiting for its chance to use baby powder to make me grow ovaries, which will then grow tumors inside them and kill me. Betting on tap water not to fuck me up *too* badly. But who even knows anymore?	0
Men who have had a vasectomy, how did it improve, or destroy, your sex life?	SO doesn't need to take hormonal birth control anymore and her sex drive has improved, which has made my sex drive improve, which has made me fill her up more frequently, which makes the two of us very happy.	Improved incredibly. Im 27 and about to bareback an 18 year old on this lazy Sunday with no worry of pregnancy. How can it get any better than that? Single, no kids, no wife, no worries. Life is perfect.	1
How can I stop feeling like a loser because I'm a virgin even though I'm happy in all other areas of my life?	most comments here are actually bullshit. You do not feel like a loser for not having sex because society tells you. SEX IS A NORMAL NEED AND NOT HAVING IT IS BAD FOR YOU. It is good to try to have sex.Unfortunately if you did not have sex until now it usually is because you are not good looking. In recent years women only go for very good looking men especially when they are young and they do not give a change to men who are average. there has been a big change in the behavior of women in the last 30-40 years and it is in the detriment of the average and bottom looking men.	I'm going to disagree with everyone here who says "don't worry about it" or "it's not a big deal". If you want to have sex but aren't having it, you have to actively work toward making it happen (without letting your grades drop, of course - grades and sex are mutually compatible, and I shouldn't have to say it, but there are people who will argue against this). When you made out with those girls, did you want to and try to have sex with them?	0
Why is the ______ that you make the best _____ in the world?	nothing, I'm not quite that big of an egomaniac and I've worked with professional cooks since I was 15, no matter what it is there's some 65 year old somewhere who's been making that one dish since he was 12. That bit of pedanticism aside I make bomb ass food across the board thanks to the whole working with much better cooks since I was 15, my best stuff is probably fresh pasta. Raviolis with a mix of ricotta parm and asiago with an egg yolk nested in the middle before covering with the second sheet, cooked up then covered with a light chicken garlic sauce with cream and tomatoes, a bit of butter... It's like the fattiest thing on earth but it's so goddamn decadent I love it. Also make really good chashu with applejuice, butter and star anise in addition to the usual japanese seasonings	The sex I make is the best sex in the world, because I've enjoyed it more than all of the sex that I didn't make.	0
What is something that you've done to a woman that would make you mad if someone did the same to your daughter?	She said I love you. I said it back because I "had to", despite planning to break up with her. It's almost 2 years ago now, and I still hate myself for that.	Pulled her hair, choked her, spanked her, fucked her throat, fucked her in the ass, fucked another woman while she watched and diddled herself.... the list just goes on	1
At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission?	I feel that there is never all-encompassing implicit sexual permission, but at some point you should know what your partner likes and dislikes and should have a general idea on their limits. Since it is impossible to go over every scenario ever, you should be able to make generally accurate judgement calls on these things from the likes/dislikes/limits you have explicitly discussed. Personally, I don't think it's odd for a partner to maybe touch a butt or play with breasts while the other is asleep and so if I had an issue with it I would likely bring that up before it happens. If I didn't have the foresight for that, I would not be upset if I had to swat a hand away groggily, especially since I know my partner would listen and he would never intentionally do something I am uncomfortable with.	>At what point in the relationship is there implicit sexual permission? Never. >When is it, or is it ever, acceptable to simply assume sexual permission in a relationship? Never.	1
What advice would you give to women who struggle accepting their SO watch porn?	I have lots of anxiety about being denied sex, and masturbating to porn helps get me through the days I can't have sex with her.	Find someone who does not watch porn. Also find a dictionary and learn the difference between lust and love, as well as real and fake.	1
Couples who married young (18-21), how is your marriage now?	I got a Lass pregnant when we were both 19, I decided I'd better do the "right" thing and marry her. We've been married 12 years now and have 2 kids and it all worked out alright in the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.	I'm 21 he's 25, been married 2 months. :) I don't have any regrets. I love him, our beautiful house & two doggies. We have our ups & downs like everyone but I would love to see 10, 20 years in to the future and him still be there. I don't want to be married more than once. I'm happy I settled down. I met the perfect person for me and I only hope we can have a long happy life together.	1
How would you react to a guy friend of your girlfriend having a crush on her?	"needed help getting to her bed" mmmmhmmmmm. Woman here, was fully prepared to read something innocuous about a harmless crush. This? Fuck no.	The holding hands, and arms around her. Even carrying her to bed are all within the boundaries of a best friend. However, the fact they've already slept together changes everything. They're clearly attracted to each other and have no boundaries between them. I hate to break it to you but odds are she's already cheated on you with him. I'm attracted to psychos, it almost always ends badly. Don't be like me. You won't like the normal people if you stick with her too long.	1
what are some "bugs" in the human behavioral code?	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases So much interesting stuff there; so many ways for a person to be dead wrong but think they are right.	I want to buy something (a car, let's say). So I do a little research and find what I want. Search for cars matching those criteria. 1. "These guys want full price, fuck that!" 2. "This price is too good. There must be something wrong with it!"	0

You know that tangent you were about to go on in the middle of a conversation that would have totally derailed it but was a really good take, and you were kinda bummed you decided not to talk about it? What was that tangent?	How trump hamstringing federal bureaucracies isn’t the same as enacting good policy aimed at shrinking government. A better course of action, rather than unplanned budget freezes and 90% cuts is to ask for each organization to submit an efficiency plan with ways to cut their overhead. The people in those offices know where the waste is. Our government can be so much more efficient. Pulling the rug out from under them keeps them inefficient as well as ineffective. So don’t tell me you support Trump’s policies because it includes enacting said policies and “shrinking government bloat” needs to be done in a way that works. Slash and burn never works and that’s how companies go under.	My coworkers were discussing how funny it would be if someone in our industry (geoscience) was a flat earther. I wanted to talk about the guy who graduated first in my class in geological engineering who believed the earth was 4000 years old. I asked him about it once, his response was “God can make things seem older than they are.” Can’t argue with that.	0
What do you think about being in a long-term relationship with someone who has “less ambition” than you?	I’ve dated multiple people who didn’t have as much ambition as I did and all it really did was hold me back from opportunities and things I wanted to accomplish. After I got out of those relationships and I things for myself, it showed me I want to be with someone who’s ambitious and cares about where their life is going. Contentment is one thing, stagnancy is another.	Frankly, I suspect a relationship where both people are equally ambitious would be tough. What if one career offers a transfer to another city, and the couple has to choose whose career to prioritize, whose to hurt? As long as the less ambitious person realizes that long hours are a permanent part of the package and the more ambitious one realizes they'll be picking up the financial load, I don't see a problem with a "mixed" relationship in this way.	0
Just broke up with SO of a year, and he didn't even react. Has anyone else has a similar experience?	Not everyone processes emotional trauma in the same way. A friend of mine is a trauma surgeon. Sometimes he has to be the one to deliver the bad news to husbands, wives, parents, family members and loved ones. He’s told people their child has just died and received nothing back but a blank stare. Or seen people react to the bad news with seeming indifference. And he’s seen people become hysterical to the point they had to be medicated. In each case, I doubt it was that they didn’t care their child, wife, husband, etc., had just died. People just process trauma in different ways, and the same may well apply to your situation.	Why would him feeling bad make you feel better? You ended the relationship. If you had unfinished business you should have taken care of that before you decided to break up with him. Sorry for being blunt, but I have little patience for people who use breakups as a way to manipulate their relationships, which is what it sounds like you tried to do.	1
What online service is worth the monthly fee and why?	Netflix and Spotify. I listen to A LOT of music so definitely worth it for me and Netflix is just awesome.	Do yourself a favor and pay for an anti-virus for your devices, including PCs, tablets, and smartphones. It's usually a yearly subscription. Just Google "best anti-virus of [insert year]" and pick one from one of the articles. You can go with free, but you get what you pay for. I find many free ones to have annoying "features."	1
Why did you go No-Contact with your family, and how long has it been since you saw them or spoke to them?	I once went 3 months without talking to my mum. We live in the same house. Just got sick of her talking to me so i stopped responding.	They don't like me. It's really as simple as that. Every mistake I've made since birth is brought up over and over again. If I say something I'm 'too sensitive', if I don't react, they go a bit deeper. I've been in abusive relationships and these are the men my family like the most. Because they keep control of me. I finally stood up for myself this year, I'm 38, I wouldn't take this from friends so why should family be OK to do it? You get one life. Surround yourself with people who are true to you and actually care.	0
What are your "I can't believe I was in that relationship" stories?	Jesus. I was thinking about answering this question about this guy I dated for 2 years in college who ended up being a drug addict and was horrible to me. I googled him and just found his obituary. Shit.	generally a weenie- avoided confrontation, hated cheesecake, loved cats (i'm a dog person), and was really close with somebody else but "she lived too far away so nothing would ever happen". Looking back on it I remember thinking "Do I even LIKE him?". The answer was no, but I stayed and I have nothing but regret because it kept me from doing things that I really wanted to do at that time in my life. And in the end he was a not nice guy.	1
when did you realize you haven't matured yet?	My daughter made a Christmas wish list and stuck it on the fridge last fall. One of the items was for her to move into the guest bedroom, and since we just painted her bedroom last summer, this irritated me. So I promptly took down the list, drew a stick figure ninja with a flame thrower burning that line with the words "DIE DIE DIE" in a speech bubble above his head, and put it back up on the fridge. I'm 37.	If someone says twist the titty and it ain't a beast they are referring to, your always allowed to laugh. That's not maturity, it's mandatory.	0
what are some of the best decisions you have made in your life?	I started lifting about a year ago. I used to be one of those girls who never wanted to pick up a weight but my friend finally convinced me to do it and I became addicted. I never knew how empowering it would be to be physically strong. I'm slowly getting my female friends to lift and they're enjoying it too (:	Seeing a therapist. Went from having disturbed sleep every night for half a year to no troubles. I no longer freeze in panic/anxiety in lots of situations. I learnt how to be more open with my wife and have a much better relationship for it Asking a doctor to help me and getting the referral was one of the best things I ever did.	0

Has anyone long-term dated or married an SO that was less motivated/ ambitious/successful than you? How did it turn out?	Poorly, because his laziness drove me up a wall. He had "absolutely no idea" why his teachers hated him (he was a failed class clown), claimed they "gave him bad grades on purpose" (hint: that's not how it works) and that he just "couldn't get good grades" but he also "wasn't stupid". I told him very explicitly that I wasn't going to marry someone who had no chance of success or goals in life. He took it about as well as he could.	My husband is very much the laid-back, low-key compliment to my type-A ambition. That's not to say he doesn't have ambitions; he has a lot of things that he works toward that are important to him, but they aren't money-making or prestige driven. It took him a while to find the things that were important to him. We've been married for about three years and lived together for seven-ish before that. It's working out great for us. He has a freelance writing career and does some odd jobs and pursues his interests; I work in a career I love. I am the breadwinner, but he takes care of the house, makes me dinner and lunches to take to work and just generally takes care of me. I love it.	0
Why are so many people in the dating scene in competition with each other over who cares the least?	I think its from the throwaway culture that has moved into dating now. Why bother to put in any effort to a Tinder or Bumble match conversation when you can just swipe 50 more times and get new ones? It's the feeling that there's always something better hiding around the corner so any perceived minor flaw becomes a deal breaker. The problem is 2-5 messages don't usually actually show any flaws, it's just people's unrealistic expectations to begin with.	We live in a culture that is easily offended by anything and everything. All in a sad attempt to prevent hurting feelings. This bleeds over into the dating scene as well, but in an interesting way. The one who cares the most in the relationship tends to be hurt the most. So to combat that, people adopt an attitude of not caring. Not saying that it's not needed to some degree but to an extreme is a set up for failure.	1
I should've have realized when my boyfriend at the time said horrible things about his ex wife, ex girlfriend, and other ladies he dated, that once we broke up he would start talking shit about me. What has happened in a relationship that you overlooked but shouldn't have?	i had a boyfriend say "if you had your body, but (a girl we both know)'s face, you'd be perfect" and "i'll probably meet someone better than you in the summer". i was extremely low on self-esteem at the time, so i just agreed with him both times. i definitely shouldn't have. putting me down a lot = wouldn't have been a good relationship in the long run.	Hmm with one of my last relationships I said bad things about my previous partners but I have since had two partners and have not bad mouthed her to either. Right now I am in a long distance kinda stressful relationship so I bite my tongue with quite a few things in order to make the relationship work out. I probably shouldn't but I think only time will tell.	1
Those of you who picked the wrong career (for you), when did you realize you weren't on the right track?	I was a grocery store manager and was facing the reality that I was just a number to the company as opposed to an asset. That's how I treated my employees and was naïve to think that was how the company was supposed to treat me. Then one morning I go in to work and ended up watching 9/11 happen live on the TV in the office. I talked to an Army recruiter that week and put in my notice. After 15 years of loyalty the company didn’t try once to get me to stay. Not even an exit interview. I’m still in the Army. It has its ups and downs but my worst day in Iraq was still better than my best day working for them.	I started working on arts during high school, hated it and switched next year. Now I wanna be a software engineer :]	1
What's the worst thing you've overheard someone saying about you?	During college I was walking to class one day and a car goes by and I could hear a guy saying "she's ugly". They were probably checking my ass, since I was wearing tight leggings and I have a nice butt. Guess he didn't like the rest. I can honestly say it didn't bother me too much, by that point I'd made peace with my looks.	In highschool I was super shy somewhat depressed had few friends and was a general loner. I overheard someone say they thought I would shoot up the school one day.	0
Just chased down a lady who hit my car, what is your most ridiculous car accident story?	A few hours ago I barely grazed this dudes car. I guess he noticed because a few mins later he was LITERALLY CHASING ME DOWN FOR MILES. Geez, what happened to chivalry, aren’t you men supposed to show some respect to us women?	I got rear-ended, pulled over, and the guy who hit me pulled over. The first thing he says was "It's not my fault. My brakes don't work." Whatttttt	0
What things do men say to try and be caring, but achieve the opposite?	"Text me when you make it home." No, I'm a damn independent woman and can walk 10 blocks in my own neighborhood just fine. (I know some women like that, but I don't)	When faced with any mundane decision - "I don't care, I'll let you decide". Like it's a favor to me to have to choose dinner, date location, movie, etc. every single time. To be fair I'm sure this isn't a man specific thing.	0
For anyone who meal plans/meal prep, what are you eating for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks this week?	We make smoothies for breakfast every morning. I bring grapes as a snack, and this week we made chili for lunch! It's finally feeling like fall here, which means it's crockpot season!	Breakfast: scrambled eggs with cottage cheese, or cereal (bran flakes) Lunch: salad (carrot, cucumber, iceberg lettuce, chickpeas, corn) or soup! Dinner: teriyaki chicken or honey mustard chicken and veg (carrots, onions, pumpkin, cauliflower, cabbage)	1
I once pulled a knife on a guy to get him to back off me. What's the craziest thing you've done after saying 'no' didn't work?	Yesterday I got out of a cab when he was stopped at a red light. He kept asking me for my number, made me take his number and repeat it to him, tried to force me to call his number from my phone. Asked me where I lived, where I worked, said that, "we can be friends, right? We should be friends." Insisted I should call him if anyone ever threatens to hurt me (??). I tried to call someone on my phone so he would stop speaking to me but he just kept asking me to hang up so at a red light I left him a ten and got out of the car. He followed me in the cab for a block or so, so I went into a bank and he drove away. UGH.	When I was a kid, out to recess with my buddies, We had one table we all liked to sit at. One of my friends thought it would be funny to lay across the bench and take up 3 spaces. Being a kid, I told him 'move, or I'll shit on you.' He looked at me like 'yeah, right.' I decided it was time to nut the fuck up, I pulled my pants down just past my ass, and squatted over his face. Just as the turtle started poking his head out, he screamed and got up. My butthole puckered and retrieved my shit. Guy never doubted me again	1
Women in STEM fields, what instances of sexism have you faced at work/school?	Whenever I interact with the public, the questions I receive are way different if I am alone or with a female coworker compared to when I am with a male coworker. When with a male coworker, they always default to addressing him when asking questions even though I know much more about the project. They also tend to ask more in-depth questions. When I'm with a female coworker or alone the questions are always really basic or just something about how cute the wildlife I study is... I also have had issues where the men at work take credit for my ideas. They will take my suggestions and present it as their own idea.	I’m a college student majoring in computer science. Luckily, I haven’t gotten too much trouble because most guys in CS are excited to have a girl there, lol. I have had guys doubt my coding skills though. When we’re working on a group project and I suggest a certain technique, it will sometimes get ignored only to later be brought up again by a guy. And everyone listens to him. *smh* But really, I’m happy to say that I haven’t experienced too much sexism. Edit: Side story, I had a guy say to me that he was glad to see so much female empowerment in this one movie we were discussing. The movie had of a lot of degrading sex scenes with women, and he thought it was great that they were “exploring their sexuality”. *Sigh*	0
What should you absolutely ask for on your wedding registry?	Money. Edit: apparently this is unpopular, but that's normal where I'm from and the only useful wedding gift I received.	One of the best presents we got was a garbage can for the kitchen. Not just any garbage can it was this nice steel and black looking one that you don’t touch w your hands. You just tap it w your feet and it opens up. I’ve been married 9 years and it still works. It’s one of those things you don’t think to buy but when it lasts you quite a bit you realize that it’s a damn good present lol	0
Have you ever gone to bed with a girl and then been shocked or put off by something once the clothes came off? Did either of you mention it at any point and how did you both react?	I once had a surprise with a skinny girl. I took off her bra to find no boobs. What I thought were her boobs were total padded bras. Her nipples were adult feminine, but she was truly flat chested. She completely made up for it with a vag of perfection, sexual enthusiasm and action, and no fear/shame of me playing with what boobage she did have.	Wow, people can be douchey. It really doesn't matter. You wouldn't date someone for their car, right? So why would anyone pick a partner spirit based on their body? It's just a vehicle for the soul, man.	1
Men who aren't passionate about anything, what type of career did you get into?	So you think your passion, if you have any, should be your rice bowl even if it pays you poorly? Think my career is my rice bowl and not the center of my life.	I have an intellectual passion in Philosophy (Bachelors) and sporting passion in Soccer (Currently coach kids). But battling depression makes a lot of shit I know I am and should be passionate about pretty muted. I have a masters in Accounting and work as a financial and inventory analyst for a medical supply company. I've automated a lot of what I do, so work flies by and I kind of just sit there with headphones on--not playing any music. I just don't want people bugging me. \-Elmo shrug-	0
What is the most challenging issue women face when they have long hair?	In high school it was those chairs with the two buttons on top. My hair would swirl around in them and get ripped out when I would stand up. Brutal.	I feel kinda privileged here. It's down to the small of my back now, almost there to my goal of the bottom of my bum. I can just put my hair above my pillow and it stays all night. It's straight and I need only brush it for a minute in the morning and at night before bed, or before I go out. The only "challenge" I have is its heavy, and I need to use multiple hair ties to keep it up in a high pony, so usually I use a low boring pony. Otherwise, for me and my hair type just letting it be long is the easy way out, it mostly takes care of itself.	1
When do you tell your friend that his girlfriend js a gold-digger?	so what makes you think your friend is blind. He sees what you see. He's not dumb and knows he's being used just like she's being used for her bimbo looks. That is often the kind of interaction men with money make with golddiggers. Unless he's a dumbass who needs his friends to point out the obvious, he knows. LOL, does he think she actually finds him fascinating/sweet/cool/interesting/any of the above? No, no he does not care. He cares about having an annoying little airhead on his arm as eye candy and you getting all outraged is... laughable. He knows where his money is going, he knows what he paid for.	So my first question is about his ex, what's her relationship with your friend? Did he dump her and does she want him back, does she just dislike this girl because she's dating her ex boyfriend?	0
How many of you stalk ON FACEBOOK - Exes, exes new partners, Exes...exes, People you don't like? How far have you gone? For how long? WHY?	I stalk everyone, all the time. Seriously. Once, I got as far as my ex's ex GFs old Livejournal that hadn't been updated since 2008. I'm a master stalker and i'm not ashamed.	I don't even use facebook.. it's toxic, in my opinion. I try to allow people to have their space and privacy and tell me things as they choose to, not stalk around trying to be nosy. A couple times in the past I've quickly checked on people just because they had been out of my life for awhile and wanted to see how they were doing but nothing creepy. That's one of the reasons I try to make it difficult to search for me, honestly. It's fucking unnerving thinking friends, family, or a partner might try to look that deeply into my life without me knowing. It's nothing I wouldn't tell them anyway - it's just the idea of it.	1
Guys, when did you realise that the time has come to propose?	Beware. You say she says one thing then proceeds to do the opposite. Example, doesn't want to move fast... bang, your living together... say she doesn't want to move fast... when are you going to make one of the most important decisions of your life, quick, quick propose. Have you met the parents? What's the hurry? If you continue to see divergence between spoken and action it may be the character of the individual. Things have a tendency to magnify and be more evident over time. Worst case scenario: promises to love and honor then... 7 years in you are replaced but still paying the mortgage... no longer loving and no honor. Been there, done that. Best wishes.	My SO was moving into my place and having a hard time with her flat mate. She finally snapped at her “Sara, it’s been great living with you for three years, but I want to spend my *whole life* with X, so this *is* happening” When I heard that later I was hit in the feels massively and I realised I felt the same. Proposed the next day.	0
What are the details of couples that you know that show perfect lives on social media, but in their private lives it is a different story?	My older sister has this perfect little Facebook Family, but she is the most financially irresponsible human being I have ever met in my life. She'll throw a massive birthday party for her two-year-old that she spent literally thousands of dollars on and hire a professional photographer to document the whole thing and post it all over Facebook to show the world she's the perfect mom, all while she's maxing out her credit cards and overdrafting her bank account every other week.	Couple 1: Lots of couple trips, dinners, fancy drinks, couple selfies. He doesn't go down on her. Couple 2: Trips, dinners, couple selfies, cute posts about eachother. He has ED and last year they didn't have sex at all.	1
What was the "last straw" that ended your last relationship? Was it a sum of a bunch of little things? Or a couple big things?	He ruined my birthday. We were out with friends and he was in a nasty mood all night. Finally he yelled at me about wanting to leave already while I was saying goodbye to my friends, and they all laid into him. Seeing my friends that upset with him because of how he was treating me, I knew it was over right there.	A whoooooooooooole bunch of little things followed by one really, really big thing and I was like nah nope gtg	1
What is the strangest incompatibility you've had with an SO?	His stomach can't handle food that's been left out on the counter overnight. I can let food sit out on the counter for three or more days, and as long as it passes the sniff test, it's getting in my belly.	She didn't like thinking about anything outside of her immediate surroundings. She would get upset if I talked about space or even other countries. Apparently thinking of things like that made her uncomfortable.	0
What is the hottest non-sexual act a girl can do?	State where she wants to eat with neither hesitation nor delay. In theory, at least, that would be hot AF.	When they are not smoking a cigarette. Once they put up a cigarette I don't care how attractive they are, it's a No from me	1
Dad's of Reddit, what is the number one tip you can give to someone who just found out his wife is pregnant?	Great advice here, but on the more serious side of things, I know you’re excited, but don’t start telling people yet. Miscarriage is SUPER common (20% of pregnancies abort in the first trimester). No one takes about it ever, but it really fucking sucks, and it’s 10x worse when you have to “untell” everyone you told. People don’t know how to react, and it’s really painful and weird for everyone involved. Absolutely no announcements on Facebook yet, and honestly don’t tell anyone you wouldn’t be comfortable untelling. But now that that shitty lecture is over, congratulations! Really try to step up the housework and patience on your part, because your poor wife is about to be really sick and miserable for a couple months. And don’t take it personally when mood swings go nuts around week 8-9.	Remember. It's not "my wife is pregnant" it's "We are pregnant". It's a shared experience. There best part of this is that it works both funny and serious.	1
Would it bother you if your girlfriend remained good friends with her ex of 5 years?	It's a problem in this case because he's still pining for her. If it was purely platonic I doubt I would have a problem, but would monitor a bit for warning signs.	I'm best friends with an ex of mine. It would be hypocritical not to. I also think that having a problem with the dude is at least partly insecure. Then again, maybe she should use a different word than "love."	1
What do you consider a disturbingly common bad science "fact"?	I've seen this [Tumblr quote/poem](https://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Breakup+feels_8d9fbd_5090851.jpg) floating around fairly often, whether it's on Facebook or whatever -- the idea that "every cell in your entire body" is destroyed and replaced every 7 years. I get that it sounds poetic, but it's incorrect. RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days, skin epidermal cells are sloughed off every 2-4 weeks, the epithelial lining of your mucosa (think -your GI/oral cavity areas) is also sloughed off and replaced every few days, some of the cells of your immune system only live hours to less than 2 days, osteocytes have an average half life of 25 years, and although the research on this is ongoing, neurons can potentially last a lifetime (although pruning does happen in your adolescent years). To slap this arbitrary, scientifically incorrect number (and to attribute it to a professor!) on the body's complex apoptotic and regenerative cycles is just ridiculous.	"The wage gap isn't real" and "there are two genders." The wage gap actually exists, but it's not what you think it is. All of the conservative/MRA/fascist/etc. "critiques" of the wage gap end up fundamentally misunderstanding what the gap *is* and *adjusting for the gap itself* to disprove it. Conservatives/fascists/MRAs/etc. also fail miserably when it comes to understanding things like gender and sex. They screech "facts don't care about your feelings," but their arguments are literally tradition and feelings-based. It has nothing at all to do with science. Nearly all of the relevant scholarship backs up "le SJWs" on this one. Basically any time a reactionary claims "facts don't care about your feelings" you can be sure that they're, in fact, making an argument from emotion. It's an old fash trick to accuse your opponent of the thing you, yourself are doing.	1
What was your most recent "I am not a smart man" moment?	My friend and I were unable to find a bunch of emails for the longest time. Turns out they'd ended up in the junk mail folder.	About to get into car. Notice scratch that wasn't there when I left it. Slightly raging. Follow scratches along the car to where they end, near the back lights. Rage intensifies. Ranting and swearing begins. Notice JD Sports bag in the back window of the car. Don't remember going to JD Sports. Don't remember my Peugeot having a VW badge. Turns out it isn't my car. See own car 2 spaces down. Such relief. Slink into it and drive away.	0
Why is 30 described as the magical age for guys?	Men age like wine; women age like milk. As you get older, your perceived value to society increases. This is because a) men tend to become more attractive, as well as more manly, as they age and b) the experience and stability that comes with being in the labour market for that long is attractive to people. So work out and stay healthy.	I do believe that men generally have an easier time on the dating market when they're older while women generally have an easier time when they're younger. Women are more likely to prioritize confidence, charisma, and success in a partner, and these things grow over time. Men are more likely to prioritize youth and physical beauty in a partner, and these things start higher but fade over time. These aren't absolutes but they're trends. But "just wait until you're 30" is awful advice. First of all, it's not like men in their teens and early 20s (or women in their 30s) are undateable or can't possibly succeed. Plenty do. And second of all, your charisma, confidence, and success aren't going to increase on their own. You have to put effort into this stuff. Thinking that everything will magically change in your favour when you're 30 is naive.	0
What are your thoughts on taking a consenting disabled individual to a sex worker?	If It were me, I would. Just take all the necessary precauctions. Make sure he understands the situation and don't let him think that it's anything other than pay for sex. Explain that the woman are doing it for money and even if they say they like you it isn't true.	I think that's very sweet. Just find a decent escort, don't just pick up someone on the street. Do your research and find the right girl for him. Swap a few emails back and forth, and don't be afraid to ask the girls for recommendations on who they think might be good if they don't want to do it. Just understand that most won't discuss actual sex acts over email.	1
Opening the door to girlfriend in lingerie - yay or nay?	A healthy man will always take sex over rest. He might want a shower first though after traveling. Answer the door in the towel and offer to take a shower with him or some shit. That sounds good to me.	It's a great idea, just make sure he is coming home alone (i.e. his aunt isn't coming by for a surprise visit)	0
How do your personal experiences clash with the common consensus you see on the Internet?	I honestly don't believe there's such a thing as a radical feminist, and cherrypicked tumblr posts aren't evidence. Feminism is about equal rights, and the majority of people that go on reddit are feminists, even if they don't classify themselves as ones.	Internet dating is difficult. I know so many couples that have met via it. (we were at a wedding reception on Saturday, and met 4 other couples who meet via okcupid)	0
How often do you drink?	Most evenings i'll have 2/3 pints of beer, on Friday and Saturday night that number will be closer to 8/9	3-5 days a week. A bottle of wine a night isn't too bad, although what's his weekends like? > Side note/personal question: Would it be rude of me to ask him not to drink when we are out for dinner with my parents? I would bring it up that your parents brought it up to you.	1
What are your unpopular opinions about food?	Not quite an answer to your question because I kind of like everything. I'm actually having trouble thinking of a food I don't like or will at least eat. However, a lot of my friends are vegetarians. Like the kind that constantly post videos of animals being slaughtered on Facebook along with sad sounding music and commentaries on how inhuman it makes me to eat meat. I still like my fois gras. They can all shove it.	I don't like warm, or even room temperature fruit. I like my fruit to be cold, especially if you bite into it and there's a juice.	0
I went to Taco Bell yesterday, ordered at the drive thru, paid for my food and absentmindedly drove off without my food when they handed back my debit card. What dumbfuck thing have you done recently?	Last Wednesday this chick I know bought a taco from Taco Bell. There was a pubic (I think) hair stuck to the wrap.	Recently saw stopped school bus with red lights flashing. I stopped and waited. Eventually remembered I was not in a car; I was walking. Went into client office where they immediately asked why I was standing on the sidewalk \[like an idiot\].	0
Should I break things off so early on due to difference in sex drive?	2 weeks? You deserve someone who makes you feel attractive and wanted, life is too short to settle for someone who only thinks you're good looking enough to have sex with once every 2 weeks.	Life is short, op. seriously. If I had a to do over, I wouldn't put up with that stuff. If you haven't been going out for very long, find someone else... Or at the bare minimum do not make it exclusive.	0
My cat likes to steal my make up brushes and play with them. What does your cat do that pisses you off?	My cat morphed into a dog so I'm totally happy now! He doesn't do anything wrong 98% of the time.	She yowls all night long. If she can get into the bathtub, that's her favorite spot to do it because of the acoustics. It's like she's trying out for American Idol.	0
Does your partner use a condom as an addition to your own birth control product?	We both hate the feel of condoms, so we rely on the withdrawal method which has worked great for almost six years now. My man has super control so I'm not worried about an accidental pregnancy.	Yes, because even with the pill we are afraid we will be one of the unlucky who slip through the cracks and gets pregnant. We have had sex without the condom a handful of times though.	0
Tired of smoking weed and it's become a soft addiction. Dudes who quit smoking pot, how's life after giving up the devils lettuce?	It sounds like you're looking for an easy way out but there is none. You will go through withdrawal and feel like shit and have intense urges for a couple of weeks. You might even feel like killing yourself. But if you get through it, you will be glad on the other side, because it sounds like that's what you want	I gave it up for the wife. I must admit that I really don't miss it. I think a bit clearer now, more motivated in some aspects, but I did like doing yard work while stoned.	0
Men, do your female friends become really 'jealous' when you show interest in a woman?	Female perspective here: something like that happening could be one of two situations. 1....they either care about you now or cared about you in the past, ROMANTICALLY, and are comparing themselves to her. They probably don't realize they're doing this. But they are. So they're definitely going to be vocal about all that crap. It's a pacifier. 2....they don't care about you romantically, but they truly do care about you a LOT...and they're the judgmental type to begin with.	Sometimes, which doesn't make sense to me, because my female friends either have a boyfriend, or we've had romantic feelings and I expressed mine, and they said they only see me as a friend. I mean if you only see me as a friend, then why are you getting butthurt when I mention a girl I'm talking to atm?	0
Man of Reddit, How do you stop a porn addiction that ruins your daily life?	When people try to quit a vice, they often retreat into a new one. For a lot of people, this vice is food, but that can be counter productive because you’ll get sad that you’re gaining weight and retreat to the comfort of your own addiction. Find a new outlet for dopamine, something new to keep you busy. Whenever you feel the need, force yourself to the gym. This will help you in the later steps. Do your best to stay in public. Walking around your town, out a coffee shop, where ever. Just dont be alone in your room with a laptop.	Such a big struggle that people overlook and think it’s normal, had a meathead from over r/testosterone arguing with me telling me I’m a loser for not wanting to masturbate and telling me to get some nice pictures and do my thing, it’s not normal to watch other people have sex. That’s weird. It’s addicting and many people like it but it’s not good for you.	1
Guys, What is something that your S.O. Does that makes you smile?	I go to sleep later then she does. 9/10 times she will be knocked out cold but as soon as I get into bed she rolls over and wraps around me. love it everytime.	When she really wants something she does this cute little baby talk, and does a little dance when I agree to her request. Gets me every time :3	1
Hi ladies, what is something you would like to talk about right now but have nobody to talk to?	Been married five days, already received two cards addressed to Mr and Mrs [HisLastName]. I am not changing my name. I'm Ms [MyLastName] just like before. Just the fact people assumed and didn't even fucking ask me! (There are people I could talk to but I'm not gonna text them out of nowhere just to complain.)	I'm getting fact checking fatigue and it's making me really disappointed in people and apathetic toward politics. I'm super liberal but I see just as many liberals as conservatives passing off nonsense as facts and posting stupid memes covered in lies. And then when I very politely post a reliable source that proves the lie is a lie, I get called nasty names, or sometimes they'll say "Okay, thanks for providing a source!" and then they're reposting the same shit the next day. I don't get it. You have access to the greatest information source ever to exist and yet you can't be bothered to google whatever crap your posting and liking and upvoting.	0

Attn: shy/introverted men. What makes a woman more approachable in your opinion?	I think with all this cat calling and male gaze talk going around guys in general are less likely to initiate a conversation. I'm pretty outgoing and I have a hard time starting a conversation because I don't want to be thought of as sexist, sometimes even if I'm 99% sure she wants to talk.	Let's see, if you insist on being approached rather than approaching yourself, then this is my advice: * Doing things alone - If you're always in a group then you're less likely to be approached by a shy/introverted man because he's more likely to be by himself too. * Being the first to smile - A shy/introverted guy is less likely to be aggressive, so by smiling you signal that you are available to be approached for conversation. * If you are hanging out with a friend or friends, not conversing too loudly or being the "loud one" in the group - Some shy/introverted guys like opposites, but most shy introverts would rather be with someone who seems to have a quiet introspective personality like themselves.	0
What is your funny or strange Pavlovian response?	If I see a mouse on the ground, I jump down to try to catch it. Years of working in a research lab, if someone dropped a mouse, you quickly try to pick it up. I was parking my bike downtown and saw a little field mouse slowly walking by. I was halfway down to it when I realized I shouldn't try to pick up wild mice.	I grew up going to a Mexican restaurant every Sunday. Now every time I pass a Spanish music channel on the radio, I crave chips and salsa.	1

Fellas who have removed all their pubic hair, how is it working out for ya?	It was really nice and breezy to be honest, and not nearly as much ball-stuck-to-leg action as I expected! Would recommend	I wax and in general it's nice (takes like 15-30 minutes once a month) though the pain (it's really not that painful) and cost might not be for everyone. In general, shaving is annoying because when the hair starts growing in, it is a blunt edge (which makes it seem thicker) and is a lot itchier than with waxing. Also for me, I get less ingrown hairs with waxing which is also a bonus. If you do shave, don't shave around your asshole, it becomes the worst thing ever as hair grows in.	1
why is twerking supposed to be sexy?	I used to be like you. Then my wife jokingly did it in front of me naked. It drove me bananas.	I find twerking to be vulgar, not sexy. Eastern dance and bellydance (like Shakira) is super sexy and requires much more effort than just shaking your ass.	1
Does anyone really only spend time with their SO?	Aside from work (where I sit in a cubicle wearing headphones and have little interaction with my coworkers), I spend the bulk of my interaction time with my SO. Most of my friends don't live in this city, or we've grown apart, so I don't see my own friends very often. I hang out with my SO's friends (with or without him) maybe once a month, otherwise my social interaction is mainly with him. It bothers me a little because if we break up I'm probably going to become a hermit, but I was a hermit before we met and I did all right. I like it though. He's the only person I don't find it draining to be around, because we're capable of sitting in the same room, doing different things, together but not. And I like the quiet little life we've made for ourselves.	Nope. My boyfriend and I are really independent people. We obviously enjoy being together, but maintaining separate groups of friends is extremely important to both of us. We have separate hobbies as well. Even when we go so social events, we immediately part ways to interact with others (touching base over the course of the evening). This is the type of relationship I've always preferred to have.	1
What well-intentioned thing has gone wrong for you?	I bought my friend froyo and put mango on it because I thought Asians love mango...and it turned out he was allergic to it. He plucked the chunks off and ate it anyway, but he thought my reasoning was hilarious.	i offered someone a bag for their dog's poop because the dog pooped and the person started walking away, and she completely flipped out on me and called me a nosy c-word and some other things. how was i supposed to know she was just a lazy POS and left the house without a bag on purpose?	0
What's the angriest you've ever been at another Redditor?	To anyone who was upset because you were harassed across multiple subreddits by someone, report that shit to the mods of the subreddit(s) as well as the admins. That shit doesn't fly anywhere, and the more people snitching, the quicker something will get done about it.

Among people you know, do women sometimes treat their male partners in a way that would be considered inappropriate if the roles were reversed?	The dumb, incompetent husband is the only negative stereotype still widely used and accepted in media and marketing for a reason.	I know a few people like that. It's also a common joke that women have to "train" their husbands. I think that's ridiculous. My husband is his own person, I married him for the person he is. The only time I really ask him to change his behavior is if he does something that hurts my feelings, which is not very often. I don't see the need to boss him around like a child or a dog.	0
When you "read between the lines" on somebody's dating profile, what do you really see?	"These days I'm more interested in staying in and watching Netflix then going out partying all night." I used to be super sexually adventurous and had sex with a staggering number of partners. Now I want to "settle down" with a guy who will support me and be satisfied with once a week starfish sex.	"I love to laugh"/"I love to have fun"/"I love to travel"/Emoji Spam - I'm too lazy to fill out a dating profile, so I rely on cliches to pad length like a poorly written high school essay.	0
Are Male Teachers Sexual Eunuchs?	Your friend is talking out her ass. Think about it, you're going into an industry where *there are more women than men* and you think that puts you at a disadvantage meeting women? How does that even slightly begin to make sense? I can't imagine a scenario where years later in your life you'd look back at that time you traded your dreams for a soul crushing job just because you thought it'd get you more pussy and then patted yourself on the back. That whole idea is crazy.	Obviously exceptions are going to exist, all my male teachers were married growing up. However, it's definitely true there are professions that women see as sexy (doctor for example) and those they find generally unsexy (nurse as another example). I don't think it's a coincidence that the professions women find sexy tend to come with a lot of power and prestige. If that is what motivates you to do a career, I suggest you consider that when making a career choice, because again while it isn't an inherent deal breaker it won't make things easier on you.	1
My coworkers call me a hippie just because I'm from Austin, Tx and I eat organic. What irritating thing happens to you at work?	My boss is really weird and questions everything, like she thinks we're constantly lying to her and making stuff up. If she's never heard of it before, her first response is to think it isn't real. Example: Yesterday we were eating pizza in the office and some of my co-workers started talking about Showbiz Pizza and the animatronic band of animals from when we were kids. My boss suddenly got this weird look on her face and asked us what an animatronic was, then when we explained it, she had to go look it up because she didn't believe any of us. ...Why would we make some shit up like that? It irritates me.	Well, it depends on which side of the divide you're on. If you're pre-80s Austin, you're a real Texan. If you're post, there's a good chance you're a hippie. If you're a transplant, go back to California.	1
How does your SO initiate sex? How do you like it?	only one of my girlfriends ever initiated sex. She would start groping me, take off my pants, grab my dick and "drag" me to the bed. Loved it. My girlfriends after that never did initiate. I've always had to be the one to initiate which sucks. I want to feel wanted too.	Reading this thread simply confirms my theory that I have a man's sex drive. When dating guys in the past, sometimes I see him walk by, grab him by the waist or arm, and tell him that we needed to fuck...NOW. Can't walk by me when he just gets out of the shower and is only wearing a towel, because I will pull that thing off and suck him dry. Bending over at any time? I will slap his ass and tell him how good looking he is. I guess part of this is because I'm a bigger, curvy lady who thoroughly enjoys sex and I want my partner to know that he makes me hot (and wet). I want him to know that I find him attractive and enjoy having sex with him.	1
Ladies who have ever discovered their SO had a fetish that made you uncomfortable, how have you dealt with it?	I don't think both people have to be into the same things if there's communication and boundaries and a good give and take. I had an ex though that if it wasn't his thing (anal), he wasn't into it. I was down on occasion but it was such a shitty attitude that caused me to nope out. We rarely did engage in anything sexual for a long while. I ended up having to have sex with other people during our relationship to fill my need for regular sex.	My ex had a foot fetish and used to ask me to fuck him in this position where I'd sit on his cock and lean back with my feet in his face. I could actually *feel* him swelling up inside me when I did it, but the position did nothing for me and he actually ended up complaining that my feet didn't smell enough. Was a killer exercise for my abs though, so there's that.	0
Is there a stigma surrounding women doing "men stuff" similar to the one around men doing "feminine stuff"?	a lot of women are told they're just doing it to get attention from men. like the whole "fake geek girl" thing, where men think their dumb favorite tv show or game is so unique that no woman could possibly be interested in it, so they have to quiz you on really dumb facts nobody cares about.	If you're a cute girl? Definitely not. A pretty lady who is into wood working, metal smithing, weight lifting, home/car repair, computer building, gaming, sports, or any other stereotypical "male" activity will usually get a lot of attention from guys and women will often have a "girl crush". If you're not hot? It really depends on your attitude as to whether people will view this as a positive or negative thing.	1
Have you ever had a dream which makes you sad after you wake up?	Have you ever had a dream that you, um, you had, your, you- you could, you’ll do, you- you wants, you, you could do so, you- you’ll do, you could- you, you want, you want them to do you so much you could do anything?	Had a dream where I ran into someone who had stopped talking to me that I missed very much. We caught up and it felt so good, I woke up feeling so much joy because it had been so vivid. After a few seconds I realized I was still in my room and I had just woken up, and wave of intense sadness washed over me.	0
What's the dumbest thing someone has called the cops on you for?	We had the cops called on us because it was Christmas day and my entire family was drunkenly playing baseball in the hallway of the hotel we were at and my uncle was being really belligerent to the hotel manager when he asked us to stop.	A guy who backed into a dumpster at an apartment complex called the cops and claimed I backed into his car and then ran off. As soon as I showed up, the cop dismissed it as I had no damage to the bumper of my vehicle, nor any paint scraped on it. Also, the paint scraped on his car was blue (matching the dumpster) and my vehicle was brown. It was also a pickup truck, where as his car was an older toyota, and due to the height of my vehicle, it was impossible that I would have hit him where he claimed I did, as the point of impact would be much higher.	0
Has your SO ever asked you something, out of mere curiosity, which made you feel insecure?	Not my SO yet, but on our 1st date she asks whether I've been in a relationship before, and then when I say no she asks why not. Shit made me so insecure and nervous.	I asked my bf if he watches porn and it was like pulling teeth getting him to answer! I LOVE porn, he knows this info.... He does, he says, but why he's embarrassed, I'll never know	1
Do you ever get offended by the standard of men who show interest in you?	I'm not offended by men showing interest in me, I'm offended based on HOW they show interest. I won't get upset at someone mentioning it casually, in fact I'll be flattered. However, if you catcall me on the street at 7am because you think I have a nice ass, go fall off a cliff.	offended when they show interest, no. offended when they actually try to pursue me as if they have a reasonable chance, absolutely.	1
When's the last time you went to urgent care or the ER? What happened?	I was trying to sleep when I had this weird feeling on my left side. Felt a little discomfort and then it quickly turned to pain. It was gradually becoming worse to the point where even laying in the fetal position didn't help. Had my husband drive me to the ER where I then threw up because the pain was so bad. Kidney stones. I have never felt a pain so horrible. Luckily it happened Thursday evening/Friday morning because we left for the Dominican Republic that following Sunday.	I had a concussion for about a week and then it all of a sudden got really bad one day. Dizziness, extreme disorientation, migraine. Spent 4+ hours in the ER and over $400 worth of tests only to tell me I have a concussion and sent me home. Thanks, doc, I had no idea.	1
Sweaty/stinky women of reddit, what is your holy grail antiperspirant + deodorant?	Mitchum. I’ve been using it since I was 13. 31 now. I have used Dove, Secret, Degree, Toms (ugh I hate this one), Speed Stick whenever I had wanted to try something new & I always go back to Mitchum. It’s just a clean scent & I never feel like I need to reapply.	I don't use antiperspirant because it's not that great for you. Deodorant wise I use a men's old spice with deodorant only. They have some that include antiperspirant but I avoid those. The fiji scent is pretty nice and they have other scents that aren't to "manly." Sometimes I have to get it online because a lot of stores only carry ones with antiperspirant.	1
My girlfriend gets tons of facebook messages from guys asking her to do porn or give them sexual favors. Is this normal?	I have my privacy settings on facebook set to only accept messages from people who are on my friends list, and I choose who I "friend" carefully on purpose. If your girlfriend has an exorbitant amount of facebook friends and accepts anyone who send her a request, she's probably going to end up with those kinds of messages. Yeah, they happen, and they're gross, and you don't even have to look like a pornstar. Internet targeting of women is real, and it's everywhere, which is why we need to put up defenses to block those messages before they get sent.	Bruh you need to do some digging in your S/Os history. having your girl get messages like that implies that she's putting something out there in the world that makes the guys think that she would actually accept the offer.	1
Women who look young -- how does it affect you in professional situations?	I get stopped in the halls during class and yelled at. I have people yell "where is your teacher?!" When I'm sitting right there at the teacher's desk. I've had a security guard try and take my phone. I've gotten multiple threats to tow my car for parking in the faculty parking lot. The kids are constantly trying to find out if I party or smoke weed. I'm a high school substitute teacher and I'm 29. (I sub at multiple high schools so security/other teachers don't always recognize me) EDIT: I want to add that I love my job and most of the time I don't get yelled at, I just have gotten yelled at before, for being in the halls during class time before or for sitting at the teachers desk or parking in the faculty lot.	I'm a bartender and most people seem to think I'm 19. I'm actually 24. Customers sometime walk up to me and ask if I'm allowed to work behind the bar and I feel like some customers go easier on me when I screw uop just because they think I'm just a teenager. I kind of don't care that much, but it did annoy me quite a lot at the beginning. I was afraid that people wouldn't take me seriously, but it hasn't been the case so far.	1
For those of you with mental health disorders, what would you like to get off your chest regarding your disorder?	I'd like to point out that Autism and Asperger's syndrome and all of the other lovely things on the spectrum are NOT DISORDERS. Autistics and Aspies are not worth less than normals. So stop implying that - I don't want your pity, I just want you to respect my boundaries.	Just because I have depression does not mean I'm *sad*. Actually I'm more ... nothing. I can't feel, can't care, can't really muster up the energy to have any emotions at all, besides maybe hopelessness at the fact that I can't really feel anything. When the depression is at its worst, being able to feel sadness would be considered an improvement. I hate that depression has the name it does, because in my experience it's so, so much worse than being sad.	0
When you're being private in public, like reading a book alone at a coffee shop, does potential socialization with strangers come with the territory?	I think it's reasonable to expect that another person would be able to read into the fact that you're focused on something and not interrupt you. However, this is not always the case when I've tried to study in public. I've had headphones in while taking notes out of a textbook and had people try and start conversations.	If you're in public, socialization can be expected. However, declining to socialize can also be expected. It's a two way street.	0
Ladies (and gents), do you think its possible to be in a relationship with someone you love, even though the sex is awful or nonexistent?	I see this from time to time: Good sex is 10% of a relationship, bad sex is 90%. Sex is one of the big things that differentiates friendship from a romantic relationship. If it's nonexistent or bad, I would go. But really, I couldn't imagine actually progressing to a serious relationship at all if the sex was bad.	If you are willing to give up sex then I don't think it's impossible. As for "bad sex" I really think there's no such thing as bad sex, just lack of communication! It can be a touchy subject because you don't want to offend the other person or make them feel inadequate or that they don't satisfy you sexually but it's not something that can't be fixed. Personally for me I could not be in a relationship where the sex was bad (and I have been, back when I was younger and embarrassed to bring up the subject!) I don't want to sound like a nympho freak but I love sex too much (with my partner, I am not a crazed slut or anything) I couldn't be in a sexless relationship.	1
Do you guys think the fadeaway/ghosting is a valid way to end a casual relationship?	Of course not. It's a cowardly way to end things. Have the balls to end it face to face like an adult. Give your reasons. Say thanks and goodbye. UNLESS they treated you bad. Then you don't owe 'em anything. Source: The 'fade away' thing was done to me. It sucks.	Might I point out that the truth in breaking up usually doesn't go over very well with women. Among those truths are: * You got too fat (not to fuck, but to be in a long relationship with) * You're too boring (idem) * I don't respect you enough (idem) * I've outgrown you, and can do better than you now * You're only feminist when it's in your favor Imagine, if you will, that every guy who just faded away cared enough about you not to tell you these things in your face. Similar argument holds if sexes are reversed, obviously.	1
Ladies, what do you think of Hillary Clinton?	Just so everyone is aware, we know this is asked a lot, but the question is framed post-convention, which changes the context enough for it to be asked again.

Do women check out men?	Excuse me for commenting in the subreddit, but may I suggest that you start lifting weights and dieting. If you're dedicated by this time next year you will be getting checked out and likely *asked out*. Source: Personal experience. Again, sorry for not being a woman and commenting!	Oh I do it ALL the time. I love looking at men. I just don't make it obvious like you guys do. Question for you: would you *like* for a girl to make it obvious? Edit: the men have spoken! I've decided to make it more obvious when I check guys out. I'll try not to be creepy. ;)	0
Would you like it if your SO sent you flowers at work?	Don't send me anything at work!! I have a professional image to keep up and I don't need to look like a blushing school girl in front of my co-workers. Flowers are PDA (IMO) and should be kept for my private life. Edit: Sorry, thought this was ask women :(	flowers for women at work= physical object meaning SO cares about you flowers for man at work= physical object meaning SO wants to embarrass you.	0
How important are political beliefs to you when trying to find a girlfriend?	So you're saying you want to seize his means of production OP? In any case I don't really care as long as you're not an extremist on either end of the spectrum and can have a discussion about politics without getting mad.	I honestly don't give a fuck about politics, but I could never date a girl that doesn't like guns. Unfortunately, that essentially excludes me from dating 99% of Democrats.	1
People trying to change themselves, what are you "working on"?	Trying to work on my confidence. I know that I am competent but my anxiety is telling me I am not.	I trying to be less sarcastic and making less offensive jokes on my brother (he doesn't like them, but I usually just can't stop myself).	1
I’m wanting to get better at talking to people. How do you hang out at bars on your own?	Don’t. If you have interests find other people in that community through meetups or through stores that cater to your hobbies. That’s the best way. Bars are probably not the answer.	Traveling makes it hard to form a good social circle, so props on giving it a try. My recommendations would be sit at the bar and introduce yourself to the bartender. Explaining your situation, (I'm traveling for work, had to get out of that hotel room, etc) will at least strike up a 3-5 min conversation and plant a seed for more talking throughout the night. If you travel to the same place frequently, make it a point to return to the same place and remember the staff members. If people come to the bar to place rink orders, a simple 'Hey, how's your night going?' will at least illicit a response, and repeating it will increase your chances of actual conversation.	0
What are personality traits in a guy are huge turn-offs for you?	Please feel free to respond about personality trait turn\-offs in the gender\(s\) that you find attractive.

What do you do EVERY Sunday to help prepare you for the week ahead?	Sunday is my relaxation day. I do the chores and other stuff on other days. Sunday I just bake, read a book, watch some fun stuff, maybe use a face mask, don't watch/read the news.	Absolutely nothing and i let my mind wonder to its full extent. Your mind is a sentient being and forcing it to crouch numbers and do other tasks or whatever you do leaves it without its own intellectual needs. I don't need it to remember anything or stress about anything and do what i generally want without outside influences.	1
Men who have had PIV: can I ask you this incredibly gross question?	I don't think that's what you're feeling. But even if it is, no, I've never noticed this in a decade plus of regular sex.	I have never noticed it. The penis, while, of course, sensitive, is not nearly as sensitive as fingers. The only times I have felt a turd in a girl has been when sticking fingers up her butthole.	0
What are things that men do that show they are insecure in their masculinity in your mind?	Thanks to everyone who participated within the rules.

Guys, how do you deal with the feeling that you're constantly "behind" in life?	I don't feel left behind because I own every decision I've made up until this point, even when life throws me curve balls. It's the saying, "hindsight being 20/20." You know you could have done better but with the information that you had, you made the choice that you thought was best and you can't blame yourself for that. I was really depressed about this a year or two ago but I decided there's no use crying over spilled milk, shit happens, and you pick yourself up knowing you're only going to stumble again. It's a matter of mindset.	1. Social media is an emotional cancer. Dump it as much as possible as soon as possible. 2. Stop focusing on what you don't have and start focusing on what you do have.	0
We're encouraged to marry "before all the good ones are gone". In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going?	>In your experience, when did "all the good ones" start really going? Interestingly, "the good ones" didn't even show up until my mid-late twenties.	Lmao at 30+ women who doesn't want to realize their prime is already gone, and most good men are taken.	1
Mothers of AW, what's the last thing your child said/did, that made you say "yup, that's my girl/boy"?	I randomly get Snapchat selfy videos from my daughter with wacky overlay graphics. This causes me to roll my eyes and laugh out loud, which of course is why she does it. She's in her 30's.	It's a weird experience to be a parent. To have this life that you love so much and that pride pours out of you at the littlest experiences. My son is 3 years old and here are a few recent instances: -He wrote his name for the first time! -Watching him do summersaults and balance beam and follow directions at gymnastics class. -He potty trained himself this summer. Pride is something you feel for your children on an almost daily basis, at least when they are young! They are learning and growing so much, that watching them roll over for the first times makes pride swell.	1
What have you done to improve your life lately?	Drinking a lot more water. Now I feel like I have wayyy more energy than always feeling tired all the time and my piss is crystal clear.	NoFap, studying the bible more working out gaming a little less Getting a job and my permit this summer (I'm 16)	1
What are some things that you are trying to improve about yourself right now?	Say out loud when something bothers me, giving more positive feedback to my SO, handling the rejections, defining my feminity while accepting and emphasizing it.	Two main focuses for me right now: 1. Relearning JavaScript and a new framework (react.js) to re-enter the workforce as a web developer after being a stay at home mom for 4 years. I’m nervous at finding a new tech job at 30 but hopeful! 2. Gaining better control over my emotions and strengthening my ability to not take things so personally, but rather learn and grow from criticism. This one has been really difficult.	1
Have you ever given flowers to a man, and if so what was his reaction?	Nope, I find that absolutely pointless. Why should I give someone something that literally dies within a week. I’d rather let it live and give them something they can actually put to use	I recently gave my dad sunflowers for Father’s Day. I expected him to be like “I’m a man, yuck,” but he immediately put them in water, took a bunch of pictures of them, and sent them to all of his friends. It was really sweet.	0
What is a trait that makes you instantly dislike a person you are conversing with?	People who talk at you instead of having a conversation. They only want to be heard and never seek to hear. They can be on a roll pontificating about whatever they are going on about, you can say, "I dress my penis like a tycoon from the 1920s" and they will go on like you haven't said anything. You realize after you have gotten away from them that they probably don't even know your name because they never even cared enough to ask.	When someone stops talking to me to answer their phone, and I can tell they're annoyed at the person for calling. **The sound of a phone ringing does not constitute a requirement to answer**. You can let it go to voicemail and not interrupt our conversation.	1
How often do you think about fucking those around you?	I make this same fucking argument all the time here. FtM transgenders always report this once they start hormone replacement. Yet, everytime I say men and women are different, and that men have a MUCH higher sex drive than women I'm downvoted. To answer your question, yeah pretty much I do.	It happens very often, but it is a fleeting thought. For example, when I walk to work (I work in a city) I will see an attractive woman walking towards me. I will look at her, the thought of her as attractive, sexy, or bang-able passes through my mind, and then its gone. This will happen most times I see a woman, but its a fleeting thought, much like when you see a fancy car. You see it, acknowledge its nice, and then the thought is gone. Very very rarely does the thought progress beyond that or last more than a moment.	0
What is the hottest thing a woman has ever said to you while sexting?	I personally don't like sexting outside of pictures. The whole painting a scenario thing is just incredibly uninteresting to me unless I can actually do what we're talking about right then. Plus it's usually just meaningless words that never actually happen. My idea of sexting is a girl texting me and saying "Hey, do you want a blowjob tonight?" That would turn me on.	Funny thing is, its usually not during sexting. Usually were having a normal conversation and she will send "I really want to suck your cock tonight". The lack of context makes it seem to matter of fact, like sucking my cock is an item on her grocery list. Its surprising and sexy.	0
If your sexually active girlfriend randomly said "No sex before marriage." What would you do?	Lol. Boy you guys are a long way from emotional maturity that will help you last. Why don't you suggest a little third party counseling? If you're serious about her, I've had some counseling that helped my boyfriend and I skip right passed all that nonsense to the real issues. Poor thing is just insecure and young, and heard some stupid BS that made her have unrealistic expectations of you and/or what a loving relationship requires. She just wants to feel the most special. Find a way to show her she is but is expecting to see it in the wrong way. Good luck ;) you kids	I do not miss dating in my early twenties. Edit: does she also get jealous of the idea of you masturbating?	0
How much did you change physically from your High School graduation to your college graduation?	I haven't graduated college yet but I graduated high school a dude and will (hopefully) graduate college as a woman.	When I graduated from high school, I was mistaken for a middle school student. When I graduated from college, I was mistaken for a high school student. That was progress, of a sort.	0
What compliment did you receive that you knew was not true?	Have not had anyone compliment on something that is not true, i am kind of perfect and people don't really complement me enough. My cooking is on par with the world top chefs. My looks are the definition of the golden ration of beauty. My driving skills are better than professional drivers. My personality is a mix of all the saints that have lived. I could brake every world record in any sport if i had the time for it. And i could answer every question science can come up with if i would not be so busy saving damsels in distress from dragons and evil knights.	Bro walked in while i was making dinner. He smiled and said "something smells good"i then showed him all i had done up until then was boil water.	0
Why aren't adult stores more men-friendly?	Female sexuality is seen as a right, natural, and beautiful. Male sexuality is seen as perverted and vile. Thus the sex toy market that uses open shops (as opposed to internet) will be geared towards women, and it will be women working there.	If you're going to judge someone for being a pervert while you work at an adult store then you need to get your head checked.	0
How old are you and what changes in female beauty standards have you seen during your lifetime?	People want big butts now. Butts are the new boobs. Also, for some reason people are obsessed with these big thick eyebrows on women. Makes me want to gag. To me, you look like a man. I like having some hair on my snooch. I shave everything "under", but I like to leave a patch on top. For a while there you couldn't have any hair otherwise there was something wrong with you. I just don't follow any of these rules. I like what I like and that's it.	Eyebrows are the big one to me. I remember in high school, a lot of the girls I knew plucked or waxed their brows down to almost nothing. Then a fuller look came back into vogue and everyone started scrambling, but I know one of my friends had plucked hers down so much they couldn't grow back.	0
What type of guy is definitely not your type?	Off the top of my head--guys who... * smoke *anything* (so, doing drugs is also a big no) * are into men's rights bullshit/not feminists * are racist/sexist/homophobic, etc. * are obsessed with anime/manga/Cosplay/hentai/Japan * have an Asian fetish (ew, ew, EW) * are super religious * fit into the mold of a stereotypical "manly man" * are very politically conservative. I think I could *maybe* be alright with someone who is fiscally conservative, but NEVER someone who is socially conservative, blech * smell funky/bad Edit: Lmfao, some of you seem to think I hate Asians.... I hate people who FETISHIZE Asians, big fucking difference.	'Lad' types. I think it's the UK equivalent of 'bros' basically. Just lots of rude, loud behaviour disguised as 'banter' and lots of unfunny, often misogynist jokes.	0
What is an instant turn off for you?	Hey folks. I'm so very sorry if you find a particular turn-off in here that you don't like or you feel applies to you. Though honestly, the sooner you find out *not every single person wants to date you*, the better off you'll be. Please do not invalidate the people answering the question.

Parents of /r/askmen, if you had the funds to move your immediate family anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?	I wouldn't. I live in a safe neighborhood in a safe city where both my wife and I have stable and good paying jobs, my daughter has all her friends and mentors, and uprooting them all just for some fantasy of living in some exotic locale would be foolish.	Always thought New Zealand seemed nice. Rustic, quiet, and about as far away from the crazy northern hemisphere as you can get. Plus hobbits.	0
To those who sleep separately from your spouse/partner: why &amp; where do you sleep instead?	Other bedroom. He's a heat generator and I have hot flashes. Opposite schedules. Special needs pets, need to be in the same room. I am a terrible sleeper who doesn't work outside the home so I'm the one who finds it easiest to keep the erratic hours.	We sleep in our own separate beds, in separate houses, because neither of us have a job or a car yet and we live 10 miles apart at the moment.	1
How do you prevent losing yourself in a relationship?	Have your man put a GPS tracker on your phone. Then whenever you get lost, ask him to help you.	Those are two different questions, I’ll answer the question in the title. Don’t go into a relationship looking to be “completed” by somebody. It’s important to know and be sure of who you are first and your partner accepts that person instead of having somebody try to mold you into what they want you to be and in turn losing who you really are. Great question!	0
Men who have cheated but were never caught or confessed during the relationship, what are your thoughts and feelings on your infidelity now?	I cheated on my ex a few times. The guilt you feel really eats you up, to be honest. You know you're a bastard for doing it. I regret doing it, I should have broken up with her sooner, and did my own thing. I don't recommend it.	I cheated on my wife and sorry to say but it was pretty great! It was with a coworker in a parked car once every two weeks or so. The anticipation was amazing, made me feel like a teenager again! Once things got normal, we called it quits and I went back to my loving wife! Wins all around!	1
Men of Reddit, what age did you discover that your dream career was not going to happen?	When I turned 6'6", not long after my sixteenth birthday, all my dreams were finally shattered. Still, science was a good second.	You know the funny thing? I have the technical skills to at least attempt my dream job. I just know it's stupid to and isn't worth it. (video game development) Compared to basically any other development job, you get over worked and under paid because of the absurd competition for "doing what you love" I knew going in that it was never going to be more than an idle dream. Especially with how flooded the market has become over the last few years with everyone and their mother thinking they'll make the next hit indie game in their basement and become millionaires.	0
What do other women do that embarrasses you as a woman?	Whenever girls share those "when I say go away is the moment I need you to stay the most" or the more tongue in cheek "women's dictionary" posts or anything like it. I don't think they realize it just makes women seem crazy and unable to convey their thoughts as they are. Please stop trying to make women look complex in a crazy kind of way. It just comes back to bite us in the ass. As a girl who IS very straight forward and have people always bugging me because obviously I mean to say the opposite of what I'm saying, this is VERY annoying.	Well it doesn't *embarrass* me, but as far as "setting us back," I do believe that 92% of married women in 2013 in the U.S. choosing to take their husband's names perpetuates the idea of women being every so slightly less important than men in society.	1
Pet owners in relationships: who do you greet first, your pet or your SO?	Depends who greets me at the door first. Usually it's Luna the cat, because the sound of my car horn usually means I come inside and feed her, but the SO has been there a few times too.	If you have a dog, you don't have a choice in the matter. They make sure to get to you first.	0
How do you differentiate a natural fading of lust in a LTR from an actual and irreparable lack of sexual desire that would be fatal for the relationship?	A big part of it is what the purpose of sex is to you. People who stay in 50 year relationships banging the whole way through dont view sex the same as someone who has had 50 exciting partners. Typically LTR that involve regular, lustful sex uses sex as a tool to reaffirm love/trust/acceptance/forgiveness and other squishy feelings. Exciting sex with new people is a celebration of just how sexy and charismatic you both are by engaging in the greatest feeling in the world. As the hormones and new relationship energy dies away, the need to celebrate this is lessened. That's my view anyways.	Who is teaching people about sex? This isn’t confusing. If you’re not that into her, it ain’t gonna work. People think relationships are about feelings and emotions. No, that’s the icing. Relationships are about sex. And if you’re not that into her, you need to find the one you are. Personality and love do not keep a long term relationship. Every marriage I have seen survive is because they both are very much into each other physically. Lust doesn’t fade. Excitement does.	1
What do you think of this idea that there are "no truly straight women"?	The phrase and idea behind it is super gross. There are plenty of people who have zero attraction to members of their own sex. Sexuality might be a spectrum, but that still means there are people on either end (truly gay and truly straight). *That said,* I'm of the opinion FAR more people (both men and women) are slightly bisexual than what people believe. Generally, I think this is the case because people who prefer the opposite gender would say they're straight even if they occasionally had sexual attraction towards their own gender (which I would consider bisexuality or pansexuality). I feel like the phrase "no truly straight women" exists because women are more likely to admit to feelings of attraction towards their own sex (even if they say they're straight) whereas men have been socially conditioned to avoid that.	It's wishful thinking. I've never had a single urge to do anything sexual with another woman. But people who claim there are "no truly straight women" will argue against that and say I don't know my own feelings or something like that, and it's hard to counter those kind of arguments because it will always come back to "but you don't know your own feelings, you're repressed" or something silly like that. Like a stranger would somehow know me better than I know myself.	0
Do you think girls have a right to be mean and extremely rude just because they are on their period?	No, obviously not. People who are depressed don't have a right to lash out at people if they are hurting, so the relatively minor emotional impact of being on their period certainly isn't to justify it.	if they are irritable and grumpy it's one thing, but if they are downright rude they have no excuse there	0
Non-white women, how do you differentiate (or do you) between someone who is attracted to your ethnicity and someone who is fetishizing you?	I'm white as far as anyone can tell, but I've been stereotyped in certain ways and it's never impressive. It's one thing to like red hair or smooth brown skin or a big ass or devotion to family or a freak in the sheets or w/e. It's another to assume someone will act a certain way because of the way she looks. That's just gross.	When guys tell me they've "never fucked a black girl" or "I wanna see that big, ghetto ass", it's usually a good tip off that a guy is just into me because of my race.	0
How have women tried to pressure you into making a relationship more serious?	Suggesting cohabiting, talking about future kids (I let people know before we date that there won't be kids nor cohabiting). Pushing for me to want more than there is or acting like I'm a git for not wanting more when they do... I've an "ex" (we end out for a couple of months but weren't official) that was long distance. She asks me once, totally casually: "How often do you want to see each other?" Me: Every 3-4 weeks would be fine. HER: THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!!! She gets pissy and we have this weird conversation, and she eventually writes me this letter that includes, "What have we even been doing for the last month?!?" For me, the pressure tends to show up in them getting upset that I'm not where they are emotionally. EDIT: Typos	By being such an amazing, compassionate partner in my life, I couldn't help but want to spend the rest of my life with her. Crafty bitch, using her evil tricks of caring about and supporting me to trick me into giving up being single.	0
What was the most vulnerable an SO has ever been in front of you and how did you comfort them?	He cried hard when his dog died last summer. I held him, stroked his hair, and cried with him. Then I encouraged him to have a little memorial service since I read an article once about how pet deaths can be hard because we don't deem it as societally-acceptable to grieve for them, even if they feel like family. I didn't want him to bottle it up, so we had a little vigil where he told me stories about his dog and we honored her memory.	I wonder why there are no stories about a guy being vulnerable and then a woman losing attraction in this subreddit/thread. Hmm. Could it be that women are wonderful?	1
Do you talk about other women while in a relationship?	Its crude, but what men are really saying is: *I find her attractive enough, that if my circumstances were different, and she agreed, we would proceed to a physical relationship*	I also think talking like that is crude, disrespectful, and breeds idolization outside of your relationship which IMHO is unhealthy. ***But*** I have always felt like a statistical outlier in this regard as I know many, many other men who do. For reference I'm a 27M in a 3+ year relationship. I will tell my SO if I think a female is attractive but the thought of banging anyone else is repulsive.	1
What seemingly inconsequential thing did someone say or do to you that really messed you up in some way?	Mine is sort of a recurring one, but my older sister is legally blind, and every time I try to talk to my mom about any kind of problem in my life, she says "Just think how much harder life is for your sister!" It's made me feel guilty about feeling upset about my problems, and it's also really made me resent my sister, which isn't fair to her because she would never say anything like that. My mom always says that she's just trying to give me some perspective and that it shouldn't bother me so much, but it feels like nothing going on in my life is significant enough to matter to her.	when i was about six years old a girl in my gymnastics class told me i was the ugliest girl in the class. i didnt realize it until years later, but that was the start of my insecurities. also, a few years ago my best friend made a comment about how i run, and now i try to avoid running in front of people because of it.	1
Can I see pictures of your pets, please?	Users are reminded that by sharing a picture with the community, they potentially lose all control over what happens to that picture and what other users do in response to that picture. In the past, we have had issues with: * Stalking/Harassment * A user writing a script to scrape the thread and attach pictures to user names at a later date * Doxxing * Unwelcome private messages Post at your own risk! No life guards in the pool!

What's one thing you never expected people to find attractive about you (but they do)?	My fucking face lips. Everyone, male or female, comments on my lips. Am I wearing lipstick? Am I wearing gloss? No. I've never in my life worn those and my lips look plain to me, but everyone raves about them. It annoys me for some reason.	I have a *huge* crooked nose. An older German lady stopped me once and told me that I had the most beautiful profile and that my nose was a gift. I had to hold back my laughter but I did thank her. I always thought it was the weirdest thing. I don't think she was lying either because she was this tiny older lady with a thick accent and she seemed really sweet. I've always been made fun of for my nose so for even one person out there to say it was beautiful was so very weird to me.	0
Queer women, what do straight people not understand?	Coming out, and how it's not just a one time 'I'M OUT' party. It's over and over and over again with everyone you meet and sometimes more than once with people you have met. Heterosexuality is a hegemony in our society and it *sucks*.	I've generally not have had issues with straight people. I've had issues with jackasses, but those are everywhere. I feel that this topic is assuming a divide that, like that, is only existing in the heads of a vast minority. Well. Opinions.	1
What was life like before & after you got medication for your mental illness?	I have a good friend who is definitely the most angry hard to get along with person I know. Recently started taking some type of medication and is a completely different person. I do worry about the medication numbing the deep issues but for the current moment she's enjoyable to be around.	I feel like my meds (Prozac) reduced my symptoms by around 30 percent. Now I have the energy to do therapy, CBT, make positive changes in my life etc so then I expect that as I do those things, the symptoms will reduce further. I'm on Prozac. It really helped my mind get quieter. All of a sudden I had room in my brain to think of better things.	0
What is the dumbest thing your SO has been mad or annoyed at you for?	One of my exes got pissed at me for going on vacation with my family for ten days. It was my birthday present and they offered to pay for him and get us our own room and everything, but he said no. He called me and yelled at me several times and finally I broke up with him a week into the trip.	A few responses from my husband. I got a ticket on my way home from a friends house while he was deployed, I told him and he wrote back "You can even be trusted!" Uh... trusted? With what? Following the rules of the road? Obviously we know that! I got a ticket! Recently he's out to sea again and last week I fell while holding my open new macbook pro, the screen cracked in a few places. "I'm never ever buying you a new laptop ever again. And I'm not paying to get it fixed" :O That was a bit extreme. "Don't feed the cat with those small plates, we use those!" Should I not wash the kitties bowls with the same dish sponge either?	1
What should everyone know about partying?	The usual guideline for buying drinks for a party is to reserve two drinks per person for the first hour, and one drink per person for every hour after that. That's a good baseline, if you don't know your tolerances. I also like to stop drinking at least ten hours before I plan to wake up, and go to bed with an ibuprofen, to prevent hangovers.	Drink but know your limits. After the evening drink at least 5 cups of water, maybe more since hangover is not really fun. When you dance just don't give a shit about what you look like, imagine you are in an empty room, like another poster said focus on having fun not looking like you are having fun.	0
What has been your most disillusioning life experience as a man?	I was in Amsterdam with a group of Jewish friends. We went to an improv comedy show that was in English. The actors on stage asked the audience for "Funny confessions" that they could act out on stage. One guy yells out, "I killed a thousand Jews!!!". The audience laughed! The actors actually went through with it and turned it into some sort of Hitler/Holocaust joke. We got up and walked out. It was the first time in my life I really, truly understood how many otherwise civilized people out there hate me for literally no reason other than being born.	Getting out of the military and realizing how little America cares about its veterans. I don't just mean the shittiness of the VA. When you go look for a job, they'll ask you if you have any 'real experience' (apparently leading 40 men with $10 million worth of equipment into combat isn't quite as important as being an intern).	0
Women of Reddit how do you get rid of guys who don't take ' No' as an answer?	I get really, really gross. One dude at a bar didn't take no for an answer. I was drunk so when he said, "I got a pocket full of condoms." I blurted back, "And I've got a pussy full of blood." He actually physically retched and walked away while I cackled.	If you say “No” and the person won’t accept it, it is not your business to make them happy. Walk away. The reason people refuse to accept No for an answer, is because that want you to change your No into Maybe, and finally a Yes. The problem is, your initial/right/true/intuitive response was No, and they failed to respect it. The problem lies with them, not with you. Those who know no boundaries, no honor, no respect are really good at letting a No fly over their head, and continue to insist to get their way. Psychos are especially skilled at that. Just ask any victim of violence. And that’s why it’s not your responsibility nor obligation to deal with such people. There are a lot of respectful people in the world who’d enjoy your company and be honored by your presence.	1
What's the worst lie anyone has ever told you?	There are too many to choose from with my dad. "I did check with you about the funeral date, don't you remember?" "I did visit you in the hospital. I brought you lunch. You don't remember?" "I was never unfaithful to your mother." "I can't pay for school supplies for you. Your mother has all my money." "I treat you this way because I love you more than your brother." He's a pathological gas-lighter. It doesn't fuck me up as much now as it did when I was a kid.	I'm a guy but: "I'll wait for you" after I went to do my conscription. Turned out she had another guy a month in. She even tried to get back together with me saying: "After you told me you were wounded, I thought you would die, I can't wait forever." "I called you and told you I wanted to see you in the hospital, and that it was a bullet to the arm ffs!"	1
How is your start to the week?	My SO is sick. These past couple weeks had been crazy and expensive, and we're also moving next week. I started feeling a tingle in my throat and gargled salt water and it's not feeling too bad today? Hopefully it goes away.	My life is pointless and the start of my week has been no different. This morning I woke up a half hour before my alarm went off and my dog noticed. I guess he was cold because he crawled on me and fell asleep on my stomach/chest and then we slept like that the last half hour. So I guess something good happened.	0
My boyfriend says I don't understand the subtle aggression between men when they don't know one another but are in conflict/competition for something. Is there a whole other meta game that I'm unaware of governing how men react with one another?	I don't know how old you guys are, but to me he sounds like a teenager trying to look tough. Sure, anyone can escalate to violence when necessary, but not for something as trivial as a shoulder bump in the street.	Is nobody going to mention the fact that they casually bumped into each other and then the girl immediately started talking about how they were out celebrating her new job having a few drinks? Honestly this stranger doesn't really give a shit about that.	0
Does anyone else ever feel "responsible" if their friends aren't having fun at something they chose to do/didn't like the food at a restaurant they chose, etc?	No, not really. Not everyone is going to like the same stuff. I'd apologize, suggest we could do something else, or insist that they choose the next activity/food place/whatever.	Part of me knows I shouldn't take it so personally. The other part of me thinks they should know it is rude and not complain about an activity I chose. Worse than friends, my ex used to do this. Ugh. He complained about my indecisiveness and complained when I did choose a place. Ass hole.	0
How many bowls of cereal is too many?	For me, it's one. A single bowl is all it takes to open Pandora's Box and I awaken in a stupor surrounded by empty boxes of cheerios. I love cereal too much and I cannot be trusted alone with it, so not even once.	Honestly, 1 is too much. Cereal is what I like to call human dog food, it just makes you fat. It's nutritionally worthless and you'd better off eating bacon and eggs.	1
What was the worst betrayal you have experienced from a non-romantic relationship?	Found out my best friend was going to spend New year's Eve with her another friend instead of me and it did hurt me a lot, because it was the last New year's Eve I was spending in the city we lived in together before moving away. And what did hurt even more was that she didn't see what's the problem. It was 7 years ago, today we're actually not friends anymore and she sometimes asks and wonders what's happened - well, if she wasn't such a shitty friend and didn't disappoint me like hundred times, then we would still be friends. Some people are not worth your friendship.	My parents repeatedly created situations where my mom would have to choose between my dad and her kids and she always, always chose my dad. Memorable examples include when my mom kicked us all out of the house (ages 16, 15, and two two-year-olds) because the toddlers were crying and she didn't want dad to hear it, and another recently when she told my sister to keep quiet about being sexually assaulted by our brother in law because my dad thinks it was a one-time mistake and there's no use in hurting our other sister.	0
What's a good mix dresses, skirts, blouses, slacks, jeans and tees for a girl going into the 4th grade?	Let her pick out her own clothes. Strangers like us cant know her style, she might not even want skirts.	I would say more casual stuff like jeans and t-shirts. A few nice special occasion outfits. If she likes to wear dresses and skirts, then more of those. Definitely a good pair of sneakers. At 9 years old, she will be able to tell you what she likes, and as an adult you know what is practical. I work in an elementary school and I would say most 4th grade girls wear a mix of jeans/shorts and skirts with cute t-shirts and sweaters. A few very athletic girls wore mostly track suit type pants and t-shirts. Let her pick her outfits within reason but make sure to get a variety :)	0
Has anyone heard of the term "starter wife"? Is it a thing that actually happens?	I know a few women who were starter wives. I feel pretty bad for them because, as far as I can tell, their main offense was growing old.	I WAS A STARTER GIRLFRIEND. I didn't know it was a thing, omg. It makes sense. I MADE HIM. He was a super shy, useless virgin when I met him. Could barely talk to his own family shy. Never had a job or made himself useful at all. I got him his first car, I kept it maintained, made appointments, got his car insurance, made him amazing in bed, got him a job, got him in school, helped him with his second job, organized the buying of our house, took care of WVERYTHING. Got him his new car, helped him make a savings account and then 'I'm moving out don't love you bye'. FOR A YOUNGER GIRL. I FEEL BETTER.	1
What has been the most misogynistic thing you have experienced?	I was on the elliptical at the gym I used to go to. It was a very small community college gym - 3 treadmills, an elliptical, a bike, and one TV. I was the only person working out and there was a Yankees game on the TV. I love the Yankees - even spent my honeymoon at the Baseball Hall of Fame. So I was actually *watching* the game. A guy walked in and asked if he could change the station. I said no, I'm watching the game. He then said "yeah, right". I said "I'm a Yankees fan". He made a noise like "pfft" and said "ok, then name off all the players". I said ok and started naming off my favorites first - he interrupted me and said "those are just the *popular* players" and walked away.	Anytime I tell someone I'm not interested in marriage or children, they said you will give it time. No I'm pretty sure I won't be changing my mind now or ever	1
Redditors who have completely start over in their late 30's, what did you do? How has your life changed?	I waited until I was 41 to flip the table. I left my 19 year marriage and started over in a new town where I had just a few friends. Lived there during the divorce process, but never really found my feet, and ended up moving to ANOTHER new town in response to a job offer. That was a place where I knew no one, and moved with just a tiny trailer load of stuff. That was 8 years ago. I've had to learn how to date as an adult, establish a career from scratch, make friends, collect enough stuff to fill an apartment, and figure out who I am as a single person. And I've done pretty well, honestly. My life now is a good one.	What does this question even mean? Start over? You don’t start life over, you begin new chapters. This is exactly what is wrong with society & never being satisfied. Self love and acceptance is vitally important in life..don’t think in terms of being late to the party or missing an opportunity. It’s all about growth and self acceptance. Namaste.	1
What's something obviously designed without the input of any women?	Girly versions of things. There are sometimes practical considerations like making things smaller, or easier to reach, or lighter.. but never pinker. And they're so, so often pinker. Pink hammers, pink drills, pink golf clubs, pink sports jerseys (so no one can tell who you support from a distance), I'm pretty sure no one ever asked for these things to be the *only available colour* most of the time.	Jars. And soda bottles. Can't we really come up with something with more grip to make it easier to open without requiring a boyfriend? Damnit!	1
I have never dated a guy who expected me to pay for anything. Am I just lucky or is this the norm?	You haven't met me. Any indication that you expect me to pay for you and you're out the door. It's curious that I've been actually called a sexist in real life when admitting that I'd never pay for a woman on a date.	My coworker is paying all of the rent for him and his girlfriend, at $1400 a month. Poor bastard. I think it's more common for the guy to pay for everything in cases where he makes good money and she doesn't. Outside of that case, it's a lot more even I think. It's typically a realistic assessment of what makes sense financially for both people.	0
Is "I'm only friends with guys because girls are too much drama," actually a thing?	Every girl I've met who has said this fit into one or both of these categories: * *She* is the actual catalyst of drama with other women * She has a flirtationship with most of the guys she's friends with	I went to an all-girl's catholic high school and had a horrible time of bullying, rumors and exclusion, and so I sort of developed this mentality because, in fact, the few friends I had were guys. Now that I'm an adult I've realized this was completely circumstantial and would never even think of saying this, let alone believe it. All it took was a few good female friends after graduation to teach me that not all women are cruel high school girls.	0

How have you been fortunate in life?	My dad work expat. I look after the house for him, but in reality I live there rent free and just cover running costs.	My parents were 1st generation immigrants. My mother, at one point, literally lived in the jungle and my dad grew up in a European orphanage. I was able to get a good education, and an interesting career partly from the values they instilled in me. My wife is beautiful, and came with ... financial benefits (there's no way around it, it has added to my quality of life). We are financially stable, with my only debt being an investment property I bought before getting married. We have a beautiful 2 year old girl, who randomly hugs me and tells me she loves me. We are contemplating a second. I'm living in a goddamned dream and I don't want to wake up.	0
What was your worst first date like?	Ran into my old grade school crush when we both attended the same college. Turns out she'd had a crush on me in grade school too. First date we were going to the mall to see a movie and do some shopping. Something came up and we had to skip the movie. Then we bought baby mice to feed her snakes, which was kind of weird. We went back to my place, made out for a bit, but she had to run home before her mice thawed out. And then, she ghosted on me. Which was pretty hard considering we had classes in the same building and she lived two houses down from my parents.	I saw one on another worst date thread but this guy was driving the girl home after the date and she says ooooo what's this proceds to pull emergency brake on the freeway.	1
Attractive men of reddit who are dating a girl who is not considered attractive what’s your take on it?	I and a few of my friends have dated non-attractive girls before. Usually we were in a dry spell and needed to get out of the funk, but sometimes it was because less attractive girls put out easier and are lower maintenance. And for some my friends, they're hot but have no game so they have to settle for less.	I've often dated women who are not conventionally attractive. At the same time, you'd be surprised how malleable people's views of beauty are. If you treat someone who is beautiful on the inside as though they are beautiful on the outside, they start to see themselves that way, and so do other people. Obviously there are limits to this, but I'll take the confident yet goofy girl with a big heart, over the hot girl with no depth and high expectations, any day.	0
Women who started their relationship as "the other woman"- does it ever cross your mind that your partner will find another "other woman" when committed to you? How do you stop your mind from wandering?	I started out my last relationship as the other woman and the trust that I had for him was so low from the start. We were with each other all the time and constantly keeping tabs on one another when we weren't together. I made no time for my friends and isolated myself from everything. I went from being confident and happy to embarrassingly insecure in myself and my relationship. So if you're thinking about it, just don't do it. There's so many other people out there and you should absolutely consider starting a relationship where you can trust the other person entirely because how it all started will always be in the back of your head.	I'm a man. This is the original starting reason that I've always been alone, still, at 33. I didn't want to ask a girl out if I felt there might be a chance that I would meet someone better while with her, and have to betray her in order to leave, and the other girl would know, and so how would she ever trust me? This, along with awkwardness, led me to never having had a girlfriend by my mid twenties, and after about that time, no woman wants a man that has no relationship experience, and so I missed my window. There are other things wrong with me too that I've tried to fix, but it's really too late now.	1
What unrealistic expectations do young men have about women?	That our vaginas will smell like fresh flowers and clean laundry or whatever. I mean, it shouldn't smell *bad*, or fishy, but it DOES have a smell, and it is NOT like mangoes or cotton candy or whatever they fuck they seem to think it should smell like. Also, like a lot of other posters in this thread, I feel like a lot of the boys I dated in high school were way too horrified about periods, body hair, and other natural functions of the female body. They seemed to not want to acknowledge that girls are just people.	Some young men expect you to be their mommyyyyyyyyyt:c mommyyyy where are you mommyyyy. Go die I am not such a thing. If anything I'm more like your bitter old grandfather. Bye	1
What do I do if my friend's girlfriend dislikes me???	My best friend is female. My girlfriend has no problem with me being so close with her, but if she ever did I would choose my friend over my girlfriend. Your friend might not feel the same way though. Just be the bigger person and treat her better than she treats you. If she acts petty and you behave normally and your friend still chooses her over you, then he wasn't a friend worth having anyways.	Do you ever hang out with him and her? Maybe you should try to make friends with her by doing things together or something like a double date. That ways she'll see the nature of your friendship and might not worry as much.	0
Women with IUDs: yay or nay?	I have mirena. My sex drive went way up, my periods are usually light, and for the most part I can't even tell it's there. However, it caused me to break out around my chin (never had problems with acne while not on birth control or on the pill). I occasionally get pretty bad cramps that seem to come out of nowhere. It probably needs adjusted. And doggy style feels like he's falcon punching my uterus, usually.	Skyla checking in! Was on oral contraception for a few years about 4 years ago. Was without since. Tried Nuvaring on doctors rec and it was the worst month ever! Went with Skyla iud once the issues were treated, and I've had it for a few months. The insertion was very uncomfortable but not painful or scary. The cramps were quite bad here and there for 2 days. Spotting pretty consistent but getting better. Period lighter and easier, diminished pms symptoms which is good. And I'm losing weight, have great skin, and all the things that made oral BC and Nuvaring not work for me aren't a problem with the iud! PLUS I still have a good sex drive. Yay!	1
How Do Men Feel Love?	1. I lose weight. Particularly around the wallet area. 2. I wonder where said weight loss is going. 3. I put weight back on.	Might be a weird answer but being in love makes me feel completely and totally vulnerable. And it’s a vulnerability that for once, I’m okay with.	0
What's the worst thing an ex-partner has said about having sex with you?	Guy here. I just wanted to say, you ladies shouldn't let a moron's words/insults or whatever get to you. you'll find someone much better that deserves you and anything you have to offer. sincerely, every non horrible guy	This happened while I was still seeing him: a couple of months after we lost our virginity to each other, my ex told me that I needed to lose a lot of weight because he "deserved to have sex with a woman who had a great body".	0
Are you ok with your SO talking/texting with her ex? What if you found out she was doing it and didn't tell you?	I don't care. People have friends, and for some people, that includes someone they dated. She's with me and not her ex because she wants to be with me and not her ex.	There are not many good reasons why you still need to be in contact with your ex. If she somehow has good reasons and informs me of them, fine. If she's been doing it behind my back, not fine.	0
How do I tell my girlfriend that her screaming during sex is a huge turn off?	Invest in a ball gag. Tell her its so you can spice up your love life. But you'll know what it's for.	Loud girls usually have it a turn off to not be loud. She might like the pillow trick or the ball gag, never hurts to explain your preferences and propose to explore solutions. But it looks like you two have incompatible sexuality.	1
how to tell your GF you don't really care about a certain thing she constantly talks about?	Some women are just like this. They are always talking (usually about themselves) and don't like having silence or quiet moments together. Just tell her you think its great she is interested in those things but you are not and would prefer to talk about other things. If she continues after that and just keeps talking at you then your other option is to just tune her out. That or leave.	I made a sign saying “for the love of Christ, please change the subject”. It wasn’t helpful at all. Don’t do this.	0
What’s a self care thing you do that you swear by?	Don’t have small children. Reading through the top comments I don’t have time for showers clean sheets and brushing my teeth. One day I will but not now.	I made changing my sheets a happy event thing. Each Monday I change my sheets and do a pamper evening thing, with a facemask, a longgg shower with scrub, loads of lotions after. Have a nice drink,maybe do yoga. Then when I'm at the cleanest I'll ever be, I'll grab a fresh pair of pj's and go to bed early to enjoy some shows in my little cocoon of perfect.	0
What's that small thing that people do that you really appreciate?	When we lived together, my SO would leave for work before me. I rode my bicycle to work. When I went downstairs, I'd find my bike turned around so I could walk it out the door instead of having to back it up because of the way I entered the day before. He would do all sorts of sweet things like that. We've been super long distance (Japan and US) since March after being inseparable for three years. Looking forward to reuniting in about three weeks!	Pretty much everything my SO does. He's extremely caring and always makes sure I'm taken care of. A few of the more recent ones are he went out of his way to buy me a heating pad, pain pills, and pads to leave at his place whenever I'm on my period. When I'm sick he also always makes sure I'm stocked up on cough drops, soup and medicine. I was also really sick one day and I pretty much slept all day/night. He made sure I stayed hydrated, woke me up to feed me and give me my meds on time and made sure I was warm. God I love that guy.	1
Have you ever slept with a man who you knew was taken?	I have. It was a drunken hookup, and he was in an LDR with no end date. Neither of those things makes it okay, but those were the reasons I used to rationalize it at the time. I feel bad, but they're still together, so I guess they worked it out. On a broader level, I believe that both parties should claim responsibility for their actions, but the person with the SO has broken the trust in their relationship, whereas the other man/woman doesn't have that kind of obligation beyond the implications for their own moral compass.	No, and I would never. Knowingly helping someone cheat is despicable, and they're as much to blame as the cheater themselves.	1
Ladies, has a man ever gotten angry/hostile toward you after you've (politely) turned him down?	Yes. Constantly. Do you want a 'wider, more diverse group' to express their experiences or to express the answer you want? I read your post as 'i don't like/believe what the women on my facebook said, so i'll ask here to get a different response" Which is messed up. Accept what those women told you. I really hope I'm wrong and misreading this though. oh well.	Yes, at my bachelorette party. I refused all the drinks he brought me and then he got angry and shoved me when I refused him sex. I had the bride-to-be sash on and everything. He said I owed him sex for all the drinks he had bought, the bouncer literally threw him out of the bar. When we had to leave because the bar was closing (it was about an hour later), the bouncer also checked to make sure he wasn't just hanging out waiting for us.	0
Those who watch Bob's Burgers -- are you Bob, Linda, Tina, Louise, or Gene and why?	I'm a weird combination of Tina and Louise. A little socially awkward, a little sadistic. I have a friend who is literally Bob. It's weird but amazing. He was even Bob for Halloween last year	I am a super Louise, right down to slapping the perfect faces of people I like and resent for making me like them.	1
How do I stop/prevent being boring?	Listen to people and ask them questions about what they are telling you. Ask them about them. People like talking about themselves more than anything. They'll talk about themselves for an hour and think YOU'RE interesting. Edit: Fixed your/you're	You're not necessarily boring. You're just an introvert. Also consider that the other person may be the boring one since the two of you clearly have nothing to talk about.	1
Dear men, what’s the difference between the non-verbal downwards head nod and the upwards one?	I nod quickly down and back up to signal everythings okay, like when turning water on to a new sink, it means no leaks, its good. If i nod up it means fuck waters going everywhere and its usually occomoanied by a random short vocalization of frustration	Upwards: What's up man? How you doing? Acknowledgement of our knowing each other. Invitation to start talking. Downward: Acknowledgment of respect, agreement, understanding and/or wariness of each other or the situation at hand. EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards, I appreciate them greatly. And I'm glad we apparently have a near-universal form of communication.	0
What’s the longest it has taken you to get over someone?	Just a couple of days, really. The only frustrating part is that I still haven’t found a rebound girl yet. E: why is this getting downvoted?	Fair warning: Don't read these comments if you just got dumped and want some assurance that everything will be OK.	0
How many women who've had abortions would still have found a way to have one even if they were illegal?	This question is like many other times I have thought of women in the past. I would have done whatever I needed to do to make it happen. I would have been locked up and key tossed away, I would have been such the troubled maker. I only know this because I'm getting in trouble in this day and age! As my Doctor was telling me a semi no on something I was thinking to myself, Uhg, I hate being a good person because I could so get what I want by this way or that. Really though, I'm not a good person, I just happen to fear prison.	Maybe only the poorest women wouldn't, in my opinion, find a way. And even then, those women might try the most unsafe and harmful of options. If it were illegal for me to get an abortion, I have money that can pay for travel and a discreet doctor. If I didn't have money, I would harm myself and use known household methods. If that failed, I'd do anything to get myself beaten up and hope that would do it. There's always a way, and it depends on how much info you can get and how brave (I guess that's not the best word?) you are to go through with using the particular method.	0
Is your wife taking your last name important to you?	Well she took her ex's last name when they were married, so I'd be a little perplexed if she wouldn't take mine.	Yes. The entire institution of marriage is based on the tradition of formalizing your relationship. If a woman would not take my name, I would not marry her - simple as that.	1
Do men get scared walking home alone at night, too?	I get jumpy in bad areas. My response is closer to extreme wariness instead of just fear. I start checking corners as a approach them, checking my six frequently, keeping an eye out for escape routes if I need to bolt. Situation awareness is comforting.	It would be stupid for anyone not to be scared about walking home alone at night, especially depending on the area you live in. But at the same time, there's this prevailing idea that women should always be *really* scared when they're alone. Not just when it's dark or late or if they're in a bad area, but everywhere. It makes all women a lot more afraid than they should be. Especially when you consider that men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime.	1
What are your most fun at home date ideas?	We make popcorn before a movie on the couch..... Then we cuddle a lot because our new couch is awesome. Also my new blanket is awesome. The cats are not awesome, though, and try to lay on the blanket.	Learn a skill or do a craft together. My fiancé and I aren’t terribly artistically inclined, but we like to go to craft stores and get packaged projects to do. We made a mosaic stepping stone, painted coffee cups, and etched beer mugs and wine glasses. I taught him how to crochet once, and we both tried sewing together.	0
What are some social situations were you would rather want to be treated like a person of the opposite sex?	Treated as if I were a woman or for women to act towards me the way men act towards women?	Moving day. Would be great if all my female friends who are secretly hoping to hookup with me would come out of the woodwork and help me move furniture.	0
How do you spoil yourself?	For my last few birthdays I've taken the day off of work, stayed in bed reading until about noon, ordered tons of sashimi (take out, so I don't have to change out of pajamas and I barely have to talk to anyone), and played video games/watched Netflix until my husband came home to take me out to dinner.	I sit in a gorgeous local hipster cafe (there are a few to choose from) and slowly drink an iced black coffee while making lists on my phone or otherwise musing/planning about my future. The one nearest my house serves me the iced black coffee in a tall milkshake glass with a straw. I can close my eyes and pretend it's a milkshake :-/ (I decided to not drink coffee or other non-alcoholic drinks with any calories in them any more over the last month, to help me ease into a lower-sugar lifestyle. Alcoholic drinks are still fine though - wine, beer, alcoholic milkshakes even. I make the rules!) (It's a damn shame, because the aforesaid cafe makes an excellent donut-&-espresso milkshake with extra donut on top. I had it once before I made the Rule, it was so good.)	1
A girl pulls the 'ol "Did I leave my earrings at your place?" trick but you don't want to see her again. How do you get out of this?	Drop them off at her work, while she's working, to the receptionist. God forbid they were her deceased grandmother's, but you know how luck would have it.	"Those were yours? I'm sorry, I gave them to . . . someone else . . . I could call her and ask for them back - I'm sure she didn't mean to. . .(click)."	1
What are your favourite uses for coconut oil?	I add it to my coffee! It's better if you blend it (it's more frothy) or you can just drop a teaspoon in hot coffee, it'll melt at room temp. The first time I tried it I couldn't figure out how I had spent five hours cleaning the entire house and still had a ton of energy. After doing some research, it turns out that it's great for your metabolism - helps break down bad fats and boosts energy levels.	I'm a guy but I stumbled in... I use it as an aftershave and never have razor burn or razor bumps with it. That may help a few of you... I'm leaving now...	0
What are your thoughts on the Harvey Weinstein controversy?	I'm sad but not shocked. The casting couch thing in Hollywood isn't a new thing. Hopefully people who have been effected can find closure now.	He's a piece of shit, but for every girl he sexually assaulted there's 10 who willingly sucked his dick in exchange for a movie part and knew exactly what they were doing and did it willingly. Some of those same women will come out and say it was non-consensual too. This shouldn't really be news for anyone, Hollywood is an incredibly promiscuous and vice filled industry that is overflowing with hypocrisy around every issue they pretend to champion. I'd be willing to bet that Weinstein isn't even the worst offender and more will be coming out. Also I'd be willing to bet that some sick kiddo pedophile shit will come out of this somehow, Weinstein or not.	1
Men with small penises, how has it affected your self esteem and your sex life?	In all honesty, the only thing you can do is to bang him so much that his dick gets sore. He's not going to get over it by you being empathetic because once you say "Oh it's fine," then he knows how bad the situation really is. Just keep demanding sex from him and get him to a point where he knows you're enjoying it because you keep wanting it.	This is a little off topic, but I've been with men who are 7 inches and were still self conscious about their size. I felt bad that they felt that way.	1
I, 21M, was just sexually assaulted at a club for the first time and am furious. Can't believe you ladies deal with this constantly - how do you do it?	I'm a lady. I don't deal with this constantly. No, I'm not ugly. Just wanted to point out that not all women are harassed constantly.	The British TV station Channel 4 commissioned a small study for its *Dispatches* program in 1995. Of the 81 cases of male sexual victimization that they looked at -- 60 of which were penetrative rapes, and 21 sexual assaults of some other kind -- the *least* common response among male victims, at 17%, was physical resistance. 23% tried to talk their way out of the situation. 60% froze, reacting neither physically or verbally. It's almost the default response, for both sexes, in these kinds of situations.	0
What should you know/do when your mom is dying from cancer?	Record her voice bc u will miss it. Hold her hand and never forget how soft it is. Tell her what a wonderful mom shes been. Spend as much time as possible with her bc these r moments u will never get back and if u dont u will regret it. My mom only lived 6 weeks from diagnosis to her death. I put my entire life on hold. I fell behind on my Bill's, took off from my job, whatever I had to do to be with her and I'd do it all over again a million times. When she drew her last breath my whole family was by her side and it was truly a beautiful site bc my Mom was the best there ever was and I knew heaven was next for her.

Single ladies, what was your last dating/sex disappointment?	This guy tried so hard to get me to go out with him for about a month. I finally gave in and after 3 dates or so, he had started to win me over. On date 6, I told him so and then he confessed that he was still getting over his last girlfriend and thought I could help him get over her since I "looked" like her!!! So creeped out and angry because of the time wasted.	A guy who didn't measure up to my penis size criteria. Kind of sucked to get naked and see him lacking for me. I bailed before anything else happened. Though I was able to score another guy for the night.	1
Is the latest crop of young female stars particularly baby-faced or am I just getting old?	I think it's a common theme with petite girls, I can never tell how fucking old they are most of the time. She could be 16 or 27 only the god of many faces knows.	I've thought the same thing about those two. I'm a dude and I just can't see Ariana Grande as a sex object.	1
Why do girls treat guys better if he is with another girl?	Pre-selection. The fact that you've been "accepted" (they don't know she's your sister) by other women can make a woman see you in a better light. Many married men can tell you how their ring can get many women going, and it's not because of some specific will to break up a relationship. Men with ample options with women, men with success with women, even men who just give off the vibe of success, they're simply the ones who'll be particularly attractive to other women. Extra edit: this isn't only sexual, either.	My wife says that women are naturally "catty" with other women, so when there is a male involved they use him as a "buffer" to play the situation out till both women are comfortable with eachother.	1
How would you feel if your SO refused to buy tampons/pads for you?	I never understood why guys were so weird about buying tampons. As a cashier the only thing I'm thinking is that maybe you should grab some M&M's while you're at it 😂	I would buy my own because why couldn't I in the first place? That's not his responsibility, it's mine. And if he's uncomfortable with it, I wouldn't blame him. Periods are the worst and it's gross. But first of all, rule #1 always stay over stocked on tampons/ pads. Rookie mistake.	1
Have you ever received advice about romance or sex that made you a little sad for the person giving it? What was the advice and what did you find sad about it?	From a very, very religious friend in high school: "You don't have sex for *pleasure!*" It just made me feel super sad because she made it clear that she expected her lot in life to be getting married, staying home, and having as many kids as possible. And that's cool if that's your jam, son! The thing that made me sad was that she viewed it as her Sacred and Irrefutable Biological Duty to lie there and think of England so she could have oodles of kids because "there aren't enough [insert her religious group]s in the world!"	A lot of comments on AskMen make me...sad. Not that they're sexist and it's not against the commenters individually but so many men seem to see relationships as somewhat...transactional? Obligations to be met, rules to follow. It makes me sad because of a society that makes them think it had to be like that - is the opposite of how I view relationships, which is based on trust, love and partnership. There's nothing specific or glaring but they talk about women as if it's a 1+1=2 kind of thing, it's completely different to how I see women talk about men on here. Does anyone else know what I mean (and can maybe explain it better than me haha)?	1
I don't trust her anymore... how to let her down easy?	> Not posting this on /r/relationships[1] because let's face it - /r/relationships[2] is shit, and also I'm banned from there. lol "and also I'm banned from there." it is shit though.	You couldn't even be bothered to give your fiance a call to break up with her? Did you really do it over fucking FB messenger? Really?	1
Ladies,how has your SO comforted you in a time of need?	He will do my dishes (we don't live together) or cook a meal if he senses I'm stressed. One night, his parents both made some rude comments while I was over, and he took me out for pizza and beer just to get out and be away from a situation that was making me uncomfortable. Honestly, just time together, rubbing my back or my hair, is very soothing to me.	I really appreciate: 1. My husband taking care of practical things so I have less to worry about. 2. Little gifts like a nice notepad or a magazine. 3. Asking if I want a hug. What *doesn't* help: 1. Useless platitudes like "everything happens for a reason". 2. Being told that there's always someone worse off than you. I am not that someone else, I am me and this is my stuff and if it's hurting then it's hurting. 3. Trying to give me solutions if I don't want them.	0
Bisexual women of Reddit, what are some notable differences between being in a relationship with a man and a woman? What about sex?	Every comment is basically saying dating women is better.. so maybe y'all are actually just gay? I don't see why you'd date men at all if you prefer to date women. But I guess the followup question is what do you like about men or dating men that makes you confident that you're bisexual and not just gay?	I feel more cared for by women. Though maybe it's just the men I've dated. For me, men are more likely to do some kind of grand gesture like buy a really nice present on your birthday, and consider "romantic box ticked" for a while. But women will send you that text before that presentation you're really nervous about, or say they found that one thing that you were talking about doing for a while...just generally consider you and your feelings more in daily life.	0
How jealous do you get in a relationship?	Um, not at all? If a woman is dating me then that means that she wants me more than other men in her life. If she behaves inappropriately with other men then she's not worth keeping around. Being jealous is a waste of time.	I feel like the odd man out here. I get jealous pretty often. I've had problems with it actually, the thing is I think it's apart of my nature. I could pretend I don't get jealous but that would be a lie. Best way to deal with it for me is just ignoring the feeling and realizing that my mind makes thing annoyingly complicated most times and to not listen to it all the time.	0
Those Who Have Been Gaslit, How Did You Learn To Trust Your Emotions Again?	My ex tried to gaslight me by telling me I knew she was her other lovers slave (my one, only and last poly relation). Yeah, they were in a dom/sub relationship when roommates while I lived 2 hours away. I later found out he was dropping her into subspace 2, 3 times a day and reprogramming her in his image. I don't know if i will trust again but I do know the experience changed me... and not for the better.	I became Sherlock. Started carrying a little pad of paper and pen. Wrote down specifics that he said and when. Then, when he invariably changed his answer, I could prove to myself that he was full of shit. He was full of shit. Actions speak louder than words, big time. But, words count too, when speaking of gaslighting.	0
What is the biggest age gap in a relationship that you know of and how are the couple now?	My cousin is 28 and his girlfriend is 61. They met while he was bartending, she owned the bar and was a widow. They have been dating 4 years it's really awkward at family get together and social gatherings. He is a two time felon and I am constantly wondering how awesome the ending of this relationship will be.	Biggest age gap was with me (F18) and my ex (M42). He was abusive and incredibly controlling. Broke up in four months. Currently with a 32 year old. Going on seven months, he's immature but stable. I'm mature but anxious/depressed. Works for us.	1
What are subtle signs that someone isn't a good partner?	Always feeling like you have to apologize for them and their behavior at social events. Happened a lot with one of my exes, I feel like I had a mental block about it.	Anybody can be partners with anyone else. Partners aren't just bad in the sense that a tomato is bad past it's expiration date. There are layers to people and this is really just an incredibly immoral question at worst, and ignorant at best. Diverse people means diverse needs in a relationship. There's also the evolution of a relationship where people grow from the needs of each other. Don't just blanket this under the sense of a "normal guy". No one is normal and we are all flawed in one way or another. I'm sorry to rant but the point of view that this question even comes from is intolerance.	1
Men, what are some common dating mistakes you've seen girls make?	The only similarities women have with each other is the fact they are women. There's far too much variation to pick out any generalisations. At least in my experience.	Playing 2 guys against each other thinking it will result in some romantic over the top gesture by one of them, when in reality it creates drama and a social cluster fuck.	0
Mods of r/AskMen, what are your pet peeves about modding for this subreddit?	Honestly, besides the dickheads who can't just have a good time and try to push their shit or be a dick to other people here... It's when I get a good kick going... modding hard for a few days straight, clearing the modqueue, answering modmails, baleeting FAQ and trollposts by the millisecond... and 3 days later a drunk /u/nickachu_ is bitching to me in Slack about how shit my action numbers are, and I am an old has-been burnout. K.	Honestly, besides the dickheads who can't just have a good time and try to push their shit or be a dick to other people here...

How many of you won't identify as a feminist despite broadly agreeing with its ideals?	The main thing I dislike about the word is that everyone has a different definition, there is no consistency. I don't like using it because I have no idea what the other person thinks when they hear it.	I don't identify as a feminist because first and foremost I am a Christian. Any other -ist or -ism is less important to me in my book. I believe that Jesus gave an example of treating women equally, an example that was very radical for his day. If we truly follow Jesus (not men who use Christianity as a political tool) then feminism/equality will be the natural byproduct. I have also been told on more than one occassion that I "can't" be a feminist due to being pro-life/anti-abortion/whatever.	1
When did you really start taking care of your body?	I haven't really. I'm still young, 26, so I'm trying to start some easy-to-maintain habits and slowly build. For now, I cook a week of (vegan) meals every Saturday night and do a yoga routine from YouTube every night.	In my early 20s. I was kind of fat, but my dad's family is full of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. I didn't want to end up like them. Now 20 years later, I'm in decent shape. Never wanted to look like John Cena. I do it for my health, not to be swole for chicks.	0
Guys who are good with women: How good are you at sensing a woman is interested in you?	If it's a bar or coffee shop or something and you've seen some indication of interest, usually a smile and prolonged eye contact, you can generally just walk up and say "Hi, I'm name, what's yours?" Small talk for a bit and then ask if you can sit with them. Don't worry about your intent, attractive women get hit on all the time so they know perfectly well what your intentions are. Just treat them like a person and if they're into you they'll reciprocate. If they don't then just take it in stride. I once asked a girl her name and she said "is that the best you can do?" I noped out super fast, I'm not some dancing monkey, I'm just a person trying to get to know you. Same goes for ghosting, it's just disrespectful, you've gotta learn that it's gonna happen and just let it be.	I only establish intent. I make it quite clear when I approach women that I'm attracted to them and my end goal is to get in between those sweet walls. Straight up tell them that I don't want to be their friend. I don't want to meet casually. I don't want to "hang out". I don't want to "just talk". I already have enough friends. I'm not interested in whatever she's interested in. Let's go to dinner. My goal is to nut deep in her belly. Works more often than you'd think. Also if a girl ghosts you, consider that a problem that solved itself.	1
What happened that made you realize life isn’t fair?	I'm 30 and never had sex, compared to some guys who have no problem finding it when they want it.	I know good people who died young, and I know pieces of shit that are in there 80's and still spreading misery.	0
How have you unknowingly Pavlov'd yourself, or another person?	If I'm with a group of people and they're taking too long to leave I jingle my keys. Since most people associate that sound with leaving, they usually get out the door in a few seconds without me nagging.	A lot of times my SO gets boners just having me around, fully clothed. I come home, he sees me, and then gets a boner. Also, my dog used to have a long lead we would put him on to let him wander the backyard without straying too far. It was made out of some kind of polymer so in the dead of winter I guess it got too cold and it snapped. I realized this when he was asking to go out in the freezing early morning, so I just attached the 2ft broken end to his collar and sent him out. He stayed right within the range the full lead used to have.	1
Women who are/were fans of "The Sims", which version and/or expansion was your favourite?	I liked the first one best. But I recently downloaded sim city on my phone and it's even better. :)	Sims 2. It wasn't perfect, but I really loved how weird it was, and Open for Business was great. I do still love Sims 3 - the customisation and open world were fantastic additions - but it ran like shit on my computer, I had to download tons of mods just to get it to work, and the sims themselves were ugly as hell. So Sims 2 it is.	0
What's up with dudes not knowing how to wipe their butts?	I always assumed people who have problems with that are eating such horrible diets that every bathroom trip is a major toxic sludge cleanup job. More fiber, less grease. If you're regularly in there wiping all day something is wrong.	I dated a physician in his early 50's that would leave brown streaks in his underwear. When I brought this to his attention he got upset and said that it was a normal thing. Dated a PhD in his mid 30"s with the same problem. When confronted same reaction and answer. The list goes on. Regardless of age, education or socioeconomic status... most men do not know how to wipe their ass.	1
What are your thoughts on OkCupid switching from usernames to legal names only?	I used OkC to meet my now-husband years ago, and I use it now to meet new people (open relationship). No way I'll continue to use it. Too fucking dangerous. I'll stick to Tinder, thank you very much.	Sounds like a great way to get most women to stop using their website. We already have to deal with enough creeps when just using a username.	0
What's the worst experience you have had with a girl which you were NOT dating?	Lost my hard-on in the middle of the act with this girl. Why? Because I undid her bra and her breasts fell out like water balloons. Poor girl was really attractive but hard the worst rack I'd ever seen. :(	Two girls at a bar I don't frequent got VERY mad at me for not wanting to talk to them after I sat down a ordered a beer. To be clear, I sat down, got a beer after a few minutes of waiting, and they started to be rude after 1 minute of small talk (didn't want to talk because of being tired after a long day). Still confused about it.	0
Women who have decided not to have children, what made you decide that?	Okay, so here's the thing: I want my children to exist, because I feel like I have good genes to pass on. I'd like to be an egg donor or something. That said, I don't actually want to have and raise kids. I don't really like kids, (some are pretty okay, though), and I get rather annoyed when I'm going on vacation or whatever, and have to figure out someone to take care of my cats. I just think I'd find it terrible having to plan around another human before I could even go out for a cup of coffee. I'm not saying I'll never have kids, because maybe one day I'll settle down, and feel like that would be an okay compromise. I am, however, saying that it hasn't happened yet, and I'm already in my 30s.	Realizing I didn't have to have kids is what caused me to decide I wasn't having any. Growing up it seemed like I had to have kids, which I had kind of admitted to myself, "Well this will be a miserable time in my life, but I'll get through it". When I realized having kids was optional, I decided I wasn't going to. How has it impacted my life? I feel much happier, not having pressure from something I don't want to do. How has it impacted my relationships? I only date people who also do not want children.	0

How often do people make snide remarks about your appearance while you're in public? What do they say?	No one does the only comment I could think was this guy randomly on a bus commenting how glad he wasn't my height. I'm 5'2 I'm pretty sure a ton of guys wants their girl this short apparently it's a fetish.	My entire life I have had a really red face. I get flushed very easily, so people will often ask about it. I never understood why someone would feel the need to comment on it and my face will inevitably get more red when they talk about it. Edit: you have no idea how great these comments have made me feel. I always thought I was alone with my insecurity. Now, I realize so many others struggle with a similar problem. Here’s to embracing our redness lol!	0
What is an issue that you and your female friends will never see eye-to-eye on?	Marriage makes no sense for men. There is no reason for the modern male to ever marry. It tethers his future and freedom to a document that will NEVER end in his favor when things fall apart. Expansion on the above: modern women are not trustworthy.	The only one I can think of is female and male sex toys. One of my good friends won't even take male sex toys seriously. Then I get into an argument with her talking about how that's a double standard. So women can have dildos and that's fine but if men have a fleshlight, that's disgusting? We never talked about it again.	0
What complaint about women are you absolutely sick of hearing?	Derailing, invalidation, and disrespectful commentary seem to be common themes in responses to people's answers here. If your comment does not meet the rules and guidelines for this sub, it will be removed.

Can you french braid your own hair?	Yes when my hair was longer. It took a bit to learn and yeah your arms will hurt but you can do it. I guess the trick is take it slow and use small chunks of hair slowly gathering more the more you braid. Practice makes perfect. Oh also, I learned to do it by feel and checking my work in a mirror after.	Weirdly, I find I do better if I don't use a mirror. The mirror just confuses things. It does take a lot of practice either way, or at least it did for me.	0
Is taking a break in a relationship healthy? Would anyone recommend it?	Translation: I think I can do better than you. If not we'll get back together in the future because I couldn't find any other options.	Translated from girlspeak: "I am at the peak of my lifetime beauty and sexual value. I want to fuck lots of other guys. Bye."	1
Dear Redditors, could you help me understand why men find my past weird?	> I went through high school thinking dating was really dumb (which it was at that age) and wasn't open to it. > In my first few years of university, I didn't meet anyone worthwhile, Frankly, you come off as egotistical, and pretentious, which *is* weird. Good for you for knowing what you want and being serious, but don't expect every candidate *you* find up to snuff to think along the same lines you do. Also, since you haven't dated, there's a good chance you only have a superficial idea of what you want, which means the prospective relationship is already off to a rocky start from his eyes. EDIT: Format	It's unusual and thus weird, but there's nothing wrong with that. You know what you want and what you don't want. That's fine. At the same time, you probably shouldn't just assume guys your age are only looking for hookups. I'm sure there are plenty of guys your age that are looking for long term relationships. I was when I was 20.	0
Have you ever kicked yourself for missing out on a sexual opportunity only to realize as you got older that you actually dodged a bullet?	I don't kick myself for my past, however as I have gotten older I have begun giving fewer and fewer shits about sex or my sexual history. As long as I'm getting off regularly enough that I'm not fiending, I'm good. I'm more concerned with other aspects of my life than the sex I am (or am not) having.	Fuck no. The more crazy fucked up sex you have, the more you can look back fondly on it while you're jackin it in the handicap shitter at work.	0
Men with depression, do you date? If so, how do you overcome the negative thoughts while on a date?	Find someone who brightens your day whenever you see them. Like if when you don't feel like getting out of bed and just staying there, drinking and smoking and watching stupid YouTube videos all day, when you decide "fuck life and everyone!", but then you find out that you can meet them so you just crawl out and fight. And you go meet them and the day becomes better. But I'm with bi-polar 2, so I get good moments when it's easier to meet someone that would make me battle my depression days and make them better.	Yes. Communication is the key and telling your SO when you are on your darkest days is a must. I try to overcome them by staying busy and having a "me" session of self-improvement.	0
What's a sacrifice if any that you have had to make in order to start succeeding at dating?	Money. Getting in shape, eating well, buying new clothes, etc. all cost money, and dating itself costs money too. I had to come to terms that this was an investment, and that I wasn't going to see any dividends until I put some money, time, and effort into it.	Cliché', but I had to stop being a *genuinely* nice guy. Not a NiceGuy^TM but a actual, genuine nice guy who just tried to treat women well and wasn't just out trying to get laid. Once I started being more of a dick and didn't really care whether I (emotionally) hurt women, my dating life picked up significantly. I didn't really like the person I had to become, but I got over it.	1
Fellow unattractive/average looking women, how do you prevent becoming bitter due to the treatment you get (or don't get) because of your physical appearance?	Find great, quality people who love me and don't judge on appearance. Find ways to raise my own self-esteem that aren't based on appearance, or are external, but are not based on the opinions of others. Be okay with having only so many people in my life (but that's just because I'm bad at putting myself out there, probably...)	Remember how uncomfortable it was to be hit on at my last job. I'm not attractive, but I'm in a male dominated field.	1
What has been your experience with a non-linear career path? Example (Art degree working in Medical field), went from a higher paying job to a lower paying job (Nurse to Starbucks barista), or changed jobs without getting a degree and no experience in the new job?	I got a degree in manufacturing / industrial engineering and worked in oil & gas for a few years before I rage quit. I ended up landing a job in semiconductors. I had zero tech experience. I even did one year in electrical engineering my first year of college before I realized I *sucked* at it and transferred out of it. Life is weird.	I left a successful career in web development to pursue biology, specifically conservation biology. I'll get back to you at the end of my masters about whether or not I can actually make a living...	1
What's a red flag that you feel a lot more women should be aware of?	Clinginess or neediness that can turn ugly. A short fuse that they quickly try to gloss over. Putting themselves down but acting like they are above others.	Similar to littering, I live in an area with free municipal recycling. So I'd say zero effort of trash sorting. One time my friends group went out to a rural area for the weekend with no recycling service. We saved it all and drove it the two hours back to town to put in our home recycling :p	1
Former ugly men of Reddit, how did you clean up?	Honestly not sure if I am or ever was ugly, but I started shaving, take more showers, and change my pillow cases more often to keep my face clean. Also started getting haircuts more often to keep my hair looking nicer. Even though I'm not overweight, very little of my weight is muscle so I cut back on calories, once I lose enough I'll stop cutting and try to put more muscle on. Seems to be working well, I think I look better so far.	If you can "clean up" you were never ugly in the first place. What a stupid question from a guy that supposedly listens to Bach.	1
What's with the negative stigma around being uncircumcised in America?	I just don't understand the hygiene reasoning for circumcision. Most people shower or clean themselves at least every other day and it's not even hard to just pull it back and rinse the fucker. I've never had any problems with my penile hygiene and I haven't even been able to fully retract my foreskin until recently because of a medical problem.	>For clarity, I myself am not trying to campaign for anti-circumcision. Well you should be. It's borderline child abuse... just like corporal punishment, it's that same gray area.	1
Women of color, what is one thing you wish the general population understood but seemingly doesn't?	People make it difficult for me to discuss sexism in my culture because anything I say is used by racists to "prove" that my people are savage and backwards.	That interracial racism is real. Some races can have many privileges over others. So as everyone seems to belittle this to having a "pissing contest on who has the shittiest treatment", that is actually true. Some races have better shit handed to them so let us not forget that, nor act as if we have the same struggles.	1
What do you wish you had discussed with your SO before you dated them or married them?	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders to your partners. Responses are welcome from all relationships regardless of genders.	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders to your partners. Responses are welcome from all relationships regardless of genders.	1
What are the most confusing "signals" a guy has given you?	Recently I met a guy who I was super into. He started texting me in a way that gave the vibe he was into me, not in a booty call way but in a "hey how are you?" relationship way. I was excited to go to a party where I knew he'd be at. We had a great time at the party but..Well this other girl was very drunk and all over him and it made me upset so I had to leave. As soon as I get up to go he gives me a bear hug. ???!? Idk my brain still hurts. Also alcohol.	I had a guy who would tell me he loved me then ignore me for a week. Then he'd see me somewhere randomly and tell me how beautiful I was. Then he'd ignore me for another week. And it was just set on repeat for awhile. I was sooo infatuated with that asshole.	0
Hello men. Can you please explain to me what the gym etiquette is when it comes to talking to others, and what your own motivations are when it comes to talking to a girl at the gym?	I think the only things I say to people at the gym fall into the following categories * Are they using that machine/equipment much longer * Can I jump in between their sets * Do you know if anyone is using this or did the last person just not rack their damn weights * Nice job on the set/weight/progress * Can you spot me * Can you pull this off me if I royally fuck up * Does this leg raise machine look like I'm riding a jetpack when I first lift myself?	a woman said "hey, i've been seeing you at the gym, looking good!" i got SO MAD about it, how dare someone compliment me!?!	1
Have you ever met a famous person? What were they like? Were they down to earth, or super rude?	Amanda Bynes. Years ago when I was a teen. Before she had a decline. She saw me standing. Hoping for an autograph. I was too shy to ask. But she came up to me. Asked if I wanted one. Took pictures with me. And was super kind. It's sad she's had some issues lately. She was lovely when I met her.	Yeah, lots. They kinda ran the gamut, honestly. The one thing I did find is that the rudest or most pretentious people weren't the actually famous ones, it was the people who were more... fame-adjacent? Like they were almost famous but not quite. They had a much higher likelihood of being insufferable, I found. Like they were clinging so hard to the scrap of fame they had, that they needed to prove it to everyone else.	1
What is your cause and what can I change about my daily lifestyle to further it?	Homelessness. Donate food to shelters and food banks - NOT expired packets of ranch seasoning that have been sitting in the back of your cabinet, donate things that won't just need to be thrown out by an employee or volunteer as soon as they're delivered. Volunteer with a shelter. Do it regularly. You'll learn how easy it is to become homeless and how difficult it is to get out of it. You'll meet people, and help people. You might get a free meal out of it, I work at a shelter and we always feed volunteers if there isn't a food shortage. The food is often surprisingly delicious.	Mine is animal rights and the environment. I'm a vegan and believe in speciesism. Watch Earthlings and stop consuming animal products. Stop going to zoos and aquariums. Don't buy your pets from breeders, take in rescues instead. And so forth.	1
How has your personal relationship with religion changed as you have aged?	My parents can't make me go anymore. Never really believed as a kid and it didn't do a thing for me and am an open atheist now.	Bought up low level Christian. Church happened but only on occasion. The more I looked at the bible as I got older the more I saw it as a terrible book. I guess I just drifted away from it. I'm not religious but don't like the smugness of the athiests either.	1
Dads whats going through your mind when meeting your daughters boyfriend for the first time?	Don't have kids old enough to be in this situation, but I can tell you my father-in-law's approach of saying, "So, have you fucked my daughter yet?" is absolutely the wrong approach.	As a Brother with a lil sister. Just be normal, but watchful. Does he shake your hand right, does he look you in the eye when talking to you, since this is his first time meeting you he should probably call you sir.	1
Those of you who can afford to live independently but choose to live with parents in the meantime, what's your view on the American tradition of moving away from home asap?	It's weird to me. Being Asian, it's normal to stay with our families into our mid to late twenties or even until we get married. Yeah it sucks sometimes when my mom still calls to ask me where I am, but it's something that I can put up with for not having to paying +$1000 of rent a month. With this economy right now, there is a trend of a lot of people moving back in with their parents. Thank god, because I swear when I was on Okcupid, it was a deal breaker to a lot of white people to be living at home.	Shortsighted and immature. One of my latino friends is an engineer. He lives in the south, makes like $80k/year, and lives with his parents. If I had to guess, I'd say he saves $50k/year.	1
When have you felt the least attractive?	When my 5'4 ex girlfriend told me I was too short (5'9) and she couldn't wear her favorite heels around me.	High school. Overweight, acne, bad hair do, no clothing sense. I was standing in the lunch line and we didn't tend to stand facing forward, we'd stand basically sideways, shoulder to shoulder. The girl in front of me was pretty and made me feel like i shouldn't look her way as to not come off as a creep or whatever so i was looking away. Then i felt like i could feel her looking at me so i turn and lock eyes with her and she just goes, "Uhg" and makes a face of being absolutely repulsed. That i think is the singular point i can point back to as to when physical insecurities began growing and the anxiety around girls started. I was like, 15. Other stuff happened as well, but i'd say that highschool girls are some of the most brutal people on the planet.	0
Other than "nothing", what is the sexiest outfit you have ever seen a woman wear (in person)?	My ex had a perfect little body. She was shaped perfectly and had awesome muscle tone. She had a tight form fitting white dress with blue and green horizontal stripes at the top. The dress went all the way to her ankles so there was no skin showing except her arms. My god, she wore that on our first date and I could get nothing else out of my mind for the next month and a half. We went to some shitty bar and some dude grabbed her ass and I honestly couldn't blame him. I was fuming mad... but I understood.	A regular green bikini top and bottom. You know how in lame movies sometimes a group of husbands or whatever are all just sitting around by the pool and then their wives come out in swimsuits and the camera goes into slow-mo on them walking, some generic 80's arena rock starts playing, and the guys all lean in and tip their sunglasses down? Maybe one of them says "Daaaaamn" or some cheesy line? Yeah, that's how it felt when she came out. Damn, that girl was hot and she knew it.	0
How the hell do I go to a club and do it right?	you go in with some people, get absolutely wrecked, dance like an idiot and talk to everyone you bump in to at the bar etc then you've either hooked up with someone with your slick moves or you're throwing up down the street	Every time I've had fun at a club there were three main ingredients. 1. Go with a group of good friends 2. Bring a girl, I know clubs are supposed to be places to get women. But it's very loud and women are so guarded in clubs I've found it's easier to just bring your own. 3. Drink enough alcohol to allow yourself to go crazy on the dance floor. If that's one drink so be it, I need several.	1
Alternatively, do you have a brother who fits the "neckbeard" or "forever alone" stereotype? How is your realtionship with him?	I did. It was awesome. We would chat everyday and game together and buy ridiculous amounts of junk food and have lans, and send each other funny internet links constantly. Then he lost weight, asked me to help shop for new clothes, and became ridiculously social and went travelling, met a woman who is now his wife, and moved to the US. And now I will be lucky if he initiates a conversation with me every 6 months, or responds to any of my messages. It makes me sad.	I love my brother dearly, but he is a bit if a neckbeard. Hi isn't misogynistic (he has 3 intelligent and reasonably successful sisters, so it would be a bit hard to be). He isn't really strong on social intelligence and tends to be very over opinionated and stubborn. He goes on tirades. I mostly just smile and listen, make small corrections here and there. Arguments do no good, so you need to be patient to correct the behavior. He has made some big strides in the past 4 years and I am very proud of him for that.	1
What is it like moving to a completely new city alone?	Hey man! I just moved to Vienna alone. Expect your friends to act like they care but as soon as you are away they won't give a shit bout how you are doing. But after a long cry alone, you'll be fine. Gives you a lot of opportunities, and hey what else is life for? Sometimes you need to be alone to find yourself and do what you always wanna had done. Don't be afraid, be yourself! You have the bravery to make that move, that alone should tell you you are special. Go on and imagine all the good things that may happen. What would it help to stay where you are?	It sounds awesome at first because of the thrill of moving to a new city. Then it sucks for a while because you realize you don't have any close friends and the closest people you have are thousands of miles away. You cry and spend time alone in your apartment. You realize you can't do this forever. It slowly starts to get better as you start making new friends and putting yourself out there in the new city. TL;DR: It's awesome at first. Then it sucks for a while. It gets better though. Source: moved from San Francisco to Chicago.	0
What is something your SO has done that absolutely broke your heart?	We've been together since 2002. He knows my birthday means a lot to me. I don't ask for extravagant things or dinner at some 5 star restaurant. This year he, and our children (who are younger than 12) didn't do anything. I thought they were pulling my leg. Nope. I didn't even get a card. If I hadn't said it was my birthday they wouldn't have even wished me a happy birthday. He took me out for breakfast because we hadn't eaten, so it was just another day. It sounds stupid. But it hurt more than anything over the last 14 years with him.	I expect the one person I've given it completely to to treat my heart with enough care that it'd never be "absolutely broken".	1
"Nice girl syndrome" - I feel like I embody this completely. Is this something that's considered negative (story included)?	This is pretty much the stereotypical friend-zoned nice guy situation, except with a nice girl instead. I'll give you the same advice. It's interesting how niceness relates to and interacts with attraction and romance. In my opinion, niceness is not a negative itself, but often it's used to cover up (or it's just a mislabelling of) things that are negatives, like insecurity or desperation (usually the belief that you don't have anything else to offer, so you'll just be really nice). With that said, niceness is also not going to secure attraction by itself. Who becomes attracted to someone just because they were nice to them? Unless they also have problems with insecurity, not many people. Most people will say they want a nice person as a partner, but what they really mean is that they want an attractive person who's also nice. That's how I see niceness.	There's no such thing as "nice girl syndrome" with guys. There's "not as attractive as the other girl syndrome." Sorry, but it's true.	1
Here’s a thought experiment: If you took sexuality out of the equation, how many of the women you’ve ever dated would you actually be friends with? Some? Most?	Probably about half. At this point, I won't date anyone I couldn't see myself being friends with. Sex is great, but I'm weird enough that if we couldn't be friends, we're probably not compatible as anything more than fuck buddies.	None. I have nothing in common with them. I don't solve my problems by crying until someone fixes them for me, I am not interested in things like baking or flower arranging, and it bores me to tears when someone wants to complain without even thinking of a solution never mind working towards one. I also really wouldn't be friends with people whose core idea about men are hostile and deep down want men to be hurt, any more than black folks would have Klansmen friends, etc. I'm exaggerating to make a point but still. Nothing wrong with any of the above, it's just not me and I can't really work with that.	1
Inspired by AM, what's the worst injury you've had happen to your vagina?	When I was a young teenager and fairly foolish, I got the great idea once to put hand sanitizer on my vagina. Don't put hand sanitizer on your vagina.	I fell off a platform at a club and landed spread eagle on the corner. My labia were lopsided for two weeks. Pants were hard.	1
What interest/hobby do you enjoy that you don't tell people about? Why do you keep it secret or choose not to talk about it much?	I like sitting and colouring. I don't tell many people because a lot assume it's really childish and that I'm weird, but I find it really soothing and it helps me when I'm stressed.	Another on for me is feminism. I don't like being randomly attacked by rabid MRAs for "hating men" when I've probably done more for men's rights than most of them. I don't enjoy guys suddenly "devils advocating" on dating sites or Facebook or whatever because being a feminist means "come question me with ridiculous straw man situations because I believe in equality". So yeah, I just tend to not mention it unless I know someone has a reasonable view of feminism (is a feminist or at least has a somewhat nuanced understanding of feminism but disagrees with parts of it, or even knows nothing about feminism but is curious about it).	1
What is a (Harsh) truth about an ex you found out during or after the relationship?	Textbook Alcoholism. We were together short of 6 months and we never actually had full on PIV because she was always too drunk and I didn't want to "dead fish" my GF. Granted I was in college and bartending at the time, so it's not like I was some kind of saint, but yeah, she was off the tracks. Also, one time when she was wasted she blurted out "I used to be chunky, but I smoked meth for about 18 months and I lost a bunch of weight and but got to keep these big tits".	That she was a massive introvert and wasn't going to change. We had very similar senses of humor, we had similar interests, and I thought she was incredibly attractive, but she was also immensely shy and quiet around people she didn't know. I kind of hoped that if I took her out more, she might come out of her shell, but after almost a year, I figured out that that was not going to happen.	1
Seriously missing my ex lately. Can I hear your stories about how you met someone ever better than an ex you thought you'd never get over?	My husband and I broke up for 5 months when we were 7 months into our relationship. I was upset and we didn't talk until months later. I was determined not to get back together with him because he's the one that broke up with me and now 4 years later were as happy as can be and married with 2 dogs and a cat.	I'm sorry that I don't have any advice. I'm in the same situation and I'm still feeling hurt and abandoned. In my mind, it will just take time. I keep myself busy with work and spending time with friends. Having a support system is essential however, I understand that the pain is still there. Stay positive, we will get through this.	0
A guy kissed me last night. Should I tell my SO? Would you like to know?	This shit drives me nuts. How could you NOT have gotten away from the guy? If OP was unable to leave the situation that constitutes sexual assault. If you were sexually assaulted there should be consequences for the prepatrator. More likely OP willingly cheated on her SO and is now trying to bypass the guilt by skewing the recollection of events Downvote me to hell but this victimization scenario you've built sounds like a crock of shit.	Just tell him immediately, especially if honesty is important to you guys. If it happened to my SO I'd much rather hear it from her and have her explain than from someone else that saw it.	0
What's a favourite thing your animal does, or a favourite moment you've spent with them?	Never had a cat. I've got 2 dogs now. The small one like to climb into my lap no matter what I'm doing. He sleeps best curled up behind my knees, and is currently "talking" to my husband. Hubby's ignored him today, and he wants attention.	My cat gives me eskimo kisses every morning when we wake up. He's so affectionate. I roll over onto my back and he stands on my chest. Purring like crazy. All I have to say is , "Can I have kisses?" and he leans over and rubs his nose on mine. He also does this adorable thing where he gets up in my arms and lays like a baby on his back. I give him belly rubs and he rubs his ear with his paw. When he's super happy he always rubs his ears. It's so cute.	0
My brother is falling into the hands of a gang, how do I stop it?	The gang is giving him a sense of belonging and purpose. You have to give him a better counter offer.	Throw a knife at the gang's hand. Your brother cant fall into the hands of a gang if its hands are disabled.	1
Women gamers, what kind of situations have you been in that made you wish you had kept your gender a secret?	So I don’t really play online games like MOBAs anymore after some bad experiences. Basically if people found out I was a girl, one of three things often happened: - one or more of my team would spend the whole game around me ‘protecting’ me like I was some high value target - some guys would just hang round me in the game like a weird form of flirting. Like I’d want to either date them or sleep with them. - If the other team found out I was a girl, some of them would stalk me for easy kills. Plus, if we lost it tended to be my fault! There were occasions where people would be like “she’s a girl.....cool” and play on. But what I described above happened enough to be annoying and off-putting.	Too often. I'm trans and my voice is not entirely masculine or feminine, and often when I speak on voice comms it gets mentioned. "Are you a chick or a dude?" etc. And I either tell them I'm a woman, and then the trans comments start, or I go silent and lose out on voice comms or people keep making a thing of it if I just ignore the question.	1
What is your "I'm the douchebag boyfriend story"?	I once dated a girl who I didn't find that attractive physically. She was really nice and awesome to hangout with though. I took her virginity, cheated on her with two other chicks, then dumped her all in one month.	I had a FB once who didn't have a car. She would get her "friend", who was obviously head-over-heels in love with her and her complete slave to drive her to my house for booty calls. The first time she made him wait in the car, the after that I let her invite him in and he got to play my consoles on the big screen while we banged. I've never had a dude hate me so much, but force himself to be so polite. I enjoyed that part as much as the sex, maybe even more. Not sure if this technically counts but it's the #1 story that comes to mind from your prompt.	0
When was the lowest point in your life? How old were you and how did you dig yourself out of it? How are you now?	Emigrated just to find myself without a job a doing a lot of shitty, less than minimum wage jobs. I managed to get a small grant to enroll for a Masters and live for a year. After the Masters I managed to land a job and the rest is history.	When the girl I loved left me. It made me realize how much I relied on her to make me feel good about myself. Without her validation I was a mess, but it made me realize that stepping my life up in all aspects was absolutely necessary. If you are in love with someone you should absolutely be prepared to be alone in an instant, would you be happy with yourself if no one was there to validate you. That's the question. EDIT: this is one of life's many catch 22 scenarios. I was holding onto this woman for validation because of her status and beauty, when in reality thats what caused her to leave. If i was my own man at that time things would have been a lot different.	0
What is something (significant or silly) that all of your exes seem to have in common?	Throwin in my 2 cents- I seem to end up with busty blonde artists that have Elizabeth somewhere in their name. Weird thing is, I'm generally more attracted to technically inclined brunettes. Dunno why the opposite keeps happening.	Ok this is really weird but I was thinking about this exact question a few months ago and I have never dated anyone with divorced parents. I really don't have a physical type and they are as different as can be in terms of personality, but all of their parents are still together.	0
What is your radical political idea?	I'm not American so I don't live with this problem but I think America needs gun control really fucking badly. I think most Americans are in denial about this problem. In Canada we have gun control and yes we still have shooting but look at the difference in rates. That can't just be because of population size. America also needs proper healthcare I don't know why conservatives are soooo against universal healthcare. These are probably the biggest reasons I would never move to America.	I don't think these are that radical but depending on company saying I am for legalizing weed and prostitution can get dicey. This from the united state perspective.	0
How often do you orgasm simultaneously with whomever you're having sex with?	I'd put it at 95%+ of the time. My orgasm is almost entirely controlled by hers, I have a very hard time getting off during sex if she doesn't orgasm at the same time. Thankfully there's plenty of opportunity since she is multi-orgasmic.	Pretty much never, my current partner and I have been together for 2+ years and I think it has happened twice? Those times were amazing but I don't really get off from piv, so it's just not expected.	0
Do you treat pretty women differently than ugly women ?	So I was in a restaurant. I noticed two women and a man at the ice cream area. The man gets himself a scoop of ice cream, the 2 women are waiting their turn. The woman that was next, was very pretty. Conventionally attractive. The man looks at her and then offers to get her scoop for her. After he gets her scoop, its the other womans turn. She was much less pretty and heavier. She looks at him, I can tell,shes expecting the same offer. The man hands her the scoop and walks off. All i thought was ouch...	Due to bullying, I have an inner hate for conventionally attractive women (or women I'm attracted to), so I tend to try not to talk to them at all. Any time I do occasionally talk to them they are just too confident, usually up themselves and a bit arrogant. "Ugly" women? In my experience these women are very nice and usually have everything I look for in a relationship but even if I don't look for a relationship (hasn't happened yet I'm 17 and cba), they are more friendly and are better friends. So I don't treat ugly girls better, just in my experience they are better people than good looking girls. edit: inb4 all the good looking girls and shallow guys downvote me	1
How many sexual partners have you had? How many LTRs have you been in?	I'm 41. I couldn't tell you how many sexual partners I've had. God knows. 100+ I think. I've been in two long term relationships -I married them both. I had a long term affair as well but maybe best not to count that one.	I'm 25 and Asian-American. I've had sex with 3 girls, all of whom are also the long-term girlfriends I've had. I may sound old-fashioned, but I only have sex with a girl who I am officially in an exclusive relationship with. I have made out with girls at parties, and even tried to have casual sex with one, but I backed out of it because I just couldn't get more intimate without the emotional feelings a relationship brings.	0
Why are so many questions directed to women here about relationships or partners?	Because that's one of the few things that both men and women are involved in, in which a woman's unique perspective is unattainable to a man through experience.	Because they didn’t know /r/relationshipadvice existed and they have nothing else they can think of to talk to a woman about.	1
What's a compliment that you rarely receive but, when you do, it means a lot to you?	I don't like compliments. I know what I do well, I don't need anyone else's opinion. Constructive criticism or shut up.	It's such a bro thing but if someone mentions that they can tell I've been working out or a friend will say "You're looking big, dude" or something. That feels nice. Also when people compliment things that I've done or built. Like I redid my landscaping in front of my house shortly after moving in. My dad comments on it every time he comes over with "you've made this all look so much better" Feels good.	0
Old men of Reddit: What was the key to your successful marriage?	Woman here with a general comment. A lot of you are mentioning romance (including sexy time and just together time). For me, vulgarity is the opposite of romance. I can't seem to make my husband understand that, while I'm not a prude, distasteful and crude language will ensure no sex for at least two days because it completely turns me off. Not just off sex, but I don't want to even hang out with him because I am truly disgusted. So please guys, know your woman!! A lot of women would not give two shits about this, but I do, and I bet I'm not alone here.	When arguing with your SO, the goal isn't to win the argument. The goal is to solve a problem. Nobody is a fucking mind reader, so don't go to your SO with *you should know why I'm upset* bullshit. If you're doing things to intentionally hurt your SO, you're an idiot. The strongest relationships come from two strong, happy individuals coming together, not two broken individuals relying on each other for happiness.	0
Men of reddit, have you ever been overwhelmed by the possibility of getting the girl you are seeing pregnant, that you avoid having sex with her altogether?	I once was together with a girl who was so .... naive and god damn stupid when it came to protection, that I kinda stopped sleeping with her for a while. E.g. she frequently forgot to take her pill and once she decided not to take the morning after pill after she fucked up because she was on a ski trip and it is certainly okay to take it after 48 hours. I was so sick of the monthly nightmare that I broke up with her. However, we somehow got together again after a few weeks and we switched to another solution. So yeah, pregnancy was a threat to my life plans and options back in the days and it lead not only to abstinence but also to a breakup.	If getting her pregnant would be as much of a disaster as you make it sound, then you probably shouldn't be seeing her.	1
Whats the most dangerous thing your child has done?	I laid my son down for a nap in his crib when he was 18 months old. He climbed out of his crib (had never done that before) and then climbed onto a rocking chair, up the back of it, and then pushed out a screen and went out the window. The window looked out onto the flat roof on the mud porch of the house. My baby was on the roof. My neighbor saw him and banged on the door. When she told me, I ran upstairs and yanked him back in. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. He's 15 now :)	When he was about 4, he pulled his hand out of my mother's and ran across a lane of the parking lot. After that, my mother and I had a short but intense discussion about how she actually has to *hold* his hand and not just rely on him gripping her finger.	1
Do you ever get romantically interested in a woman after you find out that she likes you?	i would think it depends on the guy.... most guys: "she likes me, quick see how fast i can get sex" other guys: "try and get her number, i love never getting a call back" me: "ok, whos playing a joke"	Definitely. The way it normally works is I see dozens of decent looking women every day and don't usually give it a whole lot of thought -- I mean, approaching every good looking girl I encounter would be a little absurd, and unless I'm just looking to hook up, I have no reason to believe most would be a good match anyway. If she expresses interest though, she's no longer some random girl; she's a girl who's interested, so now there's a reason to really stop and take notice. Doesn't mean I'm going to be into her, but I'll at least consider it, which is a big step.	0
What motivates you to go to the gym ?	Motivates me? You're doing it wrong. It's part of my routine. I made my decision to do it, planned how I was going to do it, and then stuck to my plan. Told myself I'd re-evaluate the plan after 6 months.	I want a nice body. I like being able to see the progress. I want to be bigger than I am right now.	0
What is something you know that you wish you didn't?	Not eating starch (glucose) causes hair loss. Not eating meat means you have to supplement. Eating out means generally eating poison unless you spend a whole lot of money eating at the finest places.	When I was in high school, I found my parents' sex pictures. It was so unexpected and out of place, I stared at them way longer than I should have trying to figure out what the fuck I was looking at. It looked like legit amateur porn or something, and I didn't realize they were my parents until it was far too late. I wish I could forget.	0
Is 30 too old to sow your wild oats?	30 is not too old by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I'd say 30 is the best age to do it. 1. I'm assuming you have a higher paying job than a good chunk of your 20-something counterparts 2. I'm assuming you're better put together than your 20-something counterparts. Meaning you dress better and have the money to put into dressing better. 3. Being a little older plays to your advantage. You're not young and dumb and you have the appeal of being older to the opposite sex. 30 isn't 35 or 40. Don't try and kick it with 18 year olds, though, because that's just weird. 21 is still too young. You'll have more than enough tail to chase that's your own age.	Probably, you'll just be that 'weird creepy old guy' at the club that we're all familiar with. I suggest not going activities meant for 20yr olds	1
Men who started receiving female attention later on in life, how did it feel and how did you deal with your new “popularity” among girls?	Honestly at first I thought it was some sort of an elaborate conspiracy hoax among the women in our town to trick me somehow. Then I realized that there's no way all these people know each other and why would they scheme only against me. Took a while to get used to it lol.	I still don’t know how to handle it. It’s so overwhelming to be able to fuck a new girl every week. Fucked 420 hoes in the last 69 weeks, feels good bruh	1
What is it that's fundamentally wrong with fapping to friends/co-workers?	If you are unable to treat someone with kindness and respect merely because you think they're hot and attractive, then you have much bigger problems that your masturbation habits.	People are easily offended by things they have no control over. There is nothing wrong with, but it certainly is awkward to talk about. I don't, but my brain doesn't work that way. When I have sexual thoughts, the other players tend to be sort of weirdly generic.	1
What is the cringiest way you've ever shown interest in someone you wanted to date, that still makes you want to crawl away and die of shame?	Asked for their facebook immediately after the date. Apparently that is creepy because that is too personal. I'm a man and for all she knows I might come to her house and kill her. Women have to deal with creepy dudes all the time so I understand why they might be scared.	Well, here it goes -- I once waited right beside the stir-fry section of our dining hall trying to work up the courage to ask out a guy who worked in the dining hall. I was there for like two hours and I *finally* worked up the courage to ask him out on a date. It turns out that he had absolutely no idea who I was and we had a class together the previous semester that was capped at 15 students. Oh god.	0
What is the reason for smelling women's hair?	I've personally never done it, but I did have a girlfriend that did it to me. It's like she was snorting coke or something sometimes.	Your scent. Your scent is a very powerful aphrodisiac. It is normal throughout the entire animal kingdom. Hard to resist and always intoxicating.	0
What do you wish your parents had done differently when raising you?	I slightly wish there was more emphasis on physical activity and healthy eating--or at least that we had done more together as a family. I would never put all the blame on my parents instead of myself, but if I'd grown up with more models of physical activity=fun!, I might not be quite as fat and lazy as I am now. Maybe. I don't know.	I wish they would've made me read more. I can only imagine what my vocabulary would've been like had I spent more time reading book than watching pointless TV shows.	1
My female friends advised me that I shouldn't shower my boyfriend with so many presents because men do not like to be taken care of like that...men, is this true for you?	Unsolicited advice: don't take advice on how men think or feel from women. Women are not men. They don't know how we feel. This is why Cosmo is nonsense. Women telling women how men think. You wanna know how guys think, ask guys -- like you have here. Even better? Ask **THE** guy. Your partner. Ask *him* how he feels. It's entirely dependent on the individual. I, as a person, find it difficult to accept help, gifts, or compliments from people, friends, and partners. Family environment didn't include that sort of support. So getting that stuff now is unfamiliar and trippy. It's something I need to work through.	It depends. If the sex is inadequate, yeah, I'll be totally put off and pushed away by nonsexual affection. Physical affection is the primary need I'm looking to fill by getting into a relationship, so that has to be satisfied before I can appreciate nonphysical forms of affection.	1
What is the most pathetic/ridiculous thing another man has done in attempt to assert his dominance over you?	I asked a drunk guy to leave the store I was working at and he said " you wanna try me " ,I said "no" , he went "aa" and then left from the store.	Some guy in a bar was walking around really close to all the guys and getting their face while smirking. When it was my turn, he came up to me, I strategically placed my feet in a certain way, he kind of tripped, fell and spilled his drink all over himself. He said “you want to fucking fight me bro”. I said “you want to fucking fight me!?” While giving him a death stare. He kind of shivered and cowered away. The bartender gave me free drinks for the night, everyone clapped and gave me $100% dollars and I got the 2 hottest chicks in the bar and had a three some and someone gave me their lottery ticket which turned out to be a 50 million dollar ticket and now I’m set for life and I married both of those hot chicks.	1
Is it common for girls/women to do all these things without liking you as anything more than a friend?	You're not supposed to TELL her how you feel, you're just supposed to SHOW her how you feel by escalating (slowly). If she puts your hand on her leg, start rubbing, etc. ..	How old are you? From your post I'd guess high school, first year of college at the oldest. To me it sounds like this friend of yours is just enjoying your male attention and doesn't want more than that from you for whatever reason. It's a maturity thing most likely. All women are different, so of course you can't generalize and say they'll all be attention-hungry. Since she's rejected you, it's now up to you if you're going to continue hanging out with her or find a girl that wants you for more than a headrest.	0
What's your "holy grail" question that you always ask on a first date?	If marriage is something they want in their future. I don't flat out ask it, but I somehow work it into the conversation. It's not because I want to get married right away to the first guy who says yes. I've just already made the mistake of sticking around for someone who wasn't sure until it was too late to not be devastated by our different life goals.	"Why do you think we would be good together?" I'm also all about the intense interview style first date. Reddit has informed me this is a terrible approach, but it worked out well for me when dating.	1
What do you think of women slapping men on television shows?	I find it unfortunate that it's considered socially acceptable for a woman to hit a man when he says or does something (non-physical) that she doesn't like, and that a woman doing that in TV or movies is frequently portrayed as justified. The idea that a man can hit a woman for some offense is rightly seen as a relic of the 1950s, and there's no reason that it should be acceptable with the genders flipped. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter a [video campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJXAallsyY) aimed at changing attitudes on this.	I don't mind it at all, because it's not like a girl slapping a guy is really going to do much to him, compared to the other way around. People saying that a girl slapping a guy is the same as a guy slapping a girl are completely delusional to the physical differences between men and women.	1
Fide (The World Chess Federation) holds 2017 Women's World Championships in Iran, so the players must wear hijab (head covering) while in the venue and in public, because it is Iran and that's how they roll. Would you compete or boycott? Your thoughts on this decision?	I live in Afghanistan. Headscarfing is a part of my daily life, and I fucking love it. I have crazy-person curls, so headscarfing is a super easy way to a) blend in, b) respect local sensibilities, and c) look elegant as fuck. So no, i wouldn't boycott. I'm not Muslim, but for me headscarfing is such a non-issue that I can't be bothered to care.	As an Iranian American I don't know who thought holding the WOMENS championship in Iran was a good idea. I can attest to the fact that the country is very safe, but I personally think the laws regarding hijab are ridiculous and it was totally unnecessary to hold the championship there.	0
Men. Why types of men can you simply not stand and why?	I call them Dad-jokers. They're guys that say an unending stream of mediocre dad jokes, puns and double entendres, mostly around women in an effort to be funny. The problem isn't the joking itself (then they would be comedians and actually interesting), it's that 80% of the jokes are bad and bring nothing to otherwise interesting conversations.	Guys that are huge know it alls, trys to educate everyone, but literally has no idea what they are talking about. Had a dude in my college course that would sit and roll his eyes at you if you answered a question wrong. Someone would say something and he would fight you to the death saying it was wrong. He got below a 70% on all of his tests and literally passed the class by 1% with assistance from our lecture teacher. Everyone hated him.	0
My last boyfriend told me that I am a bit immature and annoying. I don't agree, but hey, I could be wrong. Ladies, what are characteristics of mature, non-annoying, responsible adult women?	This thread is basically an example of the immaturity. Who turns to the Internet for personality advice? We don't know you, and don't know your ex. I think it's immature that you would ask randoms on Reddit for input where we obviously have zero expertise. But hey, I could be wrong.	Mature: You keep your promises, or apologize sincerely if you don't. You don't lie. You don't try to "cute" your way out of trouble. You generally take care of yourself and don't expect someone else to clean up after you (either physically or emotionally). You understand that your actions have consequences and deal with those. You can productively spend time by yourself. You don't "need" to be in a relationship or company all the time.	0
My girlfriend is currently the centre of my life (by choice), is this bad?	Yes, it is. Never make your woman your mission. You will lose both your mission and your woman this way. However, it sounds like you have outgrown your old friends (because they are stuck in high school party mode, and you aren't). Make your studies your mission, and make some new friends, ones that you do not share with her. This will keep you and your relationship healthy.	I wouldn't call what you're describing as making your gf the center of your life. It just sounds to me like you're growing out of the partying lifestyle while at the same time focusing more on your relationship. The two are only loosely connected, although who's to say that if you were single you wouldn't still enjoy all the partying? Tbh it's a natural progression for most guys, I think. All the drinking and carrying on is fun when you're late teens/early 20s but as you get older it just doesn't hold the same appeal. Then you get all responsible and shit.	0
What embarrassing things have you done in front of your SO's parents?	Closest would be me telling their son to work out more to be as fit as his dad. The mother got a little child defensive. It was an ex.	Not his parents, but I was with my boyfriend's aunt and uncle adult cousins and I accidentally cut my hand and bled all over their white pomerianian. It was fairly mortiftying.	0
What made you stay for too long with a person you've already fallen out of love with?	Change is difficult. I didn't want to hurt her, as she was a great person. The sex was awesome. All of that, and it made ending the relationship worse. Always best to end it once you're sure.	I'm afraid I'm just spoiled and will want out again as soon as I'm in the next relationship. Right now we live together in an expensive area and being separated would make it way more difficult for both of us. I'm guessing the answer for me is to live alone and date around a bit until I find someone who fits but I work from home and know very few people in my city.	1
What is the worst thing you've ever overheard after the other party forgot to hang up, buttdialed, or thought you were out of earshot? How did you handle it?	My parents broke up when I was in high school. My dad moved to a 2br apartment, and I would come stay with him every other week. The divorce was a huge blow to my mom who started dating and drinking a lot. Well, one day I was at the apartment by myself and checking the phone messages. There was this one new message that sounded like a buttdial, but I was curious so I kept listening. I could hear muffled voices. And then moans. And then unmistakeably my mom's voice. She had recently started seeing a new guy, so I'm assuming he was the male voice I could then hear. I'm still not sure if this was unintentional or if she wanted to shove this in my dad's face as retribution for him leaving her. I'm hoping for the former, but it's definitely haunted me ever since.	My ex butt-dialed me once. However he left a voicemail, and in the message he was talking to his cousins about beating some guy's ass. A few days later, he tells me that he got into a fight and I was a wreck. It was the start of me realizing that I couldn't be with this man anymore	1
Women who have become doctors/tried but dropped out,would you recommend med school and why?	I wouldn't recommend against it to someone who wanted to be a doctor, if that makes sense. I don't think it's a career you can choose easily - the money isn't worth the stress and hours of exhaustion, and if you're in it for noble causes there are other professions that can fulfil that noble need without draining your savings and mental health (NB: as much). I would recommend lots and lots of shadowing and work experience. Get an idea of what medicine is really like. When shadowing, try to do a long shift or on call shift so you see the end of the day, shitty parts of it. There are loads of medical specialties and you don't have to know right away which one is the one for you, but it's good to experience them all and understand that there's a big variety.	I considered med school and now I’m in dental school because among other reasons I want a family. It wasn’t because I’m not smart enough, I had a 4.0 in undergrad (you don’t have to believe me, I don’t care, it’s anonymous). I didn’t want to spend 4 years in school then bust my ass in residency when I could love what I do and be out in 4 years, and start practicing and making great money, and start a family after my debt is paid off with my eggs being healthy (statistically of course -lol)	1
What is something that you will always regret for the rest of your life and always deter others from doing/getting into?	Staying in an abusive relationship. Also, completely sacrificing your friendships for a relationship, which goes hand-in-hand with abuse a lot of the time. Staying with a cheater and trying to work it out. Becoming FWBs with someone you still have feelings for. Quitting a hobby or passion you truly enjoy, especially if the reason for quitting is because your dead end job sucks the life out of you and leaves no energy for other things.	Several years ago, someone set off one of those supposedly silent dog repelling whistles. The sound of that thing invaded my bones, and I very nearly threw up. Sister said the same thing. That day I learned that your hearing starts to deteriorate around age 20. We googled why we were the only ones affected and no one else seemed to notice.	1
Fellow men, what the hell just happened?	/r/pussypass in fucking action. No man would have gotten away with that. You should've knocked her ass to the ground to teach her a lesson.	This stuff happens all the time. I'm a gay guy and I had a woman accuse me of staring at her tits. I was just looking around and I made brief eye contact with her and continued on searching for male eye candy. She struts over and yells at me in front of a crowd. Fortunately, a few minutes after she departed, my then boyfriend came back from a nearby CVS, and kissed me on the mouth. The same folks who were there saw that and shifted their eyes towards the woman who quickly gathered her things and slipped away. Dignity restored.	0
Why is _________ still a thing?	Just a reminder, this is not a debate subreddit. Go take a walk outside or something if your instinct is to "play devil's advocate" or argue someone's experiences because you just need to fight.	Just a reminder, this is not a debate subreddit.

What's an 'oh shit' moment where you realised you've been doing something the wrong way for years?	When I was probably about 8 or 9, I found that if I rub my penis on things it would get a nice feeling... that I liked, years later I was still rubbing or humping my penis on stuff including pillows, a mattress, my old sponge bob the square pants stuffed animal pillow, my arm, the corner of a chair in class (elementary school). I didn’t figure out the right way till late middle school....	44 years old. Just realized this year that you can pee in a swimsuit by just pulling the crotch to the side rather than wrestling a wet swimsuit all the way down and back up again.	0
Men of reddit, what surprising or disgusting things have you had to do when you started living with your SO?	same same story. was not pumped for that but really its not all that big a deal after i realized i was being childish. man im commited to this person im active with said person on so many levels why do i need to be freaked out by this. sure i dnt care much for blood but i love the person more then i hate blood. its also a natural normal function.not some icky tale that media drives into ones brain.	The things you see while doing laundry before and after pregnancy; also heavy periods. I know what is happening down there, don't care. I just turn the machine on and forget about it.	0
What is the worst first date you have ever been on or seen?	My friend was asked by a date (very early into said date) ‘Are you on your period? I have this strange talent where I can always smell when a girl is on her period’ She picked up her bag and left immediately.	I took a girl out to a nice restaurant and she starts dropping F-bombs. Well, I cringe and politely ask her to watch her language because this wasn’t the time and place to use coarse language. She refrains from using F-bombs for a little while. Then our waiter comes to our table and asks if we’d like dessert. The dipshit waiter then proceeds to have a long enough conversation with the girl and I’m clearly getting irritated by it. He finally realizes that he’s not there to socialize and goes to get the dessert. Once again, she starts dropping F-bombs and when I raise the issue with her, she starts yelling that we’re never going to see these people again and that I shouldn’t even care. I was freaking embarrassed to say the least. Shockingly, that relationship did not last very long.	1
What is your problem?	I have no idea what I'm doing with my life - I procrastinated too long to apply to some of the schools I was going to, and most of the jobs I am interested in require a PhD. Or a security clearance I can't get due to my citizenship. Or both. So basically I've made a number of *very bad decisions* in the past 4 years because I didn't have a plan, and now it's too late to fix them. Woo! Oh, and my therapist brought up antidepressants this morning. Mostly to tell me it would probably be a good idea, but since I have no idea what I'm doing with my life she doesn't feel comfortable starting me on them because it's quite likely we'd have to discontinue and stuff. *What a time to be alive!*	i am very prone to bad (excessive) habit forming, in terms of food, weed, anything that I get enjoyment out of. "this feels good... why not do it all the fucking time?" is usually how my brain operates.	0
I just found out I have 10 cavities. How has life disappointed you today?	My boyfriend told me he's going to Africa with his family for Christmas and New Years this year. I live in the U.S. and I'll have no way to reach him when the ball drops.	I transferred $4000 to a closed account by accident and now it's gone missing... How can it go to a closed account?? Why the fuck didn't it bounce?? Why was I dumb enough to do that????	0

How have you grown as a person recently?	I'm getting better at letting things go until there's a better or more appropriate time to have a discussion. Basically tabling things instead of hastily rushing into things to soothe my anxiety.	My transition has taken huge steps and given me more motivation to treat myself better every day instead of being so down.	1
Women who live alone, what are some of your tips/advice/life hacks/etc for other women that live alone?	I'm very much an extrovert, so I find living alone a bit challenging. Find scheduled ways to see people in the evening -- TV watching with friends, or bar trivia, or a class, or something. Otherwise, I crave going into the office just so I can have social interaction.	The last thing I wanna do when I'm sick is go out to the grocery store. Keep food on hand (soup, crackers, etc.) that you like in case you come down with a flu or cold.	0
Fellow ugly men of reddit, how did you come to term with your ugliness?	Get a girlfriend/boyfriend that thinks you're cute/handsome. Every day she'll tell you you how cute and beautiful you are and eventually you'll believe that you are these things. Then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks because your SO means everything to you and they are all that matters anymore.	basically stopped giving a shit about it. care about the people who do treat you like normal and i stopped trying to go after girls, maybe if a girl is one day interested in me ill attempt to have a relationship but im not going to go after it myself, although i dont recommend this to everyone cause i might just straight up not be as interested in a relationship as other people	0
Women who cohabitated before marriage, how do you feel about that decision in hindsight?	Marriage is a legal arrangement. There is nothing inherently special about it. Living together in love and cooperation is the thing that is important, and I would highly recommend figuring out if that is something you actually want (by testing it) before you make it a legal issue. I've lived with my girlfriend for about a year now, and it's great. But honestly, if it weren't for issues of maintaining a legal citizenship status (I'm American, she's Canadian), I doubt we'd get married at all. Frankly, not living with someone before marriage is a near perfect analogy for not looking before you leap.	Living with my husband before we got married was the best decision. I got to see how compatible we were seeing each other day in and day out.	0
Ladies who struggle to get dates/male attention, how do you feel when you're dismissed as "not real" or the exception?	This is so controllable it isn't even funny. As a stripper, I can assure you, EVERY WOMAN can get hit on, you just have to increase your marketability.	It makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate the fact that I'm actually jealous of girls who are street harassed because I know that it is an incredibly violating thing but I can't help but think "what the fuck is wrong with me that it isn't happening to me"	0
What was the final moment when you knew you're in the wrong relationship? What was that 'little moment' that told you it'll never work out?	When he told me he lved me... I laughed. Not once did I ok pause. I didn't and never did live him..	He came home from work and declared that some guy “tried to rip him off”. Upon further review.. guy was supposedly one of his good friends, he had loaned him $5, and was pissed that the guy didn’t pay him back that day (on payday). Sounds super minuscule, but it was something so small and he played the biggest victim over it. Talking about how he hopes his “friend” rots in hell, how dare he try to rip him off, “no one gets away with disrespecting me like that”. It was $5 for lunch to a friend/coworker that, in the beginning of our relationship, he had claimed was one of his best friends. That’s when I knew I couldn’t put up with that kind of... whatever the fuck it was.	0
Women who lost/gained a lot of weight or whose physical appearance drastically changed -- how have people treated you differently, if at all?	A few years ago I lost about 70lbs by choice through diet and lifestyle change. I noticed that strangers are much nicer to me in general now (holding doors for me, offering me their seat on public transport, and positive customer service interactions). I've been catcalled at more which I have still not gotten used to. It makes me very uncomfortable. I put more thought into showing less skin now which was something I never really worried about before.	I’ll always be a fat girl at heart.. not literally “fat” but the trauma or memories attached to my past with my weight will keep me humble forever. Lost about 20-30 pounds after high school and also lost body fat and turned to muscle in the right areas.. was always invisible to men in the past and Sometimes I even felt like girls wanted me around to make them look prettier. Now I see that the tables have turned, those guys are scrubs and hit me up randomly, and girls seem envious of my new found confidence within myself. It’s revenge at its finest without me doing or saying anything to them. Oh, also I get job offers much easier than before which really upsets me at times with how society works.	1
What are you still salty about years later?	Being sick the day of the Math Counts competition. I was the fucking captain. My best friend was the only other dude on my level on our squad. Like together we would have fucking wrecked the competition.	My friend from middle school was staying at my house for the night. She snuck in her boyfriend and they had sex on my beloved baby blanket that my grandma made for me. I wanted to give it to my children but now it's tainted in my eyes. I know it sounds silly but it still irks me 12 years later.	0
What do a lot of women misunderstand about the dating experience of the "average man"?	That I actually want intimacy and not just somebody to stick my dick in. How incredibly frustrating it can be when you have to initiate everything and you're not good at it. How invisible you can feel to women who are just as average as you are or even below average. Developing feelings for a female friend can happen very easily and it doesn't mean I was just spending time with you to try and get in your pants.	Most of these responses are about sex.....aaaaand make the dudes saying them look like huge ass holes. Or 17 years old. I would say most chicks don't appreciate the effort guys put in. Women take for granted that they are the desired one in the situation, men are putting in effort for you to like them. So I think chicks are too quick to say "I wasn't impressed" or something like that and move on, instead of saying "he was a really nice guy, maybe a little awkward, but thats not bad maybe he was nervous".	1
Had sex with a girl and didn't call her again. Found out she was upset and feel ashamed. How should I move forward?	She had sex with you without a commitment. You don't owe her anything more than to be polite and maybe don't tell many other people.	Unless you've been clearly expressing the wish to start a relationship, she isn't entitled to one. I would just tell her "Listen, I'm sorry I didn't meet your expectations but I thought we were on the same page. Hurting you was the last of my intentions, I'd be happy to see you again as a friend but if you don't want to I'll understand."	1
If you're a woman making $100,000+/year, what's life like?	I love it, but I'm still not used to it. I had my daughter when I was 17 and never ever expected to NOT struggle financially. I grew up on food stamps and donations from the church, so not stressing about how to afford groceries is a huge shift. I don't know if I'll ever get used to it.	Happy, but I'm a generally happy person who gets what she wants (by working hard and being tough, not by being annoying). I'm not sure if you're thinking the $100k makes a person a certain way...I think I am a certain way and that's why I make more than $100k. Do what you love and don't worry about the money. You could not pay me $1 million to do something I hate for 40+ years of life. EDIT: wow, leave it to Reddit to turn totally inspiring intentions into me being an asshole because I'm not thinking of all the poor people who are struggling and would do anything for money. Oh well, that's your choice.	1
What are some unwritten "Lady Laws"?	Don't mess with another women's SO, or even an ex bf. If you and me are friends and you're trying to hit on my ex. That's a big No No to me.	Thou shalt pretend you know that girl at the bar who is giving anyone and everyone the pleading eyes when some creepy dude is scamming on her and save her.	0
Fellow Men what feminine traits or interests do you have that you tend not to share to fellow blokes?	I almost always sit down to pee. I live alone, so who's gonna know? Plus it gives me a chance to check my phone without worrying about dropping it in the toilet.	I'm a fucking huge hip hop head, but Avril Lavigne is bae. Also, I enjoy shopping for clothes, spend a lot of time trying things on and take quite a bit of time in the morning to look good. I suppose I only really hide the 1st one.	1
Black Women of Reddit: What stereotype geared towards us do you hate the most?	I'm angry. I'm sassy. I'm ghetto. I could be a thief. I'm loud. I'm unintelligent. I'm close minded. I'm spiritual. I'm "manly". The only one that's true for me is that I'm loud lol. And my GOD I hate the, "Wow! You speak very nice. You're eloquent". That's a backhanded compliment; they expected me to sound a certain way JUST because I'm black. =A=; The fuck dude.	the stereotype that our entire being is sassy and ghetto. Recently, I was at a friends for game night, we were playing Uno. I simply but jokingly was like “girl don’t look at my cards” and her entire family mimicked me but made it way more than it was like i had said “GURRRLLL DONT YOU BE LOOKIN AT MY CARDS” when that’s not how i said it... at all.	0
For Women That Barely Date: What Are Your Reasons?	It's very rare that I meet people I'm genuinely interested in. When I do, they're usually friends first that fade into something more. Dating a near stranger for the sake of dating in and of itself is not very appealing to me.	I’m ugly and im transgender. It’s not really my choice not to date. Edit: I don’t care about being downvoted but it sucks you can’t have a negative reason to not date here	1
Women who were forced to carry a pregnancy to term after being denied an abortion (any trimester), what were your experinces and what is your current relationship with your child?	I was the child and my mother and I never had a close or healthy relationship. Lacked affection and much of a bond. Sucks.	Man, all of these stories are nice and all but I strongly detest children, the idea of me personally parenting and am tokiphobic as hell. If I was denied an abortion (which hopefully I won't be, I have a normal period, money saved up, and am a normal weight) I honestly think the shock would lead me to suicide. Even with adoption I don't think I could handle 9 months of pregnancy.	1
What was the smoothest move you've ever made on a woman?	So working at a reasturant thats "down on the farm" on a smoke break with a buddy when a cute server walked out and started talking with us. anyway i finish my smoke and start walking back in when i turn and ask her " do you have any knee pads?" She responds " no why?" So i respond "well you better get some cause your gonna need the." We've been together almost ten years celebrating our third wedding anniversary.	I was having a conversation in a club with this really weird and cool chick and she pulls off a tiny unicorn head plushie from her bag. She told me something like "Did you know that if you grab an unicorn's horn you can ask for a wish?" And I was like "Oh for real?" And then I touched the plushie's horn and asked for her number. She laughed and then gave me the digits. That was the only time I asked for the number of a girl and Im a little bit bummed out of probably never being able to top it.	0
What do you wish women would just GET about men?	That we're allowed to have insecurities and that doesn't make us bad people. No, I don't want to meet your exes. No, I don't want to think about your sexual history. Yes, it bothers me seeing facebook pictures of your past relationships. And no, these emotions don't make me misogynistic, controlling, immature, whatever. **Everyone** has insecurities, that's part of being human. I'm all for managing my insecurities in a healthy way, but it's wrong to shame me for having them in the first place.	The the more sexual partners you have, the less desirable you are for long term relationships. I mean you know it too since you lie about your partner count.	1
Does a woman being interested in you make her more attractive?	Am I at least neutral on her or her appearance? Then yes. If I think she's unattractive, no level of her interest is going to break that threshold.	Yup, this is why more women should go after guys instead of sitting back. You can probably overshoot what you would get by just sitting back.	1
Men who are dating to or married to extremely hot women, what problems do you have to face?	I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance. So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness.	My lady is pretty hot and Im very trusting, but the truth is I get over protective the moment she feels uncomfortable. She has this certain fake smile and awkward laugh and its like my bat ~~symbol~~ signal. Edit: signal	0
What's the WORST piece of advice you've heard on Reddit?	"My boyfriend said something the other day that irked me. It wasn't a big deal but I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting?" "***YOU AREN'T. DUMP HIM AND MOVE ON. YOU OWE NO ONE ANYTHING AND SHOULD STAND UP FOR YOURSELF. BURN ALL YOUR BRIDGES NOW SO THAT YOU CAN FINALLY BE AN ADULT.***" "Thanks! I hadn't seen things that way!"	There's the legal advice thread where someone told the OP to go around and talk to as many lawyers as possible about their divorce so that their spouse couldn't find an impartial lawyer. Which is apparently illegal (or makes you responsible for some kind of damages).	0
What would you respond to men who make comments such as "cover up" and "have more self respect"?	No man has ever said anything like that to me. If I dressed in a way that made them notice they'd just try to fuck me.	Most of the time, ignoring them doesn't work as they take that to mean you've been shamed into silence. This is when channeling Samuel Jackson works best. "I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing."	0
What are some questions you wish you had asked your girlfriend before things became serious?	I'm in the military and I've made the personal decision to not vote in any sort of elections for personal/professional reasons. It came up in conversation because my girlfriend asked me if I had registered to vote yet because I needed to vote for Biden. I was taken aback that she thought she had any right to tell me who to vote for or that Biden was somehow a superior candidate. I tried to explain the situation to her tactfully and she just couldn't seem to understand it. Then I tried logically explaining that having two bad choices with one less worse than the other was not a good reason to vote for the less worse option. Caused a huge fight, recommend you lay your political viewpoints out early because when it comes up it will cause problems if they aren't aligned.	I would ask specifically “are you currently neglecting mental health care and medication recommended by your doctor who has been treating you the previous decade and did you really lose a court case where you stabbed your ex in the chest and ordered to pay restitution and do you still have sex in the bathroom at work with that weird guy Dale you work with”. Honestly would have been a lot easier if I had just asked that up front instead of finding out the hard way.	0

What common misconception within your field of expertise do you want to clear up?	Tipping is not an option. It is customary in the United States to too tip your servers because most of them make $2.13 an hour. Tipping is what allows restaurants to serve you. Tipping is the reason your food is high quality and you get everything brought to you. Servers are already basically catering to your every need and if you don’t directly tip them you are taking advantage of someone.	That lawyers are rich. Most of us who aren't in white shoe firms are certainly not that. Also, a good amount of us fake it until directly called out. Listening to a real estate attorney talking about constitutional law can be as bat-nanners weird as say, a butcher or store clerk talking about it.	0
What fashion trend can you just not get on board with?	NORMCORE. Ugh. I'm tired of seeing expensive dressy sweatshirts every where in stores right now. We've gone from "Homeless or Hipster?" to "Bankrolled or Baglady?". :P	LACE. It was gorgeous when Prada did it, beautiful when the Victorians made it work...But since lace has become popular in mass fashion, it just looks cheap and flimsy and tacky.	1
Women who met their SO after years of being single and almost giving up, what's your story?	Suffered considerable trauma from an ex and was unsuccessful in finding a new relationship for ten years. Then I decided to give Tinder one more try and met my wonderful SO. It's almost like I needed to endure and experience life on my own to become the person I am now. Like they say you can't love another until you love yourself.	Why would I ever try to find someone? Seems awful. We can find each other, but until then, I'd rather be alone. I also go years and years without a relationship, so take that as you will. I'm in a relationship now after about seven years of being single. Had a quasi relationship in that time, but it was only because I got knocked up, I only wanted a few dates with the dude to relieve some boredom.	1
Women who are married/with a SO who's culture and lifestyle are completely different than yours, what were your thoughts and how did you deal with it?	I'm American and my husband is Mexican. I was really open to his culture from the beginning. I've learned to cook a lot of mexican dishes and have been learning Spanish. It's been a lot of fun getting involved in his holidays, music, dancing, and pop culture. There are some things we don't quite see eye to eye on, but we've always been respectful of each other's differences in opinions.	SO is Korean, I'm British. There is definitely some culture clash, he spent most of his life there and is very proud of being Korean. He'll sometimes say something sexist, or slightly racist, and I would call him out on it. It caused a lot tension at the start of the relationship: we would erupt into arguments constantly. It's much better now though, after almost 3 years, either he's changed, or he doesn't bring it up anymore. On the positive side, he introduced me to Korean food! We have cupboards full of Korean ingredients now, I make it for myself even when he's not around.	0
Black women: How do you want white women to be allies, or to be helpful, in fighting racism? Do you want us to be actively engaged and if so how?	Please keep in mind both this question and the rules of the subreddit while replying. This question is "Black women: How do you want white women to be allies, or to be helpful, in fighting racism? Do you want us to be actively engaged and if so how?" Top level answers should answer that question, and then replies to top level-level answers need to be on topic inorder to not be derailing. For example, being a white woman touching other white women's hair. It's an innocent contribution, but it's just not relevant to the discussion. Also, as a reminder, things like dismissing the premise of the question, reporting the question because you don't like that black women have a platform, and outright racism will not be tolerated. Take it somewhere else if you just need to be an asshole today.	Please keep in mind both this question and the rules of the subreddit while replying.

What is it about that "one guy" in your friend group that you can't stand?	He was a good friend of a guy I consider one of my best friends. They'd been friends since elementary school. I always thought he was a douchebag, and didn't give a rats ass about anyone but himself. Well, my best friend's wife walked out on him for reasons that boiled down to her not being happy. Best friend told old school friend to stay away from her for a while, hoping that she'd come back. Turns out old school friend was after her from before she left. Last I knew they were shacking up together. If I came across them burning in a car fire, I wouldn't so much as drink a beer to work up enough piss to urinate on them to put them out.	Nice Guy syndrome. 'Poor people should just work harder' even though when his parents cut him off he depended on everyone else for food, housing, and transportation to survive university. 'The woman in Rum Diaries deserved to get raped because that's what happens when white women hang around blacks'. 'The woman in Irreversible deserved to get raped because she didn't listen to her boyfriend.' Just a general lack of self awareness and social skills. Love the guy though.	1
Do you think female masturbation is a taboo?	Only just slightly more than male masturbation is. People who disapprove of one tend to disapprove of the other, but I think that most grown ups expect that masturbation happens.	If it's wrong...I don't want to be right. I wouldn't say taboo is the word but perhaps "shameful" would be the right one. Maybe your parents catch you and you get scolded. But it is no where in the same ballpark of taboos such as blowing a goat.	1
How are some of you able to wear jewelry specifically earrings permanently, they are so uncomfortable it’s like never taking off your makeup kinds of uncomfortable?	I wear a ring every day. I never notice it unless I take it off for something -- then I check my finger every 10 seconds and feel extremely uncomfortable. As for earrings, I've been lazy lately but I wore them every day for 10 years. I choose small ones that don't weigh much or swing around (usually studs but I do have some dangling ones) so I just forget about them. I can't remember ever even noticing them after the first few months. I think it's just habit. I almost never wear makeup so putting on mascara or gloss will make me very very aware of the fact that I have something on my skin all day, but earrings I just forget.	I'm a jeweler, so I make all of my own jewelry. One of my goals when making a piece is to make sure that it's comfortable :) so the earrings I wear every day are super easy to sleep in, wear hats with, work with etc. and I basically kind of forget that they're in!	1
Gentlemen of Reddit, what's the weirdest reason you aren't someone's "type"?	I treated her too well, she was having feelings (because apparently all of her exes were douche-bags), and couldn't take a married guy home to meet mom.	I was once flirting with a girl in a bar when I was 19 amd she was 20 or 21. The topic of age came up in conversation. She estimated me to be about 23, and when I told her the truth she excused herself and said she would never date a younger guy. I find that a very odd idea, especially given that she clearly seemed interested before when she thought I was older...	0
How can I be sexually assertive without it coming off as pushy?	There's an app called text now. Its free and its basically a new number you can use whenever you have internet. Give him that number. Hook up that way.	If he's within the 90% of average guys, he'll have no problem with you going after him. From a guy's perspective, I wish more women would be comfortable making the first move. Write your number down for him, and say "Call me, let's have drinks/dinner/whatever". You don't have to say you want the D... he'll know. Tackle him at the knees when you meet.	0
How do you guys deal with feeling unwanted?	I still have no clue as to how to go around it. I'm the boy who nobody ever wants to pair up with science practicals. I was bullied and isolated extensively in primary school, and don't really have many people I can truly call friends. A handful at best. Never had a girlfriend either outside of two tries on an app, and am afraid I never will. I don't belong, wherever I go, and whatever I do. I'm OK with being on my own. It's how I grew up, and it's all I've ever known.	You have to learn to love yourself and enjoy time with yourself before anyone else will. Take yourself on a date go out to eat and to the movies	1
Men: what compliment about your body would you like to receive from women?	Here is how women flirt with men: Look in his general direction for 3 continuous seconds. Then just sit back, he will do all the work from there.	Just be honest. Last thing I want is for someone to call me some muscular Adonis when I already know I'm not.	0
How many guys have gotten in an actual fight with a guy because he was messing with your girlfriend?	Once almost, but she started it with this group of guys. She was taking a lot of pictures in one spot so they started snickering at her, so she turns around to them and tells them the pics are not of them so mind their own business. So they mock her going "oooohh scary" so I just say ignore them lets go. Then she gets mad at ME saying why didn't I do anything? I was fucking astounded at the lack of thinking she was using, I was going to fight at least 5 dudes and probably get the shit kicked out of me over pictures. It was stupid selfish shit like that led me to breakup with her later on.	This is a weird question. ”how many”implies you want to know how common it is, but there's no way a bunch of discrete internet answers could demonstrate that.	1
Girls in the US have been getting higher grades than boys at school and university for nearly a century Why Do you think that is?	Women are planners. As a majority we plan for our future where as most men do not look that forward. I planned my whole school life starting in 5th grade. My brother, only 3 years younger, hasn’t planned his school at all and now as a senior has been through 4 different high school being kicked out of 3 in the past 2 years.	My experience as a former educator and childcare worker: girls are more likely than boys to believe they need school to move forward/get ahead. Most of my work was with lower income and middle class students. The boys usually told me they planned to work with their dads/in their dad's industry, or go into the military, or go into sports. Often they do need school for these things long term, but they don't see that early on. Girls were more likely to have a career goal for which they felt they needed a degree and therefore needed good grades. Military and sports careers are sold to girls less often, and you still have less of a tradition in families of welcoming daughters to the "family business".	0
Do you keep getting dumped after few dates? ever figured the reasons?	See, I have the opposite problem. I just want to go on a few dates, and its like as soon as we have sex these girls want to move in. To answer your question though, my advice is don't act like shes doing you a favor to be out with you. You have to play the game a little and appear slightly un attainable for a little bit, otherwise she filters you out because she subconsciously convinces herself shes out of your league.	Nothing goes wrong. You are competing with a lot of guys. What are the chances that you are the best fit over all of them? Pretty low. And you arent getting dumped if you were never in a relationship, so stop looking at it that way.	0
Ladies with breast implants - how did your life change, for better or worse, post-surgery?	Only changed for the better. I had no breasts. Not even AA. I come from a long line of tiny, breastless women. So I got B cups, and I have been happy ever since. I felt like such a child without them. I hardly felt like a girl. I am not ashamed of them at all. If it comes up, I proudly tell people I have implants.	My wife got them a year ago. This morning she came to me and said "It is nice looking at myself in the mirror". She went from having to sloppy hotpockets after 3 breastfeedings to perky 75D's, and to be honest, it is the best 5k€ I have ever spent. She is much happier with her body, and is a much more comfortable being. Bonus-edit: Best thing about them is that I get to buy a lot of sexy lingerie to her - I average one nice set per month that I buy for her. One of my favorite activities.	1
What was your worst "my SO can never know about this" story that didn't involve any sort of infidelity?	I dropped off university. I smoke, a lot more than she thought. I think her sister has sexy boobs & also, amazing 1 of a kind tits. Edit: PS: I know I have friends surfing reddit and she doesn't. Remember the brocodes, motherfuckers. I trust you.	My dog destroyed a pair of shoes she left at mine, so I threw them away. I get a call... "Did I leave my shoes at yours?" "Nah I've looked everywhere, can't find them." Wouldn't even be a big issue if the truth came out, she loves my dog, but I've got my boy's back & I'm in way too deep.	0
Are braless women really that distracting?	No more than a girl with a bra on. My best bud's SO doesn't wear bras and they're a C size. I honestly have never noticed, nor has it inclined me to look any more than I have been to look at any other girl.	Guys are going to look at your boobs no matter what. And depending on a few factors, they might look a little longer if you're not wearing a bra. Don't overthink it though, and definitely don't feel shameful for doing what feel comfortable for you. If that means not wearing a bra, so be it. Any guy that does give you unwarrented amounts of attention is going to have done it bra or no bra.	0
Do you find a person more physical attractive the more you socially interact with that them?	Physically attractive? Nope. That is decided in the first 10 seconds or so of me seeing their face. It can be changed with diet, exercise, or different attire/makeup, however. That said, it is nice to see a girl or boy having a quick whit about them. A sense of humor or a well placed pun will make me respect them more.	Yes. I tend to see the positives of their body more and ignore the negatives. It helps when I can confirm that she doesn't mind talking to me vs. before when I had no idea if she'd be annoyed at my mere existence. This has happened to me with numerous girls at work.	0
Drinkers of AskMen -- What's your #1 sign that you've reached the point of being drunk?	My "tell" is letting out a huge exhale with my lips pursed and cheeks puffed. I have no clue why I do this, and I do this without thinking when I get drunk; when I recognize it, it's my sign to slow down before I say stupid things like "moving around is fun!" in public again.	When I know I can't walk unless I wait a little bit, I stop drinking. Usually that's 6 double tall crown and cokes in two hours, with 2 Redd's up front.	1

What do men like about being straddled by a woman?	talk about trying to get into the head of someone, OPs follow up questions are intense to say the least	Love it. It shows a level of interest that I appreciate, and there's something very sexy about being pinned under her, too.	0
How often do you look at the butts?	Always. And if I fail to notice a good one, my wife will squeeze my hand to make sure I do.	If a nice booty walks past and it’s in my line of vision i’ll peep but i’m not trying to be super egregious about it IE craning my neck. Admiring a nice ass is one thing being a creeper is another.	0
Why does it seem like social anxiety is so common these days?	I'd say its a combination of: * exposure to social media creates warped views on what a "fulfilled" life is * the internet gives shy people a place to vent safely * social anxiety related issues are topical and possibly being over-diagnosed * modern society has shed a lot of culture/tradition that provided regularity and purpose; it it's absence a lot of people are feeling lost and without purpose	I venture to say most comments are completely self diagnosed. It's the victim complex. They want something to blame for themselves. I refuse to believe every other redditor is someone who suffers from depression, social anxiety, has a slight case of OCD, while being an introvert, has a narcissist parent, and also suffers from misophonia.	1
Men in their 30s, what advice would you give to 25 - 29 year olds?	If you haven't figured it out by 28, you're probably not gonna figure it out at the magical age of 32 or whatever 30 number.. By 25 you should pretty much have shit squared away.	Stop treating girls like they're special before they actually are. This isn't to say that girls aren't special, but a girl shouldn't be special *to you* until you have a relationship with her. I spent too many years of my life pining after girls I wasn't dating and who wouldn't date me if I asked. Date first, then find out if they're special or not.	0
What is your infamous "but I meant it as a compliment" moment?	I told my fiancee... "Don't take this the wrong way but I find you stunningly attractive... and it's your worst quality" She's funny, engaging, genius, etc :) She took it the right way!	Wanted to compliment how perfect and clear the skin of a girl I was seeing was. Said "You look like you wear a lot of makeup."	0
Men of reddit, what would be the best way for a girlfriend to express her concerns about the weight her boyfriend has gained? Is there a way to do this without crushing his self esteem?	My girlfriend just straight up told me she thinks I've been gaining weight and what can we do about it. It hurt a bit but I'm no fool I noticed I was gaining weight. I appreciated her honesty	You've gotten really terrible advice in this thread. He knows he's gained weight. He knows it isn't healthy. He doesn't want to be preached at, belittled, or bribed with sex. Lead by example... make him part of the process "I heard about this place __________ where there's a beautiful hike to a waterfall (or whatever). I thought we could go for a hike together on Saturday-- want to go?". Keep him active-- then, as you see he's losing weight, tell him how hot he looks, etc.	1
(Stolen from r/AskWomen) When did you realize that you were dating an asshole?	She got pregnant and we hadn't had sex. She tried to guilt me into paying for the child and then blamed me when she ultimately aborted.	When he would make everything about him when I was bringing up a small issue. Then he’d say I was ungrateful and cuss me out and then ghost me. Would come back a week later and pretend like nothing happened. Apologized for saying hurtful things but then kept doing it over and over.	1
Guys of Reddit, what question do you wanna ask other guys?	Never mind I just realized this is what the entire subreddit is. Edit: what the fuck guys? I said nevermind.	This is a great thread seeing how I'm banned from creating new ones from this sub for some reason (oops). Why am I only attracted to skanks? Last few girls I've been interested have turned out horribly, one getting finger banged by a friend behind a water tower, another I dated an ex-con after me and turned to a life of drugs, and another girl I'm interested in turned out to be a stripper. I've been on dates with "normal" girls but it just seems boring. They have their shit together but there's no excitement or attraction. My brain says GO FOR THIS ONE! But my dick says no. And my heart is dead due to failed previous relationships.	1
What does it feel like to get a girl pregnant?	as a man, having sex with your wife for a planned pregnancy is one of the most demeaning experiences you will ever have. a lot of men will say the same thing	Depends on the girl, I would assume. Me and my wife were trying for each and every one of our kids... so, it was pretty exhilarating. If it wasn't intentional, it might have been more terrifying. I will say that with all of my children, initially holding them was terrifying. It doesn't matter how many newborns I had held, I was always terrified that I was going to hurt each and every one of them. Don't get me wrong, I held them, and I was/am an involved father to three wonderful kids (if you can call a teenager a kid... at least she's not driving... yet). But they are always so tiny, and so fragile. I was always terrified that I would do something to hurt them.	0
What is your experience with getting permanently sterilized when you haven't had any children?	It's fine, I would just say if a person is really young, that they wait a few years to make sure it's something that they really for sure want. I've read that it can be very difficult to get a doctor to even agree to do the procedure for someone so young.	I did it at age 43 or so. Got the Essure sterilization procedure, the same week that folks filed a class action lawsuit against it (sigh). But I've been fortunate - haven't had any problems, haven't had any pregnancies. I wasn't given much hassle about getting sterilized - despite being childless, being recently divorced and in my 40s may have made it less controversial.	0
What is the most uncomfortable situation have you ever been put in- by a guy? Any kind of unwanted flirtation- or something of that nature?	Not flirtation but definitely beyond uncomfortable. Once I was sitting on the outside patio of a coffee shop studying and an older man (50s?) came and sat at the table right next to me. I noticed him staring at me but just ignored him. Not just glances, a straight up staring. Five minutes after he sat down I noticed some fidgeting out of the corner of my eye and took a quick glance. Not only was this man still staring, he straight up starting playing with himself...in public...in broad daylight...5 feet away from me.	I once shook a hand of a male distant friend of mine during high school. He stopped and slowly felt up the palm of my hand asking me as to how do I make my hands so soft. Another male distant friend during high school (As I was wearing a bag/backpack) asked if he could put his hand on my back as we were walking like a couple without the hand dropping down to my ass. I don't entirely remember but I think it was just one of those moves to stick some shit on my back.	1
I'm going to college at the ripe old age of 23, what are some tips, tricks and do's and dont's that I should be aware of?	I can't tell you what I learned from school But I could tell you a story or two Um yea of course I learned some rules Like don't pass out with your shoes on And don't leave the house till the booze gone And don't have sex if shes too gone When it comes to condoms put two on Then tomorrow night find a new joint	Don't tell other freshmen you're over 21 unless you want a bunch of classmates asking you to buy them alcohol all the time	0
Women who love their job, what do you do and why do you love it?	I work for a handbag designer as assistant designer! I love my boss who has been like a mentor to me after graduation. Its a small company so I get to help out with everything from design to social media to inventory. Its a lot of low risk problem solving that I love!	I am a housewife. I love it for the following reasons: 1. Setting my own schedule/routine. 2. Don't have to deal with other people 3. I'm old fashioned and believe it should be someone's job to care for the home. If nothing else you want it to be a place you're proud of. 4. More time with my husband 5. He can come home and rest instead of having to cook/clean/do laundry. 6. I have time to meal plan. Sometimes we don't do that, but it's nice having the luxury. 7. We will have children in a few years. I will get to be around them 100% and not miss anything. There are other reasons I love it. I could write a book, but I don't want to, lol.	1
Have you ever gotten an unexplainable, sleazy vibe from a man who, by all accounts, is well-respected and likable to others? What was your experience like?	Harry Weinstein Olympic Gymnastic Coaches Donald Trump U.S. Politicians Professional Football Players Employers Teachers Educators NFL Coaches Youth Sports Coaches Various Medical Doctors Church Staff Relatives Acquaintances I haven't experienced sexual abuse. We know from the examples above that it always starts with grooming.	Years ago when I was in college, I started a summer job where I worked with a wide array of people. There was one older man who everyone talked about him affectionately, but he just gave me the creeps. He would go out of his way to find me and talk to me on his shift, give strange looks, and offer to walk me to my car at night. Turns out...he was just a really nice older man who liked to talk was very awkward. I finally saw him talking to a group of people and turns out he wasn’t picking up on any social cues, male or female. I really saw how wrong I was about him when I met his wife of 35ish years! She brought him his lunch one night when he forgot it...two awkward and talkative peas in a pod!	0
You just won $1B. What's the most badass way you can quit your job you can think?	I don't have a job as I'm still in school and haven't invested in any part-time vacancies... but even so. (*This is probably going to sound wayyyyy over-the top haha!*) If this happened to me in the future, I'd crash a window in the building, then call for a helicopter to fly in line with the floor level. I'd then call for my boss, who'd hopefully have his jaw strung open like a cat watching a mysterious ball of fluff floating in the air, and throw him my resignation papers, shaking his hand. Then, I'd do an eagle call and jump through the window into the helicopter as it flies off, with a boombox blasting some gangsta-ass music. I'm such a DAYDREAMING loon. :D	I clean at my dad's business. I would give him a couple million dollars so that he can retire I suppose, making me redundant	0
Why is your ex-bestfriend your ex-bestfriend?	We just drifted, no bad blood but after a while we just stopped seeing and speaking to each other regularly.	I joined the military, and he still sits around in his sister’s house smoking pot, working at Lowe’s, and dating a high schooler. I want nothing to do with that.	1
How many pillows do you use?	Generally two, but some nights I'll take one away if I want to sleep on my chest. I have a third pillow ready if I want to sit up in bed to read.	One under my hips and one under my face so I can bite it. Wait, we ARE talking about pegging, right?	1
Jumping off the "period shits" thread--Ladies, what are some body issues no one ever warned you about (and that men don't even know they don't know about)?	Thankfully for me, nothing odd has ever really happened to me. I don't have to worry about being regular, as I've been right on the dot since my first period. The only thing that no one warned me about was how damn horny I'd get the week before my period. >_<	My big one is that no one ever fully explained discharge to me. For a long time I thought there was something wrong with me because my underwear was always gross and crusty at the end of the day.	0
When you go to hang up the phone after talking to your dad, do you exchange an "I love you"?	Never in my life. Since I was 12 or so, I don't even greet my parents. No reason to do it.	We didn't for the longest time. But then, despite him being in very good health, I started saying it when he was around 62-63; because, well, you never know which conversation is going to be the last. We continued that for several years and then one day last June, at 69 and still apparently very healthy, he dropped dead from a pulmonary embollism. I don't really remember the last conversation with my Dad, but I can guarantee you that our last words were "bye. love you. love you too." Yeah... not embarrassed by that in the least.	0
What does /r/AskMen think of this "Peter Pan Syndrome" shaming on men lately?	My main reaction to the link provided is "my God, what a badly-written article." Really, it's a mishmash of half-pursued topics, even leaving the writing itself out of it. I guess some people aren't doing what other people expect of them, basically. There's a lot to pick through in this specific link (I mean, she goes from 'kinda laid-back' to 'dudes with real issues' and back again) but I would put out there the idea that, as in many areas of life, you find what you measure and you get what you reward.	I think it's weird if someone is in their late 20's/early 30s and not putting any effort into getting out of their parents house. It;s also a bit strange if they are not dating or trying to date. I mean, if that makes you happy, cool. But what's going to happen when mom and dad get old and sick or pass away? You'll have no work experience and need to get a job. It won't be a good time.	1
What is your thought process when seeing a picture of an attractive naked woman?	Well that *is* a nice pussy. I don't really have a thought process. I think my mind goes primitive because there's never any speaking going on in there. It's just like... I really like that, she's cute, I'd fuck her, but without words and all at the same time in my mind.	I would tell her that she doesn't have to do this, that she's better than this, tell her to put some sweatpants and one of my old shirts on and that we can talk about who hurt her. I call this the Drake approach.	1
Redditors of AW who went to high school with someone famous, who was it and what were they like before their fame?	Twitch from "So You Think You Can Dance" and a bunch of other dance shows, movies, and Ellen. He was the only guy on the dance team at my HS and got so much shit for it, but he was always really sweet. He was a dance genius back then too and overshadowed all the girls. It's been exciting to see him being noticed for his talent and to see his hard work pay off.	Don't want to give specifics on who but I went to high school in the US with a guy who became semi-famous as a pop star in Europe. In high school he was douchy and always concerned with his image. As part of his quest for fame, he got a nose job and lied about his year of birth on Wikipedia as if he were 4 years younger.	1
How do you deal with feeling like you're behind your personal timeline?	Just wish I decided on my career and graduated at 22 instead of 25. I felt like I lost three years of great income and would be debt free and even maybe $100k in the bank right now. But I know that I was meant to take the route that I did. And if I lost out on three years then who knows how the end of those three years would have really ended.	I used to complain about this to my mum all the time until she told me there is no timeline. There’s however many billion people on the planet and we can’t all do the same thing at the same time. There’s no schedule or timeline. What’s late? What’s early? Compared to whom? Or compared to what? Wherever you are right now is exactly where you need to be and nothing is off schedule.	0
How much time or how many meetings do you need, before you feel comfortable to sleep with a new partner?	I need to sleep with a partner before I can truly have an emotional connection with a partner. I've only had one instance where I didn't and we were together for nearly 4 months before we had sex.	Impossible to say on a generalized scale. I absolutely do require a strong emotional connection before wanting to have sex with someone, but how many "meetings" it takes for that emotional connection to form, really, really depends on the individual case. Certainly would never happen on the first, second, or third date though.	0
How to deal with a friend who lies all the time?	Ok I'll explain this one the best way i can because i do it too, even some of my friends do it. It isn't because they are bragging. It is a way of telling a good story. For instance, If i just tell you i went to the supermarket its boring, but if i were to tell you about something funny or awkward that happened its more interesting. Go look at a couple of stand up comedians they do the same thing. Its their way of giving an entertaining perspective on an otherwise boring story.	OP, I had a friend who had a similar problem growing up. I would always just roll with it, because, what the hell, wasn't a big deal, right? Well, eventually I got sick of it. I went to town on him and brought up a bunch of his lies, telling him that I knew that he was lying and it really bothered me. I told him I was his friend no matter what and if he wanted to lie to other people, fine, but he was never to lie to me again. We had a huge falling out over it and it was awkward for about 6 months. Then we got over it and he hasn't lied to me since. Sometimes, straight up confronting a problem is the only way to fix it.	0
How many cats can a single woman own before it becomes a red flag for you? What about horses? Snakes? Frogs?	Don't know....Depends of the house. Say if she lives in a huge country house and has 100+ cats there, it definitely wouldn't be a red flag to me. I love cats :3 especially furry cats. Horses, no i hate horses, even one is a red flag, they smell bad, always with flys around their ass, plus they're ugly. Horse for me is a meal. Don't know why people have so much prejuducie about eating horse, they taste like cow meat. Frogs are nice, but they're better in a country house as well, in a cool garden.	It's not the number: it's when they start getting unironically anthropomorphised that's the issue. Also there's a difference between someone who owns, say, six horses because she's a horse-nut, and someone who owns six horses because she runs a stable and riding school as a successful business. Also: as someone who owns more guitars than limbs, I shouldn't throw stones.	0
What’s one thing you’ve learned about women that has saved you a lot of stress?	They are bluffing. You let her argue with you. The negative emotion hurled towards you is actually a radar signal to determine how soft you are. I used to have people pleasing tendencies, low self esteem and low assertiveness, this got me burnt by an energy vampire. Never again. Your fear of not getting pussy is the gift of power, if you know what you want, have solid boundaries, and confidence, their manipulation can not work. End of story.	They are far more concerned with their safety than men, first step with all women is to make them feel safe around you.	0
What is your ideal date with your SO?	Always remember to fuck first. You will be way too full and satiated and sleepy after 7 courses and wine. My ideal date would be hiking in the mountains somewhere, followed by a jacuzzi, sex, and a nap, then a tasting menu with wine pairings at a super intimate venue with live music	I can't help you, all my ideal dates (and fortunately my SO's too) involve going outdoors and hiking or climbing.	1
How do I get women to view me sexually?	There's already a lot of 'Lift weights' in this thread. While it certainly helps, you don't have to be muscular to get laid. Being a muscular dude won't magically get you out of the friendzone, because you still won't know how to behave around women in a way that makes them see you as a sexual being. - Be confident. - Be friendly. - Be funny. - **Be flirty.** - Don't put them on a pedestal. - **Be aggressive.** No, don't go around molesting girls. But make moves and make it clear you are not looking for a friend. - Don't be a doormat. €dit: Bolded the important parts.	You avoid the friend zone by never becoming friends with women. I never become friends with a woman until after I've slept with her. Just be honest about your intentions, if you pretend to be her friend, she'll want to be your friend and won't be attracted to you. It's perfectly fine to be friendly, while also expressing a sexual desire, as long as it isn't aggressive. Let them know from the outset that you have enough friends, you aren't interested in being friends, but you are interested in them though. Start of sexual, get to know them after, if it doesn't seem like a good fit that's when you become friends	1
How does AskMen feel about girls flirting for personal gain?	Even her bullshit reasoning doesn't hold up. More often than not, these guys realize after the fact that the woman was just using them to get what she wanted. Once they find out that they've been played, they feel like an idiot and their confidence is even lower than it was before.	It is manipulative but one of the harsh realities of life is that people manipulate each other. Say you are in a relationship and want to go out for a guys night but you know your girlfriend is going to be grumpy about it. So what do you do? You buy flowers, order out a nice dinner and clean the whole house. How is that any worse?	1

What are some tangible ways you reduced your emotional labour workload? What were the results, and how do you feel?	Getting out of retail helped immensely, no need to play that game when you're not expected to put on the happy face to help customers. I absolutely refuse to go into anything similar once I finish my degree, I'm planning on doing more consulting than customer service If you're talking about this new definition of 'emotional labour' aka taking care of family and sharing the domestic workload, well, I just don't choose men who can't take care of themselves. Why would I ever let myself get into that situation in the first place?	I've been trying to do this with my writing group. I'm in a fiction writing group that meets in rooms that need to be reserved at the library. Eventually I realized that, as the only woman, the men in the group kind of expected me to set up the appointments, get the rooms ready, etc. I'm trying to avoid this emotional /mental labor of organization by stopping setting this up but they still expect me to do it. I'm trying to figure out a way to straight up tell them to figure it out or do a rotation etc.	0
What's your favorite type of girl to date?	Lookswise? Short, busty, sandy blonde hair, blue or hazel eyes, my gods, they're a treat to look at and a ton of fun in bed. Relationship-wise? Women who have seen some of the world, who work hard but don't tie their self-worth into their paycheck, educated (and not just in terms of a degree; I'd rather have a girl with an associate's in English or history than a girl with an MBA who skated humanities as an undergrad), yet with a naturally submissive, feminine nature. So basically, a girl-next-door sweetheart with a brain.	The comfortable ones. You know you meet some people and you just feel the need to be guarded around them? And then there are other people where, even if you've just met, you're so much more willing to be open with them than with others? Like, you feel as though you can be yourself and they won't judge you? They're a tough kind to find but they save worry, time, and they're usually just great to be around. The kind of girl where you can just say that stupid thought you just had ("do you think dogs have a favorite type of poop or puke to eat, like solid poos or white ones?") and even if you get a "What the fuck?" look you know she'll move past it.	0
For those over 21, who have a baby face and are petite, when did you feel like you started being treated like a "woman" instead of a girl because of how you look?	I'm almost 26 but without dressing up or wearing makeup, I pass as under 18. I was ID'd for a rated R movie on my 25th birthday. At work is the only place I feel like I don't get treated like a teen because I dress like a granny when I have to be in business casual.	I’ve pretty much been treated like a woman since middle school, long before I was one, because I’m plus sized and very curvy. Being petite doesn’t seem to matter. EDIT: Thanks for downvoting my experiences assholes.	1
Heya Gentlemen, what is the "manliest" movie to come out in the last 25 years?	First one that comes to mind is Gran Torino. Young punk's transition to adulthood guided by the dirty old man next door who is struggling to accept 21st century American life. But I'm sure there are other better examples.	The Grey. Liam Neeson in a hauntingly well acted role trying to get a few men through the wilderness alive.	1
Did you ever start at friends or bestfriends before you started dating?	As a man who is 5'5", I *only* can date people who have gotten to know me. I generally don't like going to bars and clubs to meet people because my tall friends have it so easy meeting people and I'm treated with an uncomfortable amount of disregard. Life on hard mode	We were coworkers that grew to be best friends. We kept each other securely in the friend zone for about 3 years. 2.5 years after dating officially we got married. I always used our relationship as an example of why relationships work out better when the couple was friends first. We never really fought. We had disagreements but we always worked them out calmly. Our similar viewpoints and desires for the future made it easy to combine efforts to reach our goals. We truly enjoyed each others company. We divorced after 11 years of marriage because she was having an affair with her best friend's boyfriend.	0
Who is the cheapest, stingiest or least generous person you know?	Probably me. I don't like spending money on "things". I like meaningful gifts, so I gift meaningfully. Sometimes that means a really cheap handmade gift, or something that made me think of you, but was a $10 gift. One year, I was broke and managed to ten people Christmas gifts for $80. I tried to be thoughtful and get things like a gift card to the movies ($25 for two people) for my sister and BIL with a note that I'd babysit for them that night.	My dad. Whenever we go out to eat he wants to bring my grandma so that she ends up paying for all of us. There have been multiple times that he's complained about things being too expensive even to our server a couple times as if they could do anything about it. But then he will order the most expensive thing on the menu for himself but of course he ignores that logic.	0
Ladies, I just puked in front of a customer. What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done at work?	I was joking around with a coworker while no one was in the store. He said something and I yelled "no one loves you and Santa doesn't exist either!" When I turned around there was a Mom and little girl in the doorway. The girl started crying. I got written up for telling a kid that Santa doesn't exist.	I almost cried in front of a bunch of coworkers in another department. It was that time of the month and another coworker in that same department was being kinda rude (and later talked about me to one of the coworkers in my department, who ended up defending me). All of this on my anniversary... Kinda soured things :/	1
What was your "I can't believe that worked" moment when it comes to women?	After a party, everyone was leaving. Girl calls an Uber, I ask if I can ride share. She says “sure”, and we get in. She asked where I was going. “. Turns out she lives in the opposite direction to me. So I just said, “yours I guess”. She was like, “yer ok, sure”.	High school gf broke up with me after our first semester of college. Panicking, calling, begging her not to leave; nothing worked. We met up on Christmas break back in our home state. Too tired and fed up trying, I walked out of her house and told her I didn’t give a shit anymore (I did). That momentary glimmer of alpha-independence literally had her sobbing on her floor holding my leg from me waling out the door. Why the fuck does it have to come to these psycho mind games?	1
Men of reddit, what are things girls think you care about but actually don't?	I dated a girl that bleached her asshole because she was insecure about its pigmentation. I don't care if your butthole is slightly brown or whatever. Just leave it alone FFS.	Make-up for sure. I could care less if my woman wears any as she is just as attractive without it. Though it IS MUCH MORE important that she keeps a 'good' body shape. Fitness is it, and thin is always in...	1
Women who make six figures, what do you do for work? How is your work to life balance?	I USED to have a six-figure income (about $115k gross) working as a mine geologist. I would spend two weeks at a remote mine working 12+ hours a day and living in a camp they had set up, followed by two weeks at home. It's a good lifestyle for a young person (lots of free time for vacations and enough money to get myself started financially) but I wanted to switch careers and work closer to home. I'm currently going back to school while working sporadic short-term geology contracts.	PM at a mid-size hedge fund. Make well over six figures - I was actually trying to figure out how much I make but because it's so complicated I can't. I work from 7am to about 6pm with a gym break mid day. I usually work half days on Saturday just cleaning things up. I work whenever the markets are open but don't travel constantly like I did when I worked at the bank, so that's nice.	1
Why is it considered shameful to visit prostitutes? Do you think this stigma is justified?	It's seen as shameful because it's basically admitting: >"I can not find any women who want to have sex with me, so I have to pay someone to do it." It's similar (but more extreme) to the stigma that online dating has: >"I can not find any women who want to date me, so I have to go online to find someone willing." Dudes get judged on their ability to attract women and both of the above situations spell out that they're not able to.	Because it is easy sex. Women don't like the price go vagina being reduced by prostitution, and men don't like the idea of other men getting easy sex with hot chicks while they have to work so hard for it. Notice that relatively low priced prostitution with attractive women is viewed the most negatively, while more expensive prostitution is more acceptable. People don't complain about $5000 methed-up legal hookers in Nevada who have to give half their earning to their pimp, oops, I mean brothel owner. They complain about $20 hookers.	1

Would it be an issue if your SO didn't want to wear a wedding ring once you were engaged/married?	Call me cheesy, but I think wedding bands are romantic. I don't see it as cheating prevention, but rather as a sweet gesture, i.e. "I'm proud to display that I'm bound to my SO for life." Yes, it would be an issue for me if my SO didn't **want** to wear a band. However, if he were in a particular situation in which wearing the band posed a danger, then I would demand that he take it off.	My parents have been married 33 years and my dad's never worn one. I don't care if my future husband wears one, because let's face it, a little piece of metal doesn't make a man honourable. I will probably wear one because I get hit on mercilessly.	1
What is a product you wouldn’t think works but actually does?	As naive as this probably sounds, a mousetrap. Until I was in college, I'd never needed a mousetrap before, but one day I suddenly needed one. I went to the drug store not knowing what I'd find, and the only option was the wood slab with a metal coil on it, like from an old cartoon. It didn't occur to me that that would still be an option, but I figured I might as well give it a try. It totally worked. Within ten minutes of setting it down with a glob of peanut butter on it, SNAP! The mouse was dead within 30 seconds. I salute you, inventor of the old-timey mousetrap, whomever you are. No one has bested you yet.	Good dry shampoo. I always assumed it wouldn't do much to help my hair and I now know that was a dark, greasy-haired time in my life.	0
What is one thing your crush did that immediately turned you off?	She drinks wine like twice every other day I first thought it was fancy/didn’t mind but now I’m genuinely concerned	Ghosted for a bit then returned and then ghosted and repeated. First time was a huge turn off and I was pissed to the point of wanting to block her. But I was lonely so went right back at it each time. Should have just moved on after the first time.	0
Guys, how much detail do you tell your guy friends about girls after you've had sex with them?	I have some bottom-of-the-barrel degenerate friends, and I don't hear details like this from them. Worst I will get is unsolicited stories on technique. Women should understand that we know how each other's minds work, and most of us don't want friends imagining a girl we respect even the slightest in that way. In the very rare situations that friends have shared sex stories, it's usually about women they have no respect for and don't plan to see more than once or twice.	I usually share with them if the girl was exceptionally hot, or someone we all know. Btw, I don't believe a damn soul in this thread that says they don't share. Believe what you want, but guys share, just like girls do.	1
(UPDATE) How to tell boyfriend I have cancer?	Please, give us an update every once in a while about your treatment! All the best towards this. life is tough, so are you. *Internet hug from a random stranger*	I completely understand that he's upset, but he needs to have a better stress response than punching things. edit: disagree and downvote me all you want. I don't care. I've been in my share of stressful situations (though not this specifically, yet) and punched my share of inanimate objects. It doesn't help, and thankfully he didn't injure himself. Lashing out with violence doesn't solve anything, and can only make a stressful situation worse.	1
What is the most embarrassing SFW thing you are into?	I'm into ASMR. I wouldn't say I'm *embarrassed* of it, but it's not something I would bring up. If I were asked about it, I wouldn't deny it (happened before).	I listen to a ton of folk punk despite my hatred for the scene and the kids that populate it. Not really that embarrassing, but every thing else I'm in to I fucking rock without a hint of shame.	1
Fellow men of Reddit, how was dating in your 20’s different than dating in 30’s (or was it the same)?	Well, the older I got the more picky I got, and the more baggage everyone had. Mid 20s was more difficult than later or early 20s. At about 22-24 the girls your age are hitched or want an older guy, at about 29 all of a sudden a flood of younger girls want you because you're somewhat established, and they want in on the ride.	The older I get the less I trust or respect women. Dating went from an attempt to find true love to a collection of single moms who come over for sex when schedules permit. I'm sure the women didn't change, just my perspective over time.	1
Which female public figures do you admire and why?	Hillary Clinton. She's smart, passionate, and has worked diligently for human rights and the American public since she was young. She never gives up in the face of relentless bullying, and has held her head high throughout more bullshit than most of us will face in our lifetime. She's been demonized, but I'm pretty sure she'said going to go down in history as a tragedy of partisan politics.	Malala. Girl got shot IN THE FACE as a teen and was like “nah imma keep fighting for girls education, fuk u taliban”. But she even went on a talk show and said if a taliban member came up to her and was gonna kill her she would tell them that she even wants education for them and their children. That woman is incredible	0
Women who don't shower everyday, what is your reason?	**STATUS: Locked for moderator clean-up** We get it. There are many people who cannot fathom other people having habits that differ from yours. However, all of your moral indignation at the idea that other people don't shower every day is not an answer to the question this OP is posing.	**STATUS: Locked for moderator clean-up** We get it.

Women who like their jobs, what do you do? How did you get to where you are today and do you have any regrets?	I own a farm that specializes in diversified livestock. We raise poultry, beef, pork and eggs that we sell locally at farmers markets. My husband left his previous employer and after kicking around for a year we decided to give it a try. It’s been a learning experience for me but no regrets.	Bartender. Decided I wanted to be a bartender, took a job at a not-yet-open chain restaurant location (because they needed so many people, their standards were low and they hired me with no bartending experience) and toughed out the shitty work environment for a year. It looks really good to have a full year at one bartending job on your resume. After a year, I took that experience to get a better bartending job at a nice restaurant, learned how to ACTUALLY bartend (not just shitty beer and premixed margaritas), and used that experience to get a laid-back job that I love. I make about the median income for my area and live well below my means, so I get to spend my money on fun things like tattoos and going out to eat. I regret not getting into bartending sooner.	0
Did you grow up with honorary "aunts" or "uncles" who you are not actually related to legally or by blood? Who are they and how did they come to be a part of your (chosen) family?	Uncle Chuck! He was a regular when my dad ran a gunsmith and sporting goods store. After it went under, they started hanging out at home a lot. Dude was always awesome to me and my sister, treated us like nieces. We are adults now, and he still gets us Christmas and birthday presents.	I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but when I was a kid I was best friends with this one girl, so I went to her house a lot and I always called her parents auntie/uncle. I don't talk to her anymore, but her dad is my dentist so I guess they're still a part of my life today (saving me from cavities lol)	1
Can you tell us about the most inappropriate time or place you were hit on (or the most inappropriate person to have hit on you)?	I was 14 he was my neighbors 24 year old best friend. I was walking down the street with a friend and he yelled from across the street "HEY, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THAT SKIRT". I awkwardly walked faster. I saw him on and off for the next 21 years and last October I married him. So guess it works sometimes. :P Edit: word	My first SO had just died. A week later, his best friend asked if I was over him and would go on a date. What the hell, dude?	0
I just trusted a fart I shouldn't have. Ladies, what has been your most recent mistake?	I'm in NYC and I went to get a pedicure. I instinctively turned on the shitty massage chair and they apparently charge for it. Not a huge fail, but really?	I'm pretty much a failure at most things. This month I put my hand in hot tea instead of the pringles can, accidentally punched my boss in the face while stretching, have banged my shin enough times that I can't really wear shorts, dropped a bodywash container on my little toe, modified a base file on a server at work instead of my private copy and didn't realize until people were saying theirs wasn't working (snuck back into the file and fixed it), deleted the name of a public file and had no idea what it was called so had to leave it named "I'm Sorry".... And I'm only halfway through the month!	0
How the fuck do you whiten your teeth?	Teeth aren't actually supposed to be really white and many whitening toothpastes aren't recommended by most dentists because most of them damage enamel over the years. Real white takes more than a toothpaste too because you have to actually change the enamel colour. That Hollywood smile is obtained by professional tooth bleaching.	chemicals. people laugh at the british for yellowed teeth, and exaggerate it, but the uk has some of the best teeth on the planet, teeth are supposed to be off white or light yellow, your tooth enamel is white, and the dentine below is yellow.	1
At what age were you the most emotionally unstable?	Between 19-21. I was clinically depressed, suicidal, in love with someone who was awful for me but I hated myself so much I needed to love someone. Crying all the time for no reason, lost a ton of weight because I stopped eating to the point that I passed out once in the street. It was a horrible couple of years.	Aren't most people going to answer somewhere in their teens? I know I was not the most stable person at 18. Trainwreck of a first relationship with a girl who suffered from Bipolar/PTSD did that.	1
What do you find unattractive what most others find attractive in women?	Fat asses. I like a nicely proportioned ass but if it's droopy and cellulite-y, I'm not a fan. Also big boobs. There's a point where they start to get gross.	Whatever you call the aesthetic that Kylie Jenner sets as the modern "standard". I hate caked makeup, gigantic lips, and whatever else is a component of that look. EDIT: Holy smokes, this blew up! Good to know other people feel the same way!	0
Sugar daddies, approximately how much money do you give for what in return?	7k to 10k base/month for the good looking ones. There's a subreddit for this stuff. I read it if I want to feel sad.	I've been offered to be a sugar baby basically, and I lol'd. I had no idea what the set-up was supposed to be (I never did it) until I told people later. I value my time too much to everrrrr get involved in this shit. I do know this one girl I used to work with who does this though. She's my age (26), and hangs out with some 42 year old (who looks surprisingly young, I might add). She gets to go to courtside games with him, gets fancy dinners, he buys her designer shit, etc. She claims they don't sleep together, but she is probablyyyyyyy lying. I don't know - she says he just wants someone to talk to her, to accompany him, etc. I don't know if I buy it but it's not my place to judge.	1
What was the most uncomfortable thing you’ve had to do for your SO out of politeness?	Went suit shopping with my SO and his mom and she kept talking to the tailor about how my SO needs "*just a little more room in the package area*" and trying to get me to confirm for her. Like no lady I'm not gonna talk with you about your son's dick but thanks anyway.	Listen to his mother in law talk about my husbands brothers balls (cancer). She asked me to check to make sure my husbands were ok.	1
Your S.O. likes muscular men but doesn't want you to be muscular. What are your thoughts on this?	Some women find big dicks aesthetically pleasing but date guys with average or even below average dicks and it's simply that they find pleasing to look at and nothing more. She could also have zero self confidence and you were way lower on the dating totem than she liked and doesn't want you to get out of her league if you bulk up. If she starts making you feel guilty about getting fit you'll figure out pretty quick which one it is.	How would she react if it was the other way around? "No honey I like your belly-blubber, don't change. Wauw look at her, man she's fit, I just love fit women. What? No don't change honey, you don't need to be fit.." Seriously if you want to get in shape then do it, she's probably just trying not to hurt your feeling by saying you don't *need* to change. I'm pretty sure that if you get fit, she won't complain. Edit: typo	0
Do you think it's necessary to wash your hands after you pee at home?	Yep. I don't see why being at home would make a difference. Do you touch your genitals or wipe yourself? Wash your damn hands. Do you flush the toilet? Wash your damn hands. Do you touch doorknobs? Wash your damn hands. Seriously just wash your hands. I can't believe this is getting asked here again. So gross.	I do. But realisticly, my phone is probably a thousand times more dirty than my hands after touching some toilet paper. So I do it, because it is ingrained and a good way to wash your hands a bunch of time every day, but I guess you could technically also make it part of another routine. I won't change my ways, but I think that washing my hands before I prepare food makes more sense.	0
Men who were falsely accused of something serious, what’s your story?	This dumbass who my then girlfriend and I were good friends with accused us of stealing his glasses. Its was such an obnoxious accusation that we went along with it and said of course we did and well put them on for sale if you wont show up to hang out with us tonight. He came Through that night and yelled at us until red to give his glasses back to him or hell call the cops. He left pissed and I hope that one day he found them and realized how fucking paranoid he decided to make himself look. That was the last time I saw him irl on facebook I kept seeing him poaching our friends	I can't speak for myself but I have a story of my stepfather. My mom started dating my stepfather when he was fighting a custody battle that went on and off for nearly a decade. A year into getting weekend visitation rights his ex accused him of molesting my stepsisters. We had visitations from CPS, the step girls were given rape kits, psycological evaluations and it even went to court. Even my sister and I were interviewed. I remember him coming home and just weeping and the deepest sobbing I've heard in my moms chest after a court meeting. All the accusations were false. The ex just wanted to keep collecting child support for her, later we found out, heroin addiction.	0
Dear sisters of reddit, I am the older sister to a 13 year old girl and I desperately need advice. Please help?	As an older sister to a real crazy one, I can say that you have to appreciate the shit out of her good moments and do your best to ride out the bad ones. It can be hard not to take it personally when she takes shit out on you, but remember that she loves you and she's just high on puberty hormones. Though my sister is almost 19 and she's still a nut case half the time. edit, more advice: Don't try to involve yourself in her bullshit- if she's being crazy, steer clear. It's sort of a big-sister-ly instinct to want to help her with her problems but sometimes it's better to not get involved. If she comes to you with something, that's one thing, but otherwise you should offer your opinions on her life sparingly.	I'm not female, and I'm not a parent, but does it ever work to call bratty little girls on their crap and not let them weasel their way out of immaturity? As in, 'you're being disrespectful, you have no good reason to, and you know it. cut the shit and act like the age you want to be treated.'	1
Women who practice abstinence until marriage, how do you deal with your urges?	I maintain my abstinence by fucking my life over and over again, not exactly pleasurable but it keeps me occupied not to date others.	I reminded myself that i wasn’t an animal and I had control over myself. I can see this is going to need an edit. I am not saying women/men who have sex outside of marriage are animals. I am saying that just because an urge exists, I don’t have to follow it, as an animal would. I have control of myself. I don’t have to blindly follow all urges. That’s all.	1
Do you ever feel like you're living your life to be Instagram worthy? As in, you want to participate in activities that show you have an active social life? How do you combat this?	No. I would like to get my selfie game back, though. My girl friends all post amazing selfies all the time and they're so gorgeous but I just can't be arsed to take the time to snap 100 photos of my fucking mug until I produce something decent.	I deleted most of my social media accounts. "Out of sight, out of mind", as they say. Never looked back.	0
How often should you really shower?	As often as you need/want to. Some people get dry skin if they shower too much, while other people are perfectly fine showering twice a day. Some people like to wash their hair every time they shower, while other people only wash their hair once a week or less. There's no right or wrong way to do it, as long as you don't stink.	LOL the no-shower, no-shampoo movement trending lately is one of my biggest pet peeves! Everyone has a different activity level and some live in warmer climates with more humidity, which just necessitates more frequent showering, period. I work out in the morning (HIIT) and take a full shower before work, and usually will rinse just my body before bed to freshen up. It annoys me so much when people gasp and say “omg washing your hair every day is soooo bad for it!!” when they’re the usually the ones who flat iron daily and color their hair, while I never color or heat style mine. You go ahead and fry your hair and feel better about it by showering once a week if you want, just leave my healthy, soft, nice smelling hair and skin alone, thanks.	1
How do you cope with being "just another guy" in the modern dating scene?	Why be "just another guy" when you can be the most incredible man she's ever met? Don't put yourself down before you've even started.	You're just another guy, but she's also just another girl. Also, as someone who seriously dates multiple people, I think it's pretty shitty that she wasn't open about that with you. I don't think that's necessarily the norm, and I wouldn't accept that behavior from a potential partner.	0
Ladies of the medical world, what's the most odd thing you have had a patient openly admit to you?	I'm a psych nurse. I have countless stories. A fairly recent one that sticks out: I walked onto the unit to start my day and a patient approaches me and seductively says, "Good morning. Did you know I was born in a light bulb?" EDIT: spelling	I'm in labor and delivery. A patient called our triage line for contractions and, of course, was asked to come in to be evaluated. She was a prostitute and stated she was going to have to do "at least some anal" to be able to get to the hospital. She was a well known patient, so we knew she was being completely serious. Yes, these our the mothers of our generation ladies!	1
How do you reconnect with friends after you've isolated yourself due to depression/anxiety?	fuck them... if they didn't care that I stopped contacting them they are not my friends anymore people just care about themselves or someone they can fuck	Start reaching out to them in a low key way and invite them to something concrete. Send them a message like "Hey I know I've been distant lately but I'd really like to catch up, do you want to go grab a drink at the pub/coffee at x cafe/food at x place?". Don't expect too much, some people may not want to reconnect, but I suspect if they were actually your friend before they will.	0
When was the most inappropriate time you've been hit on?	Well, once I was checking to see if a store was opened and this guy pulled up and asked me how old I was..... So I said 12. He looked me up and down and said "nice", then drove away. He was at least middle aged.	In my best friends bed with her then boyfriend. All three of us immediately passed out after a rave and I woke up to him fondling my nipples. I wasn't shocked in the face of seeming harassment (this has happened to me before for fear of saying stop; fear of hurting feelings more than anything because I was much more timed then) but the disrespect aspect towards my friend. Not that she would care, anyway.	1
What frustrates you the most about the dating world?	It's really, really difficult for me not to rant about women's hypocrisy and unrealistic expectations about dating. That's what annoys me the most, but it's a really touchy subject. "*sigh* Why cant I find a nice guy for once." "What about this guy I know?" "Mmm..too overweight/short." *throws hands in the air, rolls eyes and walks away*	I feel like, as a guy, I'm expected to do most of the work -- at least to get things started -- even though I probably care less than most women about being in a relationship in the first place.	0
I'm a man who never approaches women because I don't want to seem like I just want to get them in to bed. What says to you that a man is just being friendly and not looking for something more?	I have had many rewarding and interesting conversations with men I don't know, and the thing that all of those conversations have in common is that the guy never brought up my appearance or complimented me on something physical. In a museum, taking about the artists in the current exhibit; at a fundraising event talking about why we were there and why it was important; in a particularly long queue, talking about the weather and how ski season should be coming up soon, and hey! wouldn't you know we both snowboard. Those are all examples of recent conversations I've had with men I didn't know that have been pleasant and didn't trigger the feeling that I was being sussed out as a sex partner.	Why are you bending over backwards just so that no random woman thinks you're trying to get laid? (Nothing wrong with that by the way). Just be your self and if that's "creepy" to her, move along and talk to someone more deserving of your time	1
What was something about your high school that you thought was normal but now you know it was strange?	All the kinds at my school could sing very well. The entire student body would break out in song and perfectly choreographed dance throughout the day.	There was a cow field next door and the cows occasionally got loose and wandered through campus so we had a designated "cow committee" made up of teachers and administrators to deal with them.	0
When was the last time somebody told you they were proud of you?	Saying you're proud of someone is pretty patronizing. I mean, it's okay coming from a parent. But if my boss or a friend said they were proud of me I'd flinch ask who the eff they thought they were to say something like that.	My wife does so regularly. She actually has a little song she sings, which her mother sang/sings to her. *I'm proud of you,* *I'm proud of you,* *I'm ve-ry, ve-ry proud of you!* *I'm proud of you,* *So proud of you,* *And I hope you're proud of you too.* It, and she, are adorable. That being said, and recognizing that is silly and childish, I do thoroughly enjoy it when she sings the I'm proud of you song.	0
Ladies of reddit, what were your teenage insecurities?	Acne. I swore to God I'd never let my kids go through what I did, and they both inherited my skin. I tried so hard to help them, but it was a losing battle. My mother always said, if you have oily skin, you don't end up with wrinkles. But you do get acne past middle age; not as bad, but yeah.	Hmm well....it's complicated. So I'm trans so my insecurities were...a ton. * Truly hated myself and who I was as a person and thought I had no friends because I truly sucked at life. * Joined theater to have friends and because if I couldnt be cool, I could at least pretend to be a cool person in a script * Joined sports so I wouldnt be such a bookwordy nerd and because I wanted to be stronger. I was ashamed of having such a short and small frame. (which was a blessing when I started transitioning) * And I was also hiding all of my gender related issues. I didnt want everyone to think I was homo. (And now here I am, pansexual trans woman. Surprise!)	1
What makes sex go from good to amazing for you?	When I can tell the noises she's making are more involuntary rather than "we're having sex so these are the noises I will make to keep him informed that I am enjoying myself", if that makes sense. When I can feel her quiver.	When I feel like I don't have a shitton of pressure on me. Sex is too often like having an exam you didn't study for. All stress and nerves. Two reasons for that. 1- I'm responsible for my own satisfaction And 2- I'm responsible for her satisfaction. What her job is I have no idea, most of them seem to think showing up is sufficient. If I get time and opportunity to actually enjoy the act I'm in amazing territory.	1
What is your favorite Studio Ghibli movie?	Spirited Away! I have 2 tattoos of No Face (one is holding Gudetama lmao) and aim to fill my legs with ghibli and other animated icons Edit: The reason why is when I was little I watched the full film in Japanese and didnt understand a word but felt connected to the film the entire way through. I remember the exact feeling and smell of the evening, and when I saw the first spirit boat arrive I had never felt so captivated on a sensory level by a film before.	Ghost of fireflies, spirited away and paprika. I thought the sibling situation during the war was pretty sad but I also remember the music they played during the movie too as a kid. Spirited away felt like a lot of fun to watch it gave me more hope for the better and paprika just felt very magical and colorful. I liked the while dream sequence of it.	1
What's your "screw it all I'm gonna treat myself" meal?	After a really tough/awesome day at work, maybe like once a summer, I'll call ahead to the crab shack. On my way home I'll swing by and pick up a dozen steamed blue crabs. On the commute home the smell is so amazing and the crabs are steaming up the windows. I'll dip my finger in the bag and eat a little of the spicy Old Bay seasoning to hold me over at red lights. Once I get home I put on a ratty t-shirt, line the coffee table with newspaper, and put two cold Natty Bohs within reach. Pop on a movie and start smacking dem babies. Crabs are an expensive treat and usually you eat them with a large group for special occasions. Getting a whole dozen to myself makes me feel like a decadent Roman emperor or something. I cackle like a mad man.	If it's just for me - a slab of sauteed calf's liver with calvados and beef jus, pommes fondant and grilled asparagus.	1
Men who have a smaller than average penis, what's the proper reaction from someone you're hooking up with?	How is “smaller than my pinky” possible? I feel bad for dude. But since he’s an asshole. He deserves to have a babydick. Honestly the best reaction to a baby dick. I don’t even know. If he never told you about it in advance then good luck I think?	I mean... OP, there's smaller than average and then there's smaller than your pinky finger. That's micropenis territory. The chance of it happening again is pretty small (heh), but definitely acting like nothing's wrong isn't the way to go. The guy isn't stupid, he knows what he's packing. If it's *too small*, be honest. Let him know it's not working, so he can find other ways to please you. Toys, his hands, his mouth, etc. Also, check with him to see what's the best way *you* can make him feel good. Communication is the singular, most important thing in any sort of relationship. If you're comfortable sucking his dick, you should be comfortable discussing it.	0
Sexual assault survivors: how open have you been with friends, family, etc. about your experience? How receptive have people been and do you regret either speaking or not speaking up?	I'm public about it on Reddit, but I don't mention it anywhere else, and I barely bring it up in therapy. I never reported, and I didn't because I don't hate myself that much, and I didn't need any additional trauma to get to the same results. I don't feel bad about not letting my family know. Some things you just gotta take to the grave. Unless I see one of them in public, because then I'll be taking the both of us to the grave.	I've never told my family about it, but two of my friends know. If I'm on a social media platform where I can be mostly anonymous, I talk about it. I don't regret telling my friends and I don't regret keeping it from my family. It's been years at this point anyway so bringing it up to them now would serve no purpose other than to hurt them.	1
At what point did you decide "Fuck it. I'm out." with a shitty friend and why?	When her ideas became extremist propaganda. When the people she had been fighting for became the enemy. When the struggle for free speech became the struggle to silence the opposition. When facts were reduced to opinions. When the feminist became the misandrist.	There's a thing that I do when I am thinking of ditching a friendship. I think about all the times I have gone out of my way to help a person or make them happy. Then I think about the times they have done it for me. I often find that my friends are only my friends because I am generous. I seem to attract people who are selfish and/or needy. If I have a hard time thinking of even a single time they have ever gone out of their way to help me or do something nice for me, I start seriously considering severing ties.	0
I feel like I'm 24 going on 18.. Need help on how to snap-to and grow up?	Set reasonable, defined goals and hit them. I will find full-time employment in 3 months, not, I think I want a full-time job. I will move out in 6 months, not, It'd be nice to have my own place someday. So on and so forth. As for your interested and hobbies, don't worry about that to much. They are there for you to unwind from the grind of real life. If it's video games, so be it. Also, ask your dad to give you a kick in the ass. Metaphorically of course.	Finish your bachelors in business and lift weights. This combo will earn you more respect than you ever imagined possible.	1
Women working in male dominated fields, what is the worst thing a male coworker has said to you?	Worst? That's a tall order - I've had almost exclusively positive experiences in my professional life. If I had to choose, it'd be "hurry the fuck up, we don't have all day" as I was churning out something for a deadline. Not even bad at all, he says things like that to all of us, it wasn't directed at me as a woman at all	I worked in construction for a couple months. The worst was my coworker telling me about all the prostitute sites he's been on and seeing if I'd be interested in something with him. The worst part was once I put in my resignation my manager declined the validity of my statement and that even women ogle guys like Brad Pit. And that he was sure all the guys considered me like a daughter. Then he gave me an awkward hug. I was so pissed. The owner gave me my two weeks off, paid.	0
What was the reason you walked out on a first date with someone?	She said “you know what, this date is over. I hope I never see you again.” So I told her “fine, then I’m leaving!” I don’t think she could hear me by that point, but whatever.	I went on a date with a guy once to a park. He ended up throwing a baby swing at me while i was on another swing. He did this because he wanted to get on and i wasn’t getting off fast enough. After i walked away and told him not to contact me, he thought that sending a dick pic would be a great way to say he wanted another date.	0
Besides Reddit, which social media sites do you like and why?	Twitter is essentially dead. Even when it was more popular I found it boring and frustrating to deal with. I just use Facebook because it's super easy to use.	Any social media site that I can avoid people I know in real-life on, such as Twitter and Tumblr and Reddit. I can vent or post about anything I want and I don't have to worry about people I might run into out in the real world knowing stuff about me I'd rather they not know. I find the only way to do this on sites like Facebook is to just not post at all. I'm a very private person and I wouldn't even want people knowing my base interests. My closest friends know my Twitter and Tumblr accounts, and they're about the only people I feel comfortable sharing anything with.	0
There seems to be a big societal push for more women in STEM fields. Why isn't there a similar push for men in education &amp; health fields?	Because there's this myth, still, that women are under-represented in education. Even though women hold more college AND graduate degrees, graduate AND are enrolled in college at higher rates, have entire departments dedicated to studying their (our?) gender, and a myriad of other things, higher education has a hard-on for women (bonus points for being a 'woman of color,' in my hispanic-lady-experience). If a woman goes into STEM, she faced adversity to do so, so the mindset goes. If a man does the same in an education/ administrative one, there is no such belief, IME. Women receive more gender-based scholarships and have more out-of-classroom support, yet are *still* thought to be systemically oppressed and face all kinds of 'barriers' in education.	Men are already in health fields. The reason for men being shut out of female-heavy jobs is that the women don't want men competing for their jobs. They want their jobs, and they want our jobs.	1
Ladies, how do you deal when people ask you unwanted questions regarding your plans for the future?	Phew, lots of angry responses in this thread. I just answer. Examples: When are you having kids? I'm not sure, but definitely not anytime soon. What are you going to do after you graduate? I'll look for a job in [industry]. Then, if you want to, change the subject or ask about their life. People who ask these questions are just curious about you and your life. If you barely know the person, you can be vague, but there's no reason to be rude in response to a simple question. If the person starts judging or prying, you'll need to be more firm, but being snarky right off the bat is just unkind.	Back when my husband and I first got married, we were constantly barraged with, "So... when are you going to have kids?" Then we actually did have troubles conceiving so it got harder and harder to hear the constant questions. Finally, "Well, we would have kids if he could just figure out what hole to stick it in." Shuts 'em right up.	0
AskWomen, what's your favorite way to live frugally?	I don't live frugally, I spend all my money and I own a credit card. It's dangerous. But I do attempt to look for all the specials, when I shop online I go to the sale section and scroll each page about 10 times. I do attempt to avoid full priced items if I can. I like to get more for my buck yanno?	I live in a tiny apartment. It's 460 square feet. I could afford something bigger, but why should I? For just me, it's got enough room for my stuff - plus, it's less space to clean!	0
What are some subtle signs that someone is merely tolerating you?	Doesn't show a whole lot of interest in conversation (not reciprocating in asking questions or continuing the conversation), favors interacting with other people besides you, and doesn't make an effort to see/hangout with you.	The corner of their eyes tighten when you talk together. It's very subtle but even with a friendly expression the eyes always tighten if the person doesn't like who they are interacting with.	1
What are some good ways to casually see if a female friend is interested?	Ask her, via text, if she's into you or wants to make out. If she says anything but "Yes!" just say "oops that as my friend haha lol heh".	We went to an amusement park and a concert together on Sunday and had an incredible time. The feelings took me by surprise, caz I’ve always just seen her as a friend. We’re hanging out this weekend again so I’d like to see if she’s feeling the same way	0
What is your passive income stream?	I make dog birthday cakes. Well, I've made *one* dog birthday cake. It's fun. After materials I profit a whopping $25-$50 dollars, depending on the concept of the cake. I also make menu plans. I only have 2 customers, but they pay me about $50 for a general plan. It's time consuming because I have to get a lot of health history and I do it all VIA e-mail. If they want to meet in person they can, but people seem to not have time for that, so if they fib about their height, weight, measurements, activity level, etc. my plans aren't always effective. Then they need to you know, actually follow through with them.	I make apps and put ads in them. I make about $5/year from that. I'm a (not very good) photographer. I've submitted some photos to stock websites. I've made about $2 so far. Rakin' in the dough.	0
When it comes to dating/relationships, what was your "I just hit a one-in-a-million jackpot" moment?	When I was looking at porn this morning with a blonde and a redhead getting DP'd, and I realized that the feeling I was experiencing was nostalgia because she's in Florida for a week. We did that just a couple of weeks ago, and now the thing that was one of my fantasies is a happy memory of how hot my SO is. Makes me happy that I'm dating a smart, loving, beautiful, wildly sexy woman.	Made a profile on OKCupid. Messaged 1 girl, nothing. 2nd girl I messaged ended up becoming my wife. She was about to delete her profile and saw my message.	0
What do you think of Gloria Steinem's statement that women who support Bernie Sanders are doing so because they want to please "the boys"?	It's pretty fucking irritating when anyone assumes I do anything to please the boys or be like the boys or some nonsense like that.	No, no, no! I don't support Hillary because she's just like all the rest of them. Washington has changed her. Yes, I think Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents our country has ever had. I think a lot of that had to do with the time during which he was president. I do not think Hillary could replicate what Bill did. As a NYer, I know that she just used my state as a jumping off point for her political aspirations. She didn't give a shit about us. Bernie Sanders is, I think, the only politician I would ever trust. If he said the sky would falling, I'd definitely run and hide. I honestly don't think he would lie to us. He's walked the walk. And, he'll keep walking the walk.	1
My girlfriend seems to love attention from other guys. Is this normal? Harmless?	If it's making you feel uncomfortable, she knows that it makes you feel uncomfortable, and she continues to do it...it's not harmless. That's immature, and disrespectful. If she feels like she has to hide things from you, that's cheating. Period. Let her know you don't like her flirting, "harmless" or not, and if she continues, dump her. She can apologize until her lips fall off, but it's obviously not genuine if she keeps doing it. Actions are stronger than words, and this is a fine example. I wouldn't put up with any more if I were you. *ninja edit* >Some girl friends of mine told me that a little flirting is harmless True, flirting here and there is just human nature. However... >has told me she's gotten numbers, but not who from, to get a rise out of me when she hasn't. Not okay.	I'm really curious as to why her number of sexual partners / *kissing* partners (are we 16?) are remotely involved in this. You should edit that info out, it's irrelevant and I immediately assumed you were a controlling D-bag.	1
What do you think about dating someone a lot wealthier than you?	I've done it. I'm from a VERY poor family. Girl had a multi-million dollar trust fund and was set for life. She had multiple condos in fancy areas of LA. I couldn't hang though. I knew I was pretty much there for the sex. Sample situation: I sent my younger brother a few hundred dollars so he wouldn't go hungry while waiting for his financial aid check. I then listen to her express her appreciation for what her pet psychic told her about her dog for $600. She was also very paranoid. If I didn't text/call her for a little while (few hours) she would frequently ask who I was with and whether or not I was sleeping with them.	Knowing if I ever had kids with them I wouldn't have to worry about my kid's financial stability would be nice. Don't really care either way. Presents from her would have to be meaningful or made by her I guess.	1
If you were given one free pass to lose your shit on someone for anything, no matter how minor, how would you use it?	The harambe shit. Not the dicks out thing, your dick should be out for the rest of your life to remember that magical gorilla. I mean the angsty mourning. No one knew who harambe was before he was killed, acting like someone murdered your spouse for a laugh isn't going to bring him back and no, for fucks sake, you probably don't care about the gorilla more than its handlers did or have a better understanding of how to handle that situation.	My brother. He went awol from our family a couple of ywars ago and married this absolute cow of a woman. I'm not sure what was happening in his head but he called my parents and started abusing tbem over the phone. They hung up and didn't answer his calls anymore. He called again and left a message My mum played it for me and I nearly left then and there to kill him. He raved about how my dad was a spineless cunt and mum was a fat bitch, that my grandfather would roll over in his grave (my parents did nothing). He's been more than a fuckup his entire life, a million chances given and all of them fucked away. So if I had one shot, no consequences. I would tear out his fucking heart.	0
Is anyone else super turned off when men list "not crazy" as one of their requirements for a romantic partner?	I think it's perfectly reasonable. I'm a lady and listed "no scumbags" on my Internet dating profile. I'm just tired of dating scumbags and I'm sure most dudes are tired of dating batshit crazy ladies.	Yes, because it's tacky. It gives me the impression that he sits around with his buddies and talks about how 'bitches be crazy'. If we have a disagreement, I feel he'd be more likely to dismiss my viewpoint on the basis of that I'm a woman, and women are certified psychos. I try to see people as individuals. If a guy has a not-so stellar moment, I don't automatically assume he's a jerk or an asshole. I don't want people making assumptions about me based on a characteristic that they think is inherent to my gender.	0
Children of parents who fight a lot, what's the most ridiculous thing your parent has told you after an argument with their spouse?	My mom and dad came home after a day out and were arguing about something and it was a pretty bad to the point where my mom was crying and she said to me, 'One day it might just be you and me'. I never thought my parents would get divorced and I was about 9 so I cried. The next day my mom and dad made up and my mom told me to disregard what she said.	This is going back to the 80s. My mom used to tell me that "Kids need a father, that's the reason I stay with him." Which to 8 year old me meant "You're the reason I'm so horribly unhappy." My childhood sucked and I'm pretty sure it's why I have no romantic life and very little social life. What I learned about romance and marriage and such turned me off from women in general. And unfortunately, every woman I've ever dated or tried to date reinforced the notion that I'm just not cut out for love.	1
What are your tips for getting out of a funk?	The hug is pretty powerful. Hung out with a girl late at night one time. Just cuddled in the cool breeze for hours. ... Couldn't sleep for the next few days afterward, lol !	I read a book once that taught me about the value of going on alone-dates. Take yourself on a date, totally alone. Explore somewhere new, see new things, get a new story you can tell to someone else - because they weren't there to see it. Learn to listen to your own thoughts again. Enjoy space. These 'dates' will always get me out of a funk.	0
Women of Reddit who have been successful in love, what would you tell your younger selves when you were single and feeling all alone in the world?	Here’s some cliches that young me needed to hear: - Stop chasing people who are running from you. - stop trying to “save” people. Broken people will only break you - don’t set yourself on fire to keep others warm	Dogs will give you the unconditional love that you're trying to get from a boyfriend and vibrators will give you the orgasms that you're trying to get from a boyfriend	1
What's one aspect of dating men and women, respectively, fail to understand or come to terms with?	It's tough both ways. Men have to deal with the problems that come from approaching and projecting an attractive, confident personality and dealing with inevitable rejection. Women have the problem of trying to filter the men who *do* approach them for one who can handle her particular brand of crazy and/or bullshit. As much as it sucks sometimes to be the one who has to put his ego on the line, I'd hate it even *more* if the only way I had to filter was to choose from the ones who approached me.	sometimes things just don't click. you're not a bad person, they're not a bad person. it just didn't work and that's ok.	0
Intersectionality: How are men oppressed in our society?	Short answer: Men are not opressed. That however doesn't mean that there are issies that exclusively plauge men and those need to be adressed.	I think men are expected to take anything a woman throws at them, no matter how horrible it might be. But if the roles were reversed, society would expect women to react immediately at the first sign of "abuse" followed up with swift justice. I get it, women have gone through a lot and I hate it when I hear stories of abuse towards women, but it happens to men too and society needs to realize it's a lot more serious than they realize.	0
How normal is it for a girl to NEVER initiate anything during dating? How do I get this girl to be proactive?	Bitch, she aint into you. Think about it like this. Let's say you were a really hot guy (ex. Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, etc.), do you not think she would be eager to text and initiate plans with you?!? She's not into you - move on.	ITT: The behaviour that she's showing is either clear evidence that she's into you or clear evidence that she isn't LOL	0
How many push-ups can you do in one set?	On my own free will about 40. If I had an grizzly old boxing coach screaming in my face, and a hot girl watching, maybe about 60.	It's funny to see people with ranges of 40-80. I'll bet an asscheek they're glorified dips that you just happen to do at a slightly more horizontal position than usual. Here's a suggestion: do a bunch, write down the number. Take some rest, watch how to do proper [push-ups](https://youtu.be/aSkD88NciQY) then post the new number. :D Edit: [Another tutorial to crush your ego](https://youtu.be/WpobgeNpOCI?t=10s)	1
What's the worst thing you've ever said to someone who had a one-sided crush on you?	Nothing. Not saying anything hurts the most, as it leaves said person in a state of confusion. Plus, it wastes both your and that persons' time.	Something along the lines of "I hope you die of cancer" while cuddling on a bench in a park. Yeah I am mostly just sharing this story because it sounds really weird I guess.	1
What was a small habit you adopted that made the biggest difference in your appearance and well-being?	Not so much one habit, but many habits that I slowly dropped over time. It started with cutting out soda and candy, and over the course of about two years turned into what I can honestly say is an almost completely healthy diet. I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off effortlessly for 14 years. I think making small changes on my own time instead of changing everything at once was my key to success. I gave myself time to focus and adjust to each small change, so I was never overwhelmed or felt deprived.	Working out. Especially running! It lifts your booty and flattens your tummy and fixes your posture so your boobies look perkier lolz.	1
What are your thoughts on seeing your engagement ring before the proposal? Would it ruin the moment when it actually happened in any way?	My husband and I picked out the ring together. When he proposed two months later, I didn’t even see the ring; I was just so excited that he was asking! I don’t think I really looked at it until someone else asked to see it.	I’m picky, especially about jewelry, so I’d probably mention styles I like vs. styles I don’t like, and then want to be surprised. And maybe suggest people to help him 😂	1
Why are your asses always exposed when you bend over?	I see no other explanation than them being filthy sluts who are begging me to drop coins in there. Copper for my coppertone baby.	Probably for the same reason women have 137.5 pairs of shoes on average. Just answering a gender generalization with a gender generalization (in case all the feminist snowflakes didn't get the sarcasm).	1
Would you side with the Jedi and the light side of the force, or the Sith and the dark side and why?	I have no idea, as I am a 43 year old man who has never seen a Star Wars movie. Yes, really.	I personally find both too constrictive and unnecessarily blind to other aspects of the force. I'd definitely be a Gray Jedi if possible. There is no Dark Side, nor a Light Side There is Only the Force	0
How do I politely tell a guy that I don't want to sleep with him on the first date?	I hate this world. This behavior is normal and don’t let them tell you it isn’t. Why should you *have to* politely tell him that you don’t want to sleep with him on the first, or even second date. These days it seems like they just want to use our body and we are so afraid to be honest about needing more time because we are afraid they will leave. Someone that has suffered sexual abuse I find it impossible to have a relationship with anyone because it’s always them demanding sex before I’m even comfortable with being around them. Men in my experience are way to fast.	Unfortunately, you might have to be straightforward. Tell them you’re not willing or conmfortable on the first night. If you’re still interested in them though, I think you can still tell them how much you enjoyed yourself and would like to go another date. If they keep pushing/pressuring you, end it. It sucks, but you should never feel you have to be pressured into something you don’t want to do. Also, sex does not have to equal being in a relationship. Your friends have the wrong mindset.	0
What do you all think of nipple piercings?	Nipples are so good naturally, I don't think altering that beauty is a great idea. I generally hate piercings, it's a major turnoff to me. To me, only cheap slutty girls have nipple piercings. I mean why would you get one if not to show it? If it improves your own confidence, go for it, but know that a lot of men won't see it as an advantage. Many will be indifferent because, well, boobies are boobies no matter what, right?	I'd say that opinions are going to be 50/50, so it's up to you. Personally, I don't like them. They just get in the way. My SO had hers taken out recently after 14 years of having them and I'm a lot happier without them there.	0
What fanbase prevents you from being a fan of something you would otherwise enjoy?	I really enjoy both Harry Potter and Doctor Who, but I actively avoid interactions with fan-based stuff because people take it way too far. Can't I just like something for what it is without dissecting how it's connected to other things in some obscure way?	Nothing? I could care fuck all for the fans of movies or books or games, regardless if they're annoying or not. I like what I like and I don't really care about the people who like or dislike the same things.	1
Ladies who like to hang out in AskMen, what is the one quality that can take a man from a "maybe" to a "yes" in your eyes?	Everyone's classified as a maybe (including the hot ones) until I know they see me as a person as opposed to an object. Also sentences like "rape is wrong" seem to be a decent indicator, you would not believe how common it is that guys think rape is okay! Oh, and of course, those lovely words: "I never want kids".	There was a guy I was somewhat interested in, then I saw him dance. I was like, I'm gonna get me some of that. Thought it would be my first summer fling, but we've now been together eight years.	0
Stolen from ask men: What is a something about your partner that you are able to tolerate but you are sure the majority of others wouldn't?	He makes terrible jokes. We’re talking sitcom Dad level puns. Usually I find it cute, but occasionally I wish the ground would swallow me whole out of embarrassment.	My hubs has anger problems and is very aggressive. For the most part he is not abusive with me or our son but at times we had have fights. We haven’t had a fight in over a year. It’s less intense now that we are both heavily medicated. But during our first year together I contemplated leaving several times. Aside from his anger isssues, he’s the person I have had the most compatibility ever: from musical taste to sex. He’s also my second husband, btw.	1
What's the most enjoyable PS1 game that you played?	All of the Crash, Spyro and FF games for the PS1 are fantastic. I still replay them every now and again.	PS1 was really the last time I played games back in high school. Twisted Metal 2. Resident Evil. Bloody Roar. Parappa the Rapper. Tomb Raider. Darkstalkers. Street Fighter Alpha. Back then I obsessed over game art as much as I did comic book art. But, once I discovered girls and started getting laid, I stopped caring about games. Which was natural. Back then games were intended for kids and teens. Not grown-ups that compared them to movies. It was something you grew out of.	1
What do you like and dislike about the way your parents raised you?	I was safe, well-fed, well-educated. But I was also made very aware of my mistakes, taught not to think too highly of myself, and trained to think of myself as just a bit disappointing.	My parents spoiled me too much which at this point of my life sometimes can be good some others not so much. They gave me free will, which I respect, made an independent woman and have always supported my decisions. But, I am selfish and way too opinionated	1
What has changed since you went from "girlfriend" to "wife"?	Absolutely nothing. We got married in January for insurance purposes, had been together for nearly nine years, and had lived together for about six. Everything is the same, except that our relationship is just like everyone else's now. I always kind of preferred not being married. I felt like it was special to have such a strong relationship that the government didn't have their fingers in.	Other people seem to take our relationship more seriously and have more respect for it, whether it be friends/family or random people who may hit on either one of us. I've never met a guy who cared when I've told him I have a boyfriend but they tend to back off when I tell them I'm married. Plus, I know it's stupid, but I feel a little more special and confident in our relationship. I like being introduced as his wife rather than his girlfriend...oh and I also like being covered on his health insurance lol	0
CNN just fired comedian Kathy Griffin for her "anti-Trump" photo shoot. Do you believe she deserved to be fired? Did she go too far? Or are public figures fair game for just about anything?	I thought it was pretty fucking funny, but I can see why CNN wouldn't want to be associated with it.	It's not the fact that it's Trump's head that pisses me off it's he fact that it was a recreation of an ISIS photo. Completely insensitive and too far. Should she be persecuted for it by the government? No. Freedom of speech. But that doesn't mean CNN doesn't have the right to fire her.	0
In your opinion , do you wish you postponed having children to a later age , or would of you started having children at a younger age ..and why ?	The world is overpopulated as it is. You should adopt. Your age is more or less irrelevant. If you are financially stable and ready for adoption your application process will reflect that.	Father at nineteen. I love my son to death, but I should have waited. Wrong woman to have a kid with. Couldn't really be the dad I wanted because I couldn't really provide for him without the education I couldn't get at the time.	0
When does a breakup hit you the hardest?	It hits me the hardest when I finally take a look at my other dating options/revive the online dating profiles and remember how bleak it is out there.	I'm a girl but I feel like I respond slow, I'm just numb. Yesterday, actually, my boyfriend and I were arguing - it was me, calling it quits... He was so so upset that I felt like the bad guy and later we made up. I feel really guilty but I wasn't in the wrong but I admit I regret calling a break up without the balls to go through with it.	1
What would you warn young men about women when advising them about dating?	Love her but don't trust her - women are often ruled by emotion and there integrity is based in the moment unlike men who are loyal like dogs	Don't depend on anyone else to make you happy. Don't worry about what others think of you. 20 minutes with a condom is better than 20 years of child support and baby mama drama.	0
Ladies who use dating sites, does it bother you when the person messaging you didn't read your profile?	It's a signal that I'm not going to respond to them. Other things that will cause me to not respond: - Poor quality pics: eg. group shots not indicating which one they are, only extreme facial close-ups, only pics from a distance so you can't see their face, only angry face pics. - their profile isn't filled out or only includes clichés ("I hate writing about myself" "want to know something, just ask") - the message they sent is only a single line ("hey" "what's up") or is obvious copy/pasta.	Makes sense that it would be irritating, but when a guy knows full well that maybe 10% of the no doubt *many* people who he messages will respond, hopefully in a way that encourages more conversation, reading every single profile and crafting the perfect message for every single person is exhausting.	1
What do you want for your birthday?	I really want to take carpentry classes. I've recently started doing some light carpentry work, and I want to gain some more experience so I can start making my own furniture. Plus it would be a fun thing for me and my SO to do together.	If you're stuck on what to get someone get them a small stuffed toy or animal. Me? I want a car broom broom. Bday in 2 days whoop.	1
Ladies who have gotten out of a toxic relationship, how did you do it?	I pried to God to send me a sign/something which give me the ability to say : game over. The next day, the thing happened. And then I refused any contact (phone, visit, etc?) from that person for at least 1 month. It worked. Thanks, God! I believe God exists and if we really really want something, it will happen.	I was with a horrible guy in my teens, super emotionally abusive. At some point, his jealousy got so bad that I physically screamed when I recieved one of his texts and I threw my phone against the wall. So out of character for me. I then thought, it's been three years and he brings out the absolute worst in me. I stopped responding but I won't lie - it took *years* to fix the mental damage he did to me. Last year I started dating a guy, but saw the same signs... The jealousy, the gas-lighting (along with an alcohol problem). I'm older now, smarter, I can see the signs and I've worked too hard on myself to go down that road again. I ended it after three months.	0
What are the most common misconceptions that men have about how women experience sex?	I always find it funny when I come across a guy who legit thinks that women don't enjoy sex and use it for manipulating men. My automatic conclusion there is that he's horrible in bed, ha.	This is a good post, but I honestly feel that most men on this subreddit are probably already aware of most of if not all of these bits of information. That being said, still good to hear again.	1
Alrighty, what's the most depressing, single man meal you've made?	I was too lazy to do the dishes so I took my box of cereal and gallon of milk. Took a handful of cereal, put it in my mouth, chugged milk. Ate the whole almost new box of cereal in one sitting.	I don't understand what being single has to do with it, do coupled men still expect women to cook for them? What year is this?	1
Guys who have dated someone who you weren't fully physically attracted to...how did it affect your relationship, and how did your attraction to them develop over time?	Felt like I was just going through the motions and dating just to be dating. Looks aren't the most important aspect of relationships but there has to be a level of physical attraction that draws you to the girl. Without the sexual attraction, what you've really got is just a friendship.	Erectile disfunction. Cheated on her. Made her dress up in specific outfits, but that’s a thing anyway. Frankly, I’ve dated uglier girls that I like personally and thus found beautiful. Men see beauty where we want to.	1
My cats are plainly tired of me asking them if they are silly cats. What kind of conversations do you hold with your pets?	I have a rescue kitten with clear abandonment issues so I try to talk to her as normal as possible. Mostly I just ask her where her toys are, because she keeps hiding them. I'm also raising her bilingual in german and english.	My guinea pig picks what movie we watch. I hold up a bunch of movies and whichever one he smells first is the one we watch. Based on his track record, he's a big fan of Guardians of the Galaxy.	0
What are your tips for good Sex?	Why does the word 'slut' keep getting thrown around in this thread? Not trying to start a feminist argument here but why doesn't that rule apply to men in this context? Enjoying sex makes a woman a slut? Since when?	Build some tension. I'm a big fan of the slow play. Especially on the weekends tease her throughout the day. Side note: only works if you guys like each other. Doesn't work with casual arrangements.	0
What are some negative traits you have but secretly like?	I'm extremely negative and introverted. I actually really like this about myself. I am able see what a lot of people refuse to see or acknowledge. I can see things for how they really are. I like I am a quiet observer and no one pesters me or expects anything of me.	I'm apparently a bit scary and standoffish which sucks when it comes to meeting new friends but is the best thing ever for teaching rowdy teenagers. I once silenced a dining hall full of kids by drawing myself up to my full height and looking at them.	0
Guys who have been lifting consistently for a long time, what does your diet look like on a day-to-day basis?	After morning workout: whey protein mixed in milk/soymilk Before leaving for work: protein smoothie (consisting of banana, yogurt, a little egg white, cereal, milk/soymilk, peanut butter, and almonds/walnuts) Lunch: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; gulp it down with a bit of fruit juice Dinner: 1-2 chicken breasts + brown rice with veggies; with this I have a green smoothie (consisting of banana, carrots, broccoli, celery, red lettuce, and a bit of fruit juice). Before sleep: some cottage cheese (I don't always have this though)	Shitty mostly. The lifting I can do, the diet I suck at. I generally bake chicken, cut up some broccoli and carrots and mix it with rice with some teriyaki sauce. Pretty good stuff. Breakfast is typically oatmeal with some cinnamon and brown sugar. Then dinner usually varies. Last week it was pesto chicken with veggies. Sounds healthy. But last night I also ate cookies that my wife bought. I drink too much soda (soda has got to be my worst offence). I often eat frozen pizzas on weekends. Overall I eat well enough to maintain my weight but have a hard time cutting.	0
What's the most insidious way someone made your special thing all about them?	I'll offer up a light one: My partner and I went pretty non\-traditional with our wedding plans: low cost, informal ceremony, two parties a month apart, one on each coast. I made my dress, but splurged on a super cute pair of shoes I had been stalking for a year. ADORABLE Fluevog mary janes in my perfect color and style, and went so well with my dress you'd think I'd been orchestrating this for a decade. At our second party a friend of my mom's/mine sees my shoes and goes gaga over them and says "OMG I love those shoes, they would look so good on me. They are so ME!" B\*tch, you wish; you can tell me how much you envy and appreciate my style now though, thx.	I was sexually abused and scared to share it with anyone but police. I specifically told my mom not to share it because I was scared. My mother proceeded to call everyone she knew, even past neighbors we had, tell them all about it, and then talk about how hard and crippling it was *for her*.	0
What does depression feel like to you, personally?	Like all the colour has melted out of the world, and there is this glass wall around you that allows you to be in the world but not really engage with it. And everything is muted by the voices in your head telling you how worthless you are, how pointless everything is, how little anything matters. It also feels like being so tired your bones ache, all the time.	It feels like I'm struggling to stay afloat in choppy waters. No matter how hard I tread, I keep getting sucked down. ... this is why I take meds.	1
The US Treasury today announced that they are replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 with Harriet Tubman. What are your thoughts on this, if any?	Trade a NDN killer for WoC?? YES. YES. AND YES. I've lived so far to see a black president and now Harriet Tubman on a $20, you bet I'll be saving one of those for sure! Next up a NA persons or Brown person. WATTBA.	I'd like to see a Native American woman replace Andrew "Hmmm that Trail could use a lot more Tears on it" Jackson, but I'll take Harriet Tubman. It's good to have someone on our most common distributed denomination of currency that actually fought back against oppression instead of institutionalized it.	0
