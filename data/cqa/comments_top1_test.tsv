Women who‚Äôve dated a ‚Äúloser,‚Äù what made your ex a loser and what did you learn?	When I was 19 I was craving a major adventure (35f, now). I ended up on a remote island in northern Canada and lived in the woods off-grid. The guy I dated while there (2 years, ish) was such a loser. Like was 31 at the time I met him, so 12 years older than me. Had never finished high school. Did odd jobs for money. Was pretty bizarre looking, freakishly tall and skinny. He was a smart guy and incredible reader but really into conspiracy theories. Loved Coast to Coast AM and listened to it religiously. Was weirdly attached to his mother. Looking back, it‚Äôs just one huge cringe. I learned that I deserve better than that!	He would always say he wished he could afford to take me out on a nice date blah blah blah. He gets paid, we‚Äôre on our way to a sports bar (I‚Äôm buying) but he has to stop by his dealers house real quick to spend $100 on an ounce of weed. That was over ten years ago and I still have moments of ‚ÄúWTF was I thinking?‚Äù EDIT: We were on and off for a while - he broke up with me when I no longer had a car and he also cheated on me - this memory sums up the entire relationship.
Claiming Aspergers as a cop-out for being a jerk? Have any of you noticed this trend?	I've never had anyone actually claim they had aspergers, except as a joke. Maybe they were attempting a joke/acknowledgement of their assholeness?	I dated a guy who was actually diagnosed (well, after we dated) and he wasn't any more jerky than other dudes his age (and 20 year old college kids tend to be immature jerks). I'd say his demeanor was much more kind, like he actually gave a shit about what people thought of him.
So i asked a lesbian out on a date while her girlfriend was next to us. Men of Reddit, how have you messed up asking someone out?	Inside info. They weren't lesbians. It's just an easy way to get rid of you because they're not interested and to keep you from persisting.	When I was at my first middle school dance, there was a guy that I thought was a girl right? Super long blonde hair, skinny as a rail. I didn‚Äôt ask him out but I did ask him to dance üôè. I never really got to live that down, but he did cut his hair shortly after that so I‚Äôm guessing that wasn‚Äôt the first time that happened. Turned out to be a pretty cool dude and we became friends.
Men, what clothes do you find look attractive on women?	Idk why but business/business casual attire really does something for me. I'm also very much into punk/alt style clothing. But honestly, if I find someone attractive it doesn't really matter what they're wearing.	You won't get consistent answers here. Some men like keds and ripped jeans, some men like skirts and heels. Who were those people that told you that your style was slutty? Were any of them men you would actually want to date? How you *you* feel when wearing that style?
What is the most hurtful thing an SO has said to you?	"You're such an attention whore." After telling him repeatedly to please not do a certain thing around me because it triggered my PTSD. I heard this in the middle of a flashback I was having.	I've said this before in other threads: "I only married you because I wanted a baby." Said after we'd been together 10 years and our child was 6. That was meant to hurt me, and it did.
Shy guys, how do you feel when a girl suggest grabbing coffee with you?	¬øMinimal contact girl (Conversations and interactions limited to the work place)? I don't drink coffee, but would say the same if she suggest water (or something between the lines: "Im not thirsty, but thanks) xd. ¬øA friend or someone that i'm socially active with? Sure, why not. >has people asking her out every once a while ¬øWhy would that matter? xd	I tell them I don‚Äôt drink coffee. Then I spend the rest of the year calling myself an idiot cause what if the important part was spending time with me rather that the actual coffee??
What are little things men do that you can't stand?

What's your favorite romcom and what about it makes it your favorite?	The Proposal, Pretty in Pink, When Harry Met Sally, the Wedding Singer, 13 Going on 30. So many good ones	You've Got Mail. It's just such a great movie. I always feel hopeful about finding love after watching that movie.
Ladies who live alone! What advice would you give to a woman who is moving on her own?	Buy a gun, train regularly with the gun. Have an emergency plan. And always always be aware of your surroundings.	You need a plunger!! Maybe not immediately but there will be a day! Stock up on sick supplies because it sucks to live alone, be sick, and have to get off the couch to go buy soup and Advil. I have a separate checking account for bills/rent. Everything is set up on autopay and direct debits from that account. A portion of my paycheck direct deposits to that account so I never worry about having enough to cover bills. It's all automated and that takes sooo much stress out of life.
Have you ever been to a Planned Parenthood? If so, what do they do?	I went there to get a Plan B pill. They sold me one. The end. I can't tell you about everything else they do because I did not desire receiving every single service they provide.	In my case, they did a well-woman exam (breast exam and annual gynecological exam). They also renewed my birth control prescription at the time.
How long does it normally take you to orgasm from oral?	The reason so many guys can't orgasm from oral is that their circumcised and missing the majority of erogenous tissue. It's rarely a problem from uncircumcised guys. Circumcised men don't have have the stimulation in the frenulum and ridged band.	It depends entirely on how long my wife wants me to take. If she wants me off quickly, she knows what to do. If she wants to keep me twitching until she's ready, she'll do that too. Damn, she's good.
Guys of reddit that have had low self-esteem or seen someone with it, how has it been dealt with?	You could do what a lot of guys do in that situation. Replace your lack of self-appreciation with a massive ego and become a douchebag. Hope that helps	You just have to keep moving on and putting yourself out there. The biggest change in my attitude came when I accepted three basic truths: [1] You cannot make anyone like you or care about you, no matter what you do. [2] You cannot dictate what is attractive to other people. [3] Neither #1 nor #2 adjusts your worth as a person or as a man. Once I realized that all this is true, then my whole outlook on life changed.
How do you ladies overcome comparing yourselves to other girls when it comes to dating?	I just... don't? I guess because I like who I am idk It wasn't ever something I needed to overcome.	Basically the biggest thing for me was realizing that I shouldn't compare myself to other people in dating because we're all looking for different things. Back in high school I remember looking at other girls and going, "I'm pretty, I'm smart, why do they have boyfriends and I don't? I'm fat, but that girl's fatter. She has a boyfriend so why don't I?" And then eventually I just realized... I didn't want those girls' boyfriends, so why did I care if they had them? What I wanted was something different from them, and what those guys wanted was something different than me, so there was no point in comparing the rules because we weren't all actually playing the same game.
Men of Reddit, do you find that as you get older you become more conservative/traditional/failing to understand and approve of new trends? How do you guard against that?	The total intolerance of the ‚Äúliberal youth‚Äù is the trend I oppose. I don‚Äôt guard against it, I intentionally provoke it. It is delightful to see the small minded dullards defend their intolerance while spouting acceptance.	Honestly i was more conservative when i was younger. Now i just fucking hate both sides and their extreme ends.
What is your radical political idea?	I'm not American so I don't live with this problem but I think America needs gun control really fucking badly. I think most Americans are in denial about this problem. In Canada we have gun control and yes we still have shooting but look at the difference in rates. That can't just be because of population size. America also needs proper healthcare I don't know why conservatives are soooo against universal healthcare. These are probably the biggest reasons I would never move to America.	I don't think these are that radical but depending on company saying I am for legalizing weed and prostitution can get dicey. This from the united state perspective.
Do you like Dinosaurs and if so which are your favorite/s?	Dinosaurs! I love dinosaurs! In fact, a couple years ago I was on legal drugs recovering from surgery and did a bunch of dinosaur rhymes I remembered from childhood as answers to questions. Fun times. My favorite is probably the Carnotaurus. It was like a miniature T-Rex that was built to be a runner and chase down prey. And its name is MEAT BULL! Fuck yeah.	I love the big herbivores like Brachiosaurus cause I imagine they were like the cows of the dinosaur world, just big, sweet, and dopey.
Women who once had good prospects but then got hit hard by mental health issues, how do you deal with the feeling of not realising your potentials and being behind others?	You know, I did get hit hard by mental health, I think I‚Äôm not realizing my potential, but then when I sit back in my Audi and look at my six figure paycheque, I realize I‚Äôm doing just fine.	I read somewhere that people with trauma often feel behind in life (because of the mental health issues they have to work on) and that's made me feel a little better about not being in the confidence, mindful mental state others seem to be in.
How come I can't say "no fat chicks" on my online dating profile but it's okay for girls to say "no short dudes" on theirs?	IMO this is one of those things you really don't need to put out there. If they're fat just don't respond or say you're not interested and move on. Saying "no fat chicks" will just get you unnecessary shit from women.	You can say it if you want. [BOOM!](https://i.imgur.com/csTsDkQ.jpg) If you have that in your profile women that aren't fat will probably swipe left on you because of how crass it comes across.
What basic behavior/etiquette standard are you shocked that you had to teach a grown-ass adult?	I had to teach my 34 year old husband how to set a table. He had no idea that forks go on the left, and spoons, knives and water glasses on the right. We're not even talking a fancy dinner setting, just your standard sitting down to Wednesday night dinner.	I was a manager at a fast food restaurant. There were several employees who didn't understand basic customer relations, like that if a customer asked, "How's it going?" they don't actually want to hear the terrible details of your life. I'm talking, "Oh, I had miscarriage yesterday so I've been bleeding a lot" or "My boyfriend has had diarrhea for days so he's been grumpy." Just... shit you do not share with a stranger, much less someone who is coming in to order food.
What's your "screw it all I'm gonna treat myself" meal?	If it's just for me - a slab of sauteed calf's liver with calvados and beef jus, pommes fondant and grilled asparagus.	After a really tough/awesome day at work, maybe like once a summer, I'll call ahead to the crab shack. On my way home I'll swing by and pick up a dozen steamed blue crabs. On the commute home the smell is so amazing and the crabs are steaming up the windows. I'll dip my finger in the bag and eat a little of the spicy Old Bay seasoning to hold me over at red lights. Once I get home I put on a ratty t-shirt, line the coffee table with newspaper, and put two cold Natty Bohs within reach. Pop on a movie and start smacking dem babies. Crabs are an expensive treat and usually you eat them with a large group for special occasions. Getting a whole dozen to myself makes me feel like a decadent Roman emperor or something. I cackle like a mad man.
Guys who cut their arsehair, what's your technique?	I'm betting this is a very small percentage of the male population, most of whom are in the porn business. Still, I'll be checking back here just for the entertainment!	Hair clippers or beard trimmer. The real pro tip is to sit on the toilet facing the tank, all the hair falls into the bowl
Guys who have ever met a pornstar in real life, what was it like?	I went to college with a guy who went on to do porn. I asked him about it once. Said it was fun.	I met Stoya at one of her "movie" screenings (I believe she was the director or something, it was weird artistic type of stuff). She did a short Q&A afterwards then I sat with her for a bit at the afterparty to have a drink. I was actually quite surprised how well spoken she was and can say she definitely changed how I viewed pornstars for the most part. At the time, i dont believe her James Dean thing was public yet but I remember somebody asking how what it was like to date him and she said she didn't want to talk about it which seemed kinda odd. Overall it was an interesting experience. 9/10.
People from outside the United States, what is the most eye-rolling example of US cultural imperialism that you've experienced?	I grew up in Poland in 1960's, and when America "defeated" USSR we began to get many imperialist western ideas like freedom of speech, and greater number of political parties. Many old people see and say "are we America? why are we becoming America?" It is all very confusing.	I'm not from the US but I live there and ethnocentrism is the biggest problem I have with Americans. Just the expectation of other cultures to have the same morals and values as Americans and when they don't they're treated like devils.
How would you feel if your long term girlfriend has faked all of her orgasms with you?	I wouldn't care. If it was so unimportant to her she didn't bother telling me what she likes, that's hardly my problem. Keep moaning; I'm having a good time.	I would question why she wasn't upfront with me. Perhaps I could have changed that if she would've communicated her sexual needs. People that fake orgasms do more harm to themselves than to their partners.
Those of you who have had an affair with a university professor/lecturer- what‚Äôs your story? How did it happen and how did it end?	When I was a hot 20-year-old guy, circa '72 when the Second Wave of feminism was on, I took a women's studies class. The professor was about 30, attractive, single. I needed to speak with her about my paper. As a joke, I put on my sexy clothes, the sleeveless t-shirt and the short-shorts that were slit on the sides up to the waist. I entered her office, closed the door behind me, and said in a mock-coy voice "I'll do anything for an A." (pause) "Just kidding, I need some help with my term paper." She was slightly amused. Got a B+ on the paper, if memory serves.	Not quite the same but I once had a student ask me to get dinner at the college cafeteria with them. It was hella awkward, and I didn't know what to say, so I said "No thanks, I'm not on the meal plan."
Is it really that rare to meet women who can make you laugh?	To those of you who say women aren't funny... You just haven't met me. I'm fucking hilarious. *True.* Incidentally I find it amusing that we toss out Tina Fey as an example to 'women are funny'. Do you dickheads socialize at all? Sure funny is rare but we're not talking white-whale rare.	It's more rare to find women that make me genuinely laugh. I meet plenty of women that make me chuckle or smile with a little joke, but making me bust out in my hardy laugh... well that is a bit more difficult.
Will you ever ditch your girl friend for your gf? Why or why not?	I stopped going out with my girl friends who happened to be fwbs, alone. Only in groups with my gf there. Or a really large group. Out of respect. They still come over to chill though. My gf is completely aware of how our cohort works, doesn't have a problem. (I vet for that in an s.o.)	I don't disagree with the others but as soon as he said "I'm willing to hide it" I got a really bad vibe. Either he is aware that his relationship is bunk and he doesn't want to leave, or he knows being with you may cross some lines. I am ever the optimistic and well guess he is done with the relationship. But as soon as secret friends becomes a thing I get weirded out.

Men with small penises, how has it affected your self esteem and your sex life?	This is a little off topic, but I've been with men who are 7 inches and were still self conscious about their size. I felt bad that they felt that way.	In all honesty, the only thing you can do is to bang him so much that his dick gets sore. He's not going to get over it by you being empathetic because once you say "Oh it's fine," then he knows how bad the situation really is. Just keep demanding sex from him and get him to a point where he knows you're enjoying it because you keep wanting it.
What is the long term impact of having been in a sexual 'relationship' with an adult man as a teen?	I was 15, they were mid twenties/ early 30‚Äôs. Lovely men, I‚Äôm so glad my teenage sex drive was focussed on actual men not spotty oiks. Nothing negative at all. That came from the lad only a year or so older.	I was 17. He was 28. He was a family friend and he insisted we keep the "relationship" a secret. He was very controlling and abusive. He raped me multiple times. In the end I thought he would eventually kill me. My family eventually found out after I had tried to break up with him. He told me he wouldn't let me do that and just carried on with abusing me. The fallout was surreal. My family "forgave" me for "seducing" an older man. (Thank you evangelical Christian upbringing) I had developed a lot of shitty coping mechanisms to survive him that served my future abusive boyfriends very well. I lived with untreated anxiety and depression for 14 years. I nearly killed myself a couple of times. I finally got therapy in my 30s and started unravelling the whole situation. I'm better now, but still broken
Ladies who love ladies: Can you name a fictional female (book, TV or movie) who encapsulates as many of of the qualities you'd like to see in a woman?	Carol from The Walking Dead was my first thought when reading this. I don't really watch many movies or shows with women who are my type I guess. She's super strong and seeing her change throughout the show has been amazing. I love her adaptability and how she doesn't let her emotions take over her actions. Of course, they accompany her decisions, but she uses logic first. She also knows how to laugh and joke to lighten the mood.	C.J Cregg from the West Wing - smart, witty, strong, caring I have a crush on Kaylee from Firefly. And Zoe from Firefly. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore).
My girlfriend and I go to work, eat dinner, watch TV then go to bed. How can we break this routine?	Watch TV before you go to work, go to bed as soon as you get home. Adopt a homeless man. Rename him "the" for maximum cmmunications confusion. Take down all your curtains/blinds and nonce around your house wearing only silken robes. Learn Esperanto. Join a local militia. Take up flint knapping. And if none of that works, try doing it in one or both of your butts. The final answer is always in one of your butts.	I always wonder what other people do in their daily lives. Glad to hear it's about the same as what I do.
What makes a woman trashy?	* Spreading rumors to give people bad rep. * Cursing * Piercings * Tatoos of any sort It's all about respect	A woman being "trashy" is much the same thing as a guy being a typical "douchebag" or "tool". Shitty clothes in the wrong situations. Obnoxious tattoos Over use of profanity Resorting to violence or the threat of it Just being a generally shitty person quite honestly.
What's the best compliment you've ever gotten? What compliment would you most like to get?	I've gotten comments from girls about my pupils always being huge. Not really a compliment per se, but I liked the fact that they actually took their time to look at some of my body parts a little closer. So I am going to take that as compliments either way! It feels good now when I think about it too. They actually checked out a part of my body! Not every day that happends! I like to hear compliments that actually are about me personality or my body. All that "you're funny" and "you're strange" is just annyoing as fuck. I really want to hear that someone likes my ways or the way I think about something, how someone feels around me and that I perhaps have some good aspects to my quite fit body! The hunt continues!	I recently got back in touch with my best friend from highschool. Turns out she had, at times, been asked why she hung out with me and why we were - and still are friends. What she replied was "because he is the only one that has been true to himself." With me often having issues with anxiety and self doubt that has been the most reassuring and empowering thing I have heard in quite a while.
Is 30 too old to sow your wild oats?	Probably, you'll just be that 'weird creepy old guy' at the club that we're all familiar with. I suggest not going activities meant for 20yr olds	30 is not too old by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I'd say 30 is the best age to do it. 1. I'm assuming you have a higher paying job than a good chunk of your 20-something counterparts 2. I'm assuming you're better put together than your 20-something counterparts. Meaning you dress better and have the money to put into dressing better. 3. Being a little older plays to your advantage. You're not young and dumb and you have the appeal of being older to the opposite sex. 30 isn't 35 or 40. Don't try and kick it with 18 year olds, though, because that's just weird. 21 is still too young. You'll have more than enough tail to chase that's your own age.
What's something that you think is blatantly sexist but men disregard you when you tell them about it?	Waiting for a bus. Two guys come and also wait for bus. Bus comes, they offer me to get on first. Well Yeah, I was here first, but thank you for not letting your testosterone overcome you and fling my feeble form out of the way.	Taking something I say, disagreeing with me (!), rewording it, and presenting it as their own statement. It goes something like this: Me: The sky is blue. Dude: No, actually the sky is the color on the rainbow between green and purple. A blue tone. I work in STEM and it's so common. One of my coworkers got so frustrated one day she announced she needed a microphone called A Man Repeating Our Ideas As His Own. Thank god I have moved to a different lab with a woman Pi who is a badass in her own right and has never made me feel like this once.
Is it appropriate for a girl to get upset or angry when a guy cancels a date the day of, via text, only after a girl asks if their plans are still on?	Shit comes up. In addition, girls do this all the time. It's some stupid cosmo like shit test. They blow you off and see how you react. The blow-off is like a mini-date.	Unfortunately 'flaking' is very common in this dating climate. Being upset/angry is an understandable response, but ultimately it doesn't make sense to dwell on things that are out of your control.
What tips do you have for making international travel and flights go as smooth as possible?	If you're flying eastward, sleep on the plane. The jet lag is much worse going west to east than east to west.	Wear slip on shoes. Dress for comfort, and in layers. Planes alternate between too hot, and too cold. Bring your charging cords, and a backup portable charger. Bring a couple things to do, I like to have my journal, a book, my Switch, and my podcasts handy. Not to mention movies downloaded to my phone if I don't care for the planes selections. Make a play list ahead of time. I do one misc and one for easy listening to help me sleep. I also use noise cancelling headphones, bc babies. Bring a water bottle, you can fill it after you get through TSA. It needs to be empty prior. Have your ticket and IDs handy. I also recommend those neck pillows.
Doctors of r/AskWomen, have you ever suspected a patient of yours was lying to you for any reason and, if so, why?	Not a doctor, but doctors ALWAYS seem to think I'm lying about my issues and I just have anxiety. Unable to breath? Anxiety (I had scaring on lungs) Fainting? Anxiety (I was deficient in key nutrients) Extreme Fatigue? Anxiety (CFS)	Patients lie literally all the time for many different reasons. A lot of times they lie because they are embarrassed about something. Other patients lie to try to get something they want (this could be something like ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm feeling much better‚Äù when it doesn‚Äôt really seem like they feel better because the patient wants to go home from the hospital or to get paperwork signed for work or many other things). Some patients are such sweethearts that they lie to make you feel better. For example some patients will lie and tell you that whatever you prescribed or recommended helped even though they didn‚Äôt do you don‚Äôt feel like you failed or something (please don‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôs really sweet but we can‚Äôt help you if we don‚Äôt know something is wrong!).
In your opinion , do you wish you postponed having children to a later age , or would of you started having children at a younger age ..and why ?	The world is overpopulated as it is. You should adopt. Your age is more or less irrelevant. If you are financially stable and ready for adoption your application process will reflect that.	Father at nineteen. I love my son to death, but I should have waited. Wrong woman to have a kid with. Couldn't really be the dad I wanted because I couldn't really provide for him without the education I couldn't get at the time.
What's something that made you stop pursuing that dream girl of yours?	When she turned me down when I asked her to prom, I didn't stop. When I went off to college and she moved away, I didn't stop. When we were living 150 miles apart after college, I didn't stop. When she had a baby, I didn't stop. When I got the invitation to her wedding, I didn't stop. When I went to her wedding and watched her get married, I didn't stop. But I did move away - 1,800 miles away. And then, gradually, I stopped. And then a decade later, Facebook.....	When I found pictures of her cousin's dick in her cellphone and she sent him videos of herself masturbating.... Wtf.
Married men, if you suddenly ended up on the dating market again, what weirdly specific deal breakers would you have?	Not married anymore, but... Borderline Personality Disorder. If you have that I don't want to be anywhere near you, and if you have a shred if decency you won't try to subject people to dating you	Maybe this isn't "weirdly specific" but someone who is late all the time. I love my wife but she is so insanely disorganized and has absolutely no sense of urgency. I had a vacation coming up a few weeks, ago and a big part of looking forward to it was not having to wait for her in order to do stuff.
Men would my situation be a turn-off for you?	If she's attractive and has a personality I find charming, sure, I'd probably be interested. I'm ok with a lack of experience, so that's not really an issue, but I don't find painfully shy people particularly charming. And having dated someone with depression, I'm not sure if I'd be very eager to get back into that situation.	You're gonna want to find a super sensitive, somewhat inexperienced guy who is willing to work with you. Put up a dating site profile, be somewhat upfront by saying something like, "I don't have much experience dating, but I want a relationship if you're willing to work with me." Everyone comes with baggage. It's not like you're ForeverAlone.
Vegan women, what finally made you cross the fence and become vegan?	I guess I just realised I was a hypocrite - I said I loved animals, yet I ate them. It had actually been eating at me at the back of my mind for a few years but the thought of changing my lifestyle was overwhelming. I would tell myself 'well the animal is already dead so I might as well eat it' to make myself feel better. I started working with a vegan guy and saw that it really wasn't hard to be vegan. I watched a few documentaries and read stuff online to kind of answer questions I was too self conscious to ask my friend and I guess a switch just flicked and I realised how messed up it was to eat other living beings and treat them as commodities, like milk producing and egg laying machines. It's like seeing the world through different eyes. *cue downvotes*	I worked on one of those "organic local humane" dairy farms, the kind that sell their goods at farmer's markets. I was horrified and disgusted after only a few days. That was 12 years ago and I've been totally vegan ever since.
Men who are infertile, when did you find out, and how has it affected your life?	I am by choice. It's affected me mentally I suppose. Just knowing that it would never be OK with about 80% of women (my own estimate). I care more about passing on a legacy instead of DNA & making sure that if I decide to parent, it's 100% by choice because I know what it takes to raise a decent human being. There are more than enough unwanted kids out there in foster homes or single moms who probably don't want any more children for awhile.	I got tested when I was ~32. Both Mrs and I got tested after several years of unprotected sex failed to result in 'accidentally' producing a pregnancy. No idea what caused sterility, but it's there. I was a little upset for a while, but never having to worry about pregnancy was a good alternative. Since Mrs died a couple years ago, I'm sort of glad that I'm not raising any kids by myself. There are some mixed feelings, but I'm okay with who I am.
Is anyone else baffled when they see people on reddit talking about how a lot of women don't realize how much men need to feel desired by their SO?	that's completely foreign to me. when i have a boyfriend my life pretty much becomes "Destiny's Child - Cater 2 U"	I was just thinking about this the other day when someone told me that I like people too much! When I like/love someone, I show it. I show it like crazy. I express my adoration openly and I will very happily move mountains for them. But then I'm told that guys like the chase and by showing all of this affection I'm not letting them "win". That guys need to feel like they're winning and that they've earned something in order to value it. Therefor, if they don't feel like they've earned you, they will not value you. We've all been getting mixed messages here! I imagine there are plenty of women who think they'll scare a man away by showing "too much" love and affection. Just show the people you love that you love them and if they don't like it they can fuck off. Edit: missed a word!
Women who met their SO after years of being single and almost giving up, what's your story?	Why would I ever try to find someone? Seems awful. We can find each other, but until then, I'd rather be alone. I also go years and years without a relationship, so take that as you will. I'm in a relationship now after about seven years of being single. Had a quasi relationship in that time, but it was only because I got knocked up, I only wanted a few dates with the dude to relieve some boredom.	Suffered considerable trauma from an ex and was unsuccessful in finding a new relationship for ten years. Then I decided to give Tinder one more try and met my wonderful SO. It's almost like I needed to endure and experience life on my own to become the person I am now. Like they say you can't love another until you love yourself.
Anyone get married for reasons other than love? How did it turn out?	My ex is getting married to the girl he started dating a week after me and has only been with for 10 months. I think he just really wants to be married- and anyone who fits the basic qualifications will do.	I got married because I wanted to run away from my family and my home country. He was older and knew why I was doing it and he was fine with it. I liked him a lot, but love didn't have much to do with our marriage.
Men of Reddit, I am a lady about to confess romantic feelings to one of my best male friends. I am 50/50 on if they are reciprocated. Any advice on how to make this as easy on him/least awkward for him as possible - no matter what his response may be?	This is going to sound unorthodox, but trust me... get a couple of your best girlfriends, get all dolled up, your prettiest dress, go to a nice wine bar, drink till last call, take an Uber to his house, drunken love confession, sleep with him. I give it more like 90/10 odds.	"I'd like to take you on a date" is pretty good. It's an open offer, it's easy to refuse not-to-awkwardly, and doesn't scream "I want your cock" from the get go.
What is the most fucked up secret you share with your SO?	Female here. I don't think there's anything he doesn't know. And if there does happen to be something, I have no problem telling him. I'm fairly certain he feels the same. If you can't trust your SO with all your deep dark secrets, you're probably with the wrong one.	Well there was the one time I was really drunk and thought I was in the bathroom but I was actually waking my wife up with a golden shower. She doesn't tell anyone about that night.
Women of Reddit, how has the stereotype of women being more ‚Äúemotional‚Äù affected your life?	Slightly, but not to the point that I completely hide it. I have more control on showing my emotions but I definitely am open if I feel a certain way and let the other person know they're affecting me. If I get a response of being called too sensitive, or some other bs, I'll just tell the person to keep their distance from me. There's just certain things I'll shrug my shoulders at and other times I'll call something out. Also people usually tell me my face is very expressive, so that alone made me just say oh well whatever my face shows is what it is.	I am emotional. And I see nothing wrong with that. When I was a kid I was always told that I was too ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù. But I think the message should change. Why is it wrong to feel and love deeply? To be moved to tears because of another person‚Äôs plight? To feel anger at injustice instead of turning a blind eye? By telling kids that they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù, we‚Äôre raising adults who don‚Äôt care about each other. Sensitivity and compassion are beautiful. I‚Äôve also noticed that people don‚Äôt take my emotions very seriously. Me being angry is just me ‚Äúbeing emotional‚Äù. It belittles my problems.
What is the nicest thing someone's ever done or said to you?	Nicely put, we were on spring break and playing truth or dare. This girl wanted truth and someone asked ‚Äúout of this whole room (about 6 guys and 6 girls) who would you want to fuck the most?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh definitely skullyD, 100%.‚Äù Was nice to hear.	My mother was ailing and it was the day before she passed away. I had lost my sister a few months before, and was caregiver to both through their illnesses without any close family for thousands of miles. One of my cousins sent me a huge delivery of frozen gourmet foods. This thing was amazing. I felt so loved and cared for. In the days and weeks that followed, I was able to defrost and cook as much as I needed. It brought a new meaning to the phrase ‚Äúcomfort food.‚Äù Also, that particular cousin and her sister really stepped up for me and are now two of the closest people in my life, even though they live far away. We were never super close before, and now we talk a few times a week.
What's the most "unmanly" thing you do?	I'm really surprised no one has said "Your Mom" since technically, she isn't manly... unless she's a butch dike or a post op...	I'm a man. If I do it, it's by definition "manly." And that includes having tea parties with a toddler and helping her put a bonnet on her beloved Pooh Bear.
How do you make a date not feel or sound like a job interview?	I really don't understand how this is an issue to some people. You just chat to the person, if there is chemistry, the conversation flows and won't feel like an interview	Take her to a monster truck rally or something fun and exciting. That's what Aziz says. People too often pick the most boring shit to do on dates and you should really try to do something fun rather than sit there and eat dinner or sit there and drink coffee. That's why it feels like an interview because you're doing some boring stuff.
What was your worst "nice guy" experience like?	Was a nice guy, got her out of credit card debt, saved her from an abusive relationship from her family, helped her finance her last year of school fees, all the while she was telling me that when she loved me and was ready to commit to a relationship when she got out of this bullcrap mess. At the end of it, she ghosted me, i sent her 4 angry msgs scolding her for using me and to go fuck herself. 2 months later found myself on a collegehumor post on being ‚Äúthat edgy nice guy‚Äù. Thanks life i seen it all now	I had a guy who tried to follow me to Europe and told all our friends we were in a relationship when we weren't. I told him repeatedly that we were never going to be in such a relationship, but it took him almost three years for it to finally sink in. I knew he finally heard what I was saying when I got a nearly incoherent stream of drunken texts from him saying that he's a great guy because he never raped me while I was drunk but also threatening to come over right then to rape me to show me that he's a "real man."
Ladies, does your butt hole get itchy?	Yes. I take toilet paper from work and it's pretty rough, plus i often poop more than once in a morning, depending on if coffee was had or if I'm eating tons more veggies than usual. If i don't cleanse my cornhole with some kind of moistened towelette before going out it will almost undoubtedly get real itchy. I should probably just buy toilet paper, it's not worth it anymore, having to put up with all this cornhole business.	All the time!!!! Edit: I decided to google it and apparently it's because I use wet wipes every time I go #2 to try and prevent the frequent UTIs I used to have. The chemicals in the wipes can dry you out and cause itching. The more you know... Edit 2: My first top comment on a thread is about my butt hole. Would you look at that.
Inspired by AM, what's the worst injury you've had happen to your vagina?	I fell off a platform at a club and landed spread eagle on the corner. My labia were lopsided for two weeks. Pants were hard.	When I was a young teenager and fairly foolish, I got the great idea once to put hand sanitizer on my vagina. Don't put hand sanitizer on your vagina.
Women who have has sex with women and men, were there any constant differences you noticed? What were they?	For me personally being with a woman is like never ending foreplay and it doesn‚Äôt satisfy me like a man does. I still like playing with women though it‚Äôs like cute and sexy little appetizer. But with a man it‚Äôs like the entree and dessert I can‚Äôt believe I just made that analogy but that‚Äôs just how I can best describe it from my pov	I have never had a woman be interested in anything like spitting on me or choking me, or penetrating me so hard it hurts*. As a matter of fact, with women partners I felt comfortable saying that I didn‚Äôt want to be penetrated but I was interested in X and Y, and maybe we could try Z? There was a lot of communication like ‚Äúfaster or slower‚Äù or ‚Äúis that okay?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know, I just felt like my women partners cared about me orgasming. With men, first of all, pussy eating is only given as the beginning of a sexual encounter or as a quid pro quo for a blow job. There was no orgasm just for the sake of giving me pleasure. Sex wasn‚Äôt over until he ejaculated. I have had two good male partners and what made them good was that they really, really loved women.
When was a time when you embarrassed yourself so badly that you just wanted to crawl in a hole and die?	Back in 11th grade, a classmate (let's call him P) used to sit next to me. P was a nerdy and quiet kid who looks like any other weirdo but he was savage with his words. I had a runny nose that day. So i sneeze really hard and a huge watery drop comes out of my nose. I wipe it with my hankey in a microsecond but then i see P looking at me with a poker face. I tell myself he didn't notice anything but whenever i we used to cross paths, he always pretended to ask his friends in front of me if they have cold or cough. This went on for a few days... And all that while, my newly formed boyfriend used to share a dorm with P.	Over 10 years ago, I went over to my friend‚Äôs house for her high school graduation bbq. Let myself in the back gate, mingled a bit, and was so starving after working 12 hours that grabbed a plate before I found my her. Continue the hunt for my friend, still can‚Äôt find her, so finally just call and she says she‚Äôs in the kitchen. I‚Äôm in the kitchen. She‚Äôs not there. It clicks that I‚Äôm at the wrong damn house. I have never bolted so fast in my life!
How do you spoil yourself?	I sit in a gorgeous local hipster cafe (there are a few to choose from) and slowly drink an iced black coffee while making lists on my phone or otherwise musing/planning about my future. The one nearest my house serves me the iced black coffee in a tall milkshake glass with a straw. I can close my eyes and pretend it's a milkshake :-/ (I decided to not drink coffee or other non-alcoholic drinks with any calories in them any more over the last month, to help me ease into a lower-sugar lifestyle. Alcoholic drinks are still fine though - wine, beer, alcoholic milkshakes even. I make the rules!) (It's a damn shame, because the aforesaid cafe makes an excellent donut-&-espresso milkshake with extra donut on top. I had it once before I made the Rule, it was so good.)	For my last few birthdays I've taken the day off of work, stayed in bed reading until about noon, ordered tons of sashimi (take out, so I don't have to change out of pajamas and I barely have to talk to anyone), and played video games/watched Netflix until my husband came home to take me out to dinner.
Have you had a friend/family member/partner who was a narcissist? How have you handled those relationships?	Brother, ex-husband, and one of my sons all narcs. You can never win with them. It is best to limit contact or eliminate it all together if you can. Very toxic energy. They will pull you down with them by intentionally starting fights, gas-lighting situations, and making you feel worthless. No one can help them, not even themselves because they don't believe they are ever wrong.	Nobody in my inner circle, thankfully, but broadly? Of course. Who hasn't? I've just learned to stay far away. The thing narcissists hate most is someone who won't buy into their bullshit. When dealing with narcissists, I usually just say things like, "Oh, how great for you!" or "Well, isn't that a nice bit of news?" in a way that makes it clear I'm being polite rather than truly impressed. I swear, *nothing* drives narcissists away more effectively than not giving them an audience to primp and preen before.
What's your go to 'getting over a break up' starter pack?	Going on lots of dates. Not to look for a new partner right away but the ego boost is always nice. Learning a new skill makes you feel like you're new life is better and more accomplished. Going on a road trip with your bff and taking a million photos to replace all the ones with your ex on social media.	* Get a massage * eat some tasty food * hit the gym * drink * flirt with other people * coma out, enjoying my whole goddamn bed to myself * wake up, be stoked I don't have to be hungover and dealing with the person's shit * do whatever I feel like (likely binge watch tv because hangover) * wake up the next day, get back to work, feel good, smash life Do not break up during the week unless maybe it's a Thursday. Ideally do it Friday or Saturday. Ideally also do it before bed so when you wake up you feel better; you don't want to be crying all through a day if avoidable!
So I was invited to a party by this girl I‚Äôm involved with, but she also invited another man I know she‚Äôs talking to. Anyone ever been in a situation like this and if so, what did you guys do?	Didn't even read past the title. How cucked do you have to be to even consider attending as 1/2 of a dual male attachment to a female's attention prosthesis. But, you will go, because you like it, and you are a cuck. Enjoy	She's basically keeping you on the back burner in case things don't work out for her with someone else, in this particular case the other guy. She probably does value your friendship, but I'd drop any expectation that y'all will ever be a thing. Start getting out there and seeing other women. When she tries to get possessive tell her that you're single and she needs to back off, or cut her out. If the "party" would just be the four of you I wouldn't bother, unless her friend is cute and single.
Girl said she wishes I was gay so we could be best friends, called me "adorable" and "cute". How do I make sure women don't see me as that guy?	Are you sexually assertive? Are you confident? Are you masculine? Don't be friends with girls just for the sake of being friends. Do you fuck them? Do they help you fuck other girls? Most of my female-relationships is based around helping each other out.	I don't have any pithy advice about your situation OP, but speaking as a gay guy, I and a fair amount of my brethren hate it when people pull that shit... that whole, weird, borderline fetishized 'Gay BFF' stereotype where some girl or group of them thinks that being gay means we're automatically down for going shopping with them, cruising guys at the mall, getting pedicures, going out clubbing every weekend and shit like that. FFS, I'm a dude who lives out in the country, works the land, has a small chainsaw collection, lives a fairly earthy lifestyle and dislikes patronizing behavior from people who think I'm automatically going to be their smarmy, catty, entertaining BFF just because I romantically prefer the gender group they aren't in. I daresay there's a fair amount of us who wouldn't even find them interesting. /rant
What is your parents biggest flaw?	So as a kid I struggled quite a bit with my anger management. Thankfully that's gone now with their help(besides maybe when I'm playing a video game and I'm alone anyway). Sadly this now means that I'm not the angriest but my partens, espacially my father, are. Nothing can be said "normally". Unless I want them screaming at me I'll have to acknowlegde they're right and I'm wrong within the first sentence or they start getting pissed off that "im not answering the question". I'm an incredibly laid back person now and I don't get angry or stressed quickly anymore, which really sucks since my parents do and half the argumants go from the actual issue to me asking them to please calm down this is not an issue can you speak like I didn't just murder our cat.	They don't know how to be emotionally available to me as an adult man. They were great when I was a kid, and they are great to my sister, but as soon as I hit my growth spurt I kind of felt like I was a stranger living in their house. To be fair to them, it's fairly common. [Research reveals that we generally stop touching boys when they reach the age of 8, and we teach them to reject access to feelings, emotions and emotional vocabulary because these are deemed ‚Äútoo feminine.‚Äù ](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understanding-the-erotic-code/201609/the-top-ten-myths-about-men-s-sexuality) One of my parenting goals is to teach my son it's okay to have feelings and it's okay to need a hug.
Parents, what's the worst you've ever punished your children, and what did they do to prompt it? Do you regret it?	My dad threatened to put me in time out for three hours when I was little. He also put me in time out....when I was eleven. He was frustrated because he was trying to build something and I guess I was in the way. I was mortified because I thought (and still think) that eleven year olds are way too old for time outs	My son was about 4 and would not stop slamming his bedroom door. After various talkings-to, timeouts, and such didn‚Äôt convince him to stop slamming the door, he lost door privileges. I calmly told him exactly that... having a door is a privilege and he didn‚Äôt deserve one. Then I pulled the hinge pins and removed the door. He was without a door for at least 3 weeks. Honestly, it was really annoying for me and Husband during that time, as we had to be a lot quieter after his bedtime. Also, the cats would pester him during the night because he couldn‚Äôt shut them out. He‚Äôs 9 now and almost never slams doors.
Men of reddit, how many friends do you communicate with on a daily basis using chat or text mesages?	Girl here. Question for you guys. It seems like you guys don‚Äôt really text daily that often whereas I text my female friends daily. I‚Äôve tried texting a guy I‚Äôm friends with daily but he doesn‚Äôt ever seem to initiate. We (very briefly) dated before and broke it off and are now friends. Should I just lay off and let him do his thing or keep reaching out? I know friendships between two girls and between two guys can be different and I want to be more understanding and conscious of that without being the ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù	None that are daily. There are about 3 separate people that I try to chat with once every few weeks or so. None of them ever message me first so I don't want to be bothering them too often. I am very lonely.
Do you cuddle when you sleep? Or are you are non cuddler?	I'm a cuddler, my boyfriend is a non-cuddler. Also, he's a SUPER light sleeper, and I snore. So this is how we fall asleep pretty much every night: 1. Him on the outside of the bed, me on the inside. 2. Fan directly by his face, blowing at top speed to help drown out my snoring. 3. Earplugs in his ears to further drown out my snoring and any other noise. 4. Me sleeping with my back to him so my face doesn't dry out from the fan *and* to redirect my snoring away from him. 5. Butts touching to accommodate my need for physical touch. Also, though, we spend 20-30 minutes cuddling and kissing and talking before we get in our sleep positions mentioned above, and that helps me get my cuddles in too. He loves snuggling, just not when he's trying to sleep.	On the one hand, I like it as it helps to settle me and stop me from tossing and turning so I can get to sleep faster. On the other, it can get too hot and there's times where I just have to be in a different position. My SO is a total sleep cuddler though. He'll be sound asleep and I'll make a tiny movement and suddenly he's cuddling me so hard that I can't move an inch. He's totally unaware of it as well which makes it cuter.
Guys, when did you realise that the time has come to propose?	Beware. You say she says one thing then proceeds to do the opposite. Example, doesn't want to move fast... bang, your living together... say she doesn't want to move fast... when are you going to make one of the most important decisions of your life, quick, quick propose. Have you met the parents? What's the hurry? If you continue to see divergence between spoken and action it may be the character of the individual. Things have a tendency to magnify and be more evident over time. Worst case scenario: promises to love and honor then... 7 years in you are replaced but still paying the mortgage... no longer loving and no honor. Been there, done that. Best wishes.	My SO was moving into my place and having a hard time with her flat mate. She finally snapped at her ‚ÄúSara, it‚Äôs been great living with you for three years, but I want to spend my *whole life* with X, so this *is* happening‚Äù When I heard that later I was hit in the feels massively and I realised I felt the same. Proposed the next day.
What are super introverted people supposed to do if they actually go to a bar/out alone?	I'd suggest not trying to meet people like that if it makes you uncomfortable. There are plenty of other ways to meet people.	Watch the TV that's on. Chat with the bartender and anyone else that's watching what you're watching. Play music on the box and see if anyone else is into it. Play a game of darts or pool and if anyone asks to join you, let them. Just enjoy yourself and be willing to allow others to join in if they're wlling
Guys, what have you noticed that girls do on first dates that bothers you?	I've been off the dating market since before Tinder was ever a thing. I had to meet my dating prospects in the real world. Do y'all fuckers really deal with such horseshit as what you've listed here, nowadays? Because, fuck all that with a spiky dildo. Back in my day (2012), any girl I went on a date with was equally excited to go on a date with me. That meant they'd show enough respect to be on time, be present, etc. It wasn't until after the first date that they'd decide to treat me like shit because of reasons or vice versa. Maybe my preconceptions are out of date, but I think maybe the reason your dates treat you like shit is partially because you let them. The other part is because no one ever taught them better.	Being quiet forcing all the conversation onto the man, and then not being particularly responsive if they are guiding the conversation in the right direction. It's like a job interview sometimes and totally one sided.
Ladies of Reddit: is Reddit misogynistic?	Oh quick reminder to everyone that if you're posting links to threads in other subs, they need to be archived (ie older than 6months) or else your comment will be removed :)	Oh quick reminder to everyone that if you're posting links to threads in other subs, they need to be archived (ie older than 6months) or else your comment will be removed :)
What is your funny or strange Pavlovian response?	I grew up going to a Mexican restaurant every Sunday. Now every time I pass a Spanish music channel on the radio, I crave chips and salsa.	If I see a mouse on the ground, I jump down to try to catch it. Years of working in a research lab, if someone dropped a mouse, you quickly try to pick it up. I was parking my bike downtown and saw a little field mouse slowly walking by. I was halfway down to it when I realized I shouldn't try to pick up wild mice.
What would people be surprised to know you‚Äôre NOT into?	Talking about babies. As a woman, in a very male-orientated industry I find it annoying when I meet a guy for ~~a~~ the first time at work and their words 90% of the time are 'Do you have children'. No I don't, and I find discussing my fertility really personal	Travelling. I find it more stressful than my job and less fun than a quiet weekend at home, so I just don't do it any more.
Ladies, what life lesson did you learn recently that you wish you had learned sooner?	That some ladies are too pretty to be friends with. They only befriended you to make them look cool and everything. Some guy friends only used you to get to the pretty friends. So yah i learnt my lesson that pretty face doesnt mean a pretty heart.	To pick my battles. I used to be the kind of person who got worked up about every little thing and really went hard on discussions and arguments. I've always been really stubborn, so I guess it stemmed from that. Anyway, I've since realized that not everything is a hill I want to die on and sometimes you just need to step down and not lose your mind over every little thing, specially when dealing with certain people or certain topics.
How old are you and what is the most important thing that you've learned so far about life?	Won't give out my exact age, but I'm older than the average redditor. The most important thing I've learned is how to manage finances. I come from lower middle class, so I suppose I started out a little better than most, but everything I've made I've made on my own. I've never been in more debt than I had the means to pay off (even if I lost my job). The couple jobs I've had paid only a little more than average, yet I was able to essentially retire before I was 30. I gave up most of my 20s to make a large enough nest egg to invest it and live off of it. For those interested I highly, highly recommend the book "The Millionaire Next Door".	19 The most important thing I've learned is that you shouldn't underestimate what you can get if you ask nicely.
Women who like to bake/cook: what is NOT worth making from scratch?	Pie dough! So much easier to buy it premade, as long as you buy a good brand. Most things are better scratch-made if you are willing to spend the time, but convenience wins out for me.	Puff pastry. That shit is $2 at the grocery store and will easily consume a few hours if you try to make it from scratch
My GF is aborting our baby and it‚Äôs mentally destroying me. What do I do?	I get the "her body, her choice" stuff. I do. The way I see it, though, there are two bodies, there, and one is 50% the dad's, and it's clear the Dad loves it. I'm sorry, man. I have no idea what to do in this situation. All I can offer is that I think it's natural to feel that way about this; I don't think what you're feeling is wrong, and I am genuinely sorry. It's almost as if having your choice taken away sucks for *all* parties involved.	Get someone to talk to. A professional is probably better. Talking it out with friends and family will probably poison their relationship to her or you since this will be something you feel strongly about and abortion is a topic that kills from miles away. Keep that in mind. I'd think long and hard about if you want to continue a relationship with someone that has different goals as far as children are concerned.
[Update - I had the interview] A potential employer made a sexual joke during our e-mailing back and forth. Bad sign?	That's not a sexual joke. A sexual joke would be: "Well, I hope you won't take up Football Fridays with HR" That guy is a straight up misogynist. And possibly a creep.	Gross. You are doing the right thing by bringing this all up to the women counter-part. Good luck, I'd like to hear what she says.
Men with stressful jobs, what does your SO do (or what do you wish your SO would do) to help make it better?	Take care of the home life. Keep the house clean, have a good meal ready for him when he gets home, make household decisions yourself when possible.	From my experience, the most important part of anything you decide to do is this: Remember that you volunteered to do it out of love, and never use it as leverage against him. Nothing ruins a favor like secretly keeping count.
Do unattractive women really feel completely ignored/invisible?	No, they lie to you about that. It's all lies, because women are lying liars who lie. Seriously, when someone says that that's their experience, you might want to believe that that's their experience...	Yeah, that's pretty classic. I get that this is new to you, but this is not a new thing. ________________________________________________ Edit: Dustin Hoffman has some neat commentary from when he made Tootsie (if you don't know the movie, he's playing an out of work actor who dresses as a woman to dodge he reputation of being difficult). I recommend watching the [whole clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPAat-T1uhE), but the relevant part starts around 1:30. ___________________________________________ Edit2: Oh hey! I've been gilded, thank you kind stranger!
What "superstition" do you believe in?	Me and my sister are synced with the moon so we do which craft under the full moon. We know it won‚Äôt work but it‚Äôs still fun.	Celebrating something before it‚Äôs a done deal. It came from my younger days when I would do online dating. I‚Äôd talk to people through the websites and text with them but as soon as I saved their number under their name or even a description in my phone, they would ghost me. My fianc√© and I are currently under contract to purchase a house and everyone keeps congratulating us. But until I‚Äôve got the keys in my hand and my stuff in the new house, I am not celebrating shit.
What‚Äôs the dumbest thing your boss or coworker has ever said to you?	5 yrs ago Co-worker(37), what is this ‚Äúwow‚Äù? And you can only play it online? Hahahha that‚Äôs the most stupid thing I ever heard, that‚Äôs never gonna hold.	A coworker - "Why do you feel the need to leave at 5? I put in MY time and stay till 9 or 10 every day" She hangs out with coworkers (saying horrendous things about other coworkers) on another floor for hours at a time, shops and/or watches soccer for about 4 hours a day. Putting dual monitors to good use i guess! Me - "my contract says 9-5, my work is done in a timely fashion, and I am exempt from over time." She later reported me for the one time i left 3 minutes early to catch an earlier train because my dog was sick. I already cleared it with my boss..
Fellow unattractive/average looking women, how do you prevent becoming bitter due to the treatment you get (or don't get) because of your physical appearance?	Remember how uncomfortable it was to be hit on at my last job. I'm not attractive, but I'm in a male dominated field.	Find great, quality people who love me and don't judge on appearance. Find ways to raise my own self-esteem that aren't based on appearance, or are external, but are not based on the opinions of others. Be okay with having only so many people in my life (but that's just because I'm bad at putting myself out there, probably...)
What is something you always wanted to try and thought you would love, but then wound up hating once you tried it?	Houmous. I thought I'd love it, but that stuff is not fit for human consumption. The same goes for avocados. Wouldn't even feed it to the pigs.	When I was a kid I used to be obsessed with little house on the prairie and there was a time when Laura ate maple syrup covered snow and it sounded like the best thing ever. I tried it, of course with crappy fake syrup and it was so disgusting. I was so upset that my beloved Laura ingalls wilder betrayed me
Your date doesn't leave a tip, what do you do?	Tipping is not required. Idk, I'm from California and the servers here make minimum wage. I find it ridiculous that people get butthurt if you don't tip. As mentioned below tipping began to help supplement those UNDER the minimum wage line. It was also done to build rapport if you wanted to become a "regular". I know plenty of other people who have shitty minimum wage jobs that DO NOT get tipped. Nobody bats an eyelash. Waiters are not special. Their job is not insanely difficult. A tip is awesome but Dont look down on others just because they didn't feel the need to hand out extra money to people with normal minimum wage jobs.	I'd probably bring it up; there might be some context i an missing. Maybe he miscalculated, maybe he isn't aware of tipping customs, maybe the wait staff was rude when I didn't see, maybe that's all be had on him and he was too embarrassed to say... If it was purposeful but unwarranted in my mind, I would leave it myself if he had paid for both of us. I am not sure I would if we had gone dutch. Either way, I would hesitate before going on a second date.
What are the best ways to get rid of facial hair like mustaches and peach fuzz?	Anyone have any options for A toddler? She has some hair on her upper lip that is a bit more prominent than I'd like because if medication she is on. Not gonna start waxing but wondering if there is something I can do	I get my upper lip hair and eyebrows threaded by a very good-looking Turkish man and swear by it. The first time is quite painful but it gets better after that, your eyebrows will never look sharper and the hair grows in more finely than before.
Women of Reddit who have had abortions in a committed relationship, how did it affect the relationships between you and your SO?	In the last 3 years I have had 2 abortions and one baby (yay!) with my current partner. They went abortion, baby, abortion. He is Catholic and is not a fan, but is also progressive and believes my body (and everyones body) is not his to dictate. He did not feel good about either abortion, but he loves me and respects me and my choices. He was sad and a little distant after each one, but I let him be and tried to respect his feelings. I guess this was mostly easy for me bc I felt very confident about my decision each time and I dont have a lot of hang ups about abortion in general, so I didnt really need a lot of support from him. It took some time (a couple of weeks) but he moved on and we are great!	We weren't ready for it. We both agreed we didn't want to be parents. The abortion was emotionally draining on us both, but it also brought us closer.
When have you run into an Ex and thought "I won." or "I dodged a bullet."?	She was dressed in the most sleaziest uncoordinated outfit I have ever seen. Fashion is the first thing I judge, so I felt better about myself after I saw her (her eyebrows were popping though).	My college bf had an issue with drinking too much and peeing the bed. "A phase!", I told myself. Recently (ten years later), I hung out with him and some old great friends at a wedding. He got wasted, passed out on the couch of my hotel room, got up in the middle of the night, peed in my luggage and denied the whole thing. At least he has graduated to the corner.
What's the worst gift an SO got you that you pretended to love?	A super tacky Coach coach ring...one with all the Cs on it in a thick band. They had so many cute things that year...I also got one of his mother's old Burberry head bands. I hate Burberry and detest headbands.	He got me Wendy's for Valentine's dinner. Actually, now that I think about it, he didn't actually buy it for me, he just* drove us there.
Dudes of Reddit, do you still have old reports from nursery/kindergarten and, if so, what did teachers have to say about you back then?	I was always considered the good kid. Sat quietly in class, did good in school. I'd say it only changed in high school when I became more confident and got more friends, did more jokes. High school was a good time.	I cleaned my basement a few weeks ago and found a report card from kindergarten. I scored a 13 out of 100 on my listening skills.
When have you completely overlooked a guy's signals?	3 years ago when this guy had a huuggeee crush on me and he was such a sweetheart but I liked him being my friend and not anything more. So he would always wait for me after class, check his breath by coughing in his hand and then smelling it which I just thought he had a cough haha, tried to be very close to me, and always stared at me. One time I was in lunch and I looked up to him staring at me from across the room and his face got all red. He was a sweetheart!	It's a slightly different signal, but for over two decades, I misinterpreted my husband's lack of coherent, logical responses to me in our conversations as indicators that he was losing respect and regard for me and our relationship. A year or so ago I really pushed to see what was going on, and he told me that he still is pretty much just thinking about my breasts whenever we're talking face to face.
What does the generic male dating profile have?	**"I'm a feminist..."** Yawwwwwn. At best, supporting feminism is bit like supporting a black person's right to sit anywhere on a bus. Bluntly put, neither position impresses me because, well, earning a dollar to a man's dollar should be something everyone supports. At worst, I might think he is the kind of guy who can't just suck it up that, while we have moved beyond gender roles in most of society, dating remains an exception to the rule. **"Hmu"** Just screams passiveness and laziness...not very attractive traits in a guy in particular. I'll gladly reach out to a guy first, but not if he expects a woman to do it.

Gamers: how do you find time to focus on your career, have a good relationship with friends/family/SO and still have time to play games?	I couldn't. And I realized that as life went on I was just going to waste more and more hours of it on something that will give absolutely nothing back to me. So I sold my system. Absolutely freeing, and now I use the time I would have wasted on much better things.	Moderation. Video-games are good entertainment, but they're still just that - entertainment. They should be used as a hobby or time-suck when you don't have anything else to do. It's an insular activity that doesn't really enrich you or make you better generally (though some games tell good stories or test your problem solving skills), so it's certainly not a bad thing to have better or more important things to do. I'm saying this as someone who really likes video games by the way. With work, a fiancee, my social life, and the gym, I don't get as much time to play as I used to, but the things I'm doing instead are either more important (gym, work) or more enjoyable.
Have you ever been to a topless beach? What was your experience like?	It was GREAT! The feeling of the cool breeze against my bare chest felt like nothing else. Edit: I'm a guy.	I've been to a full-nude beach in Austin with my boyfriend. It was a little weird at first, but after about twenty minutes of being just another naked person you stop caring. Being naked outside is awesome.
If you and your girl have spoken about marriage in the past, how would you feel if she sent you some engagement ring styles that she likes?	I'd feel emasculated. Like she doesn't trust me well enough to know what she likes (and what I can afford).	My wife picked her own set of rings out in the diamond district in NY. She knew what she wanted and the price range. Remember guys she is going to be wearing this ring for the rest of her life - let her pick it out. I had the money when I proposed and told her we would go the next day and pick out her ring. She got the exact setting and cut she wanted.
Married men of Reddit, what are some things that you are glad you don‚Äôt have to deal with from your wife/husband that others seem to have to?	I'm glad my husband doesn't have an issue with me being very close friends with other men and hanging out with them one-on-one. I'm friendly and attractive, so I make friends easily. I couldn't have a husband who was controlling in that way, but I see some of my peers dealing with this with their SO's and it's a nightmare, imo.	I'm really glad I'm not dealing with a dead bedroom after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids like so many guys seem to be.
Women who live/lived alone, what are your tips for feeling safe?	Weapons, and *knowing how to use them*. I keep my door locked and chained, a steel baton under my pillow, a baseball bat by the door, a wood club by my coffee table, various knives in every room. Plus two cats who talk at whatever is on the other side of the door and a dog that barks (or tries) at the slightest thing out of the ordinary. The one time a maintenance guy came in without knocking or calling (both are listed as "things you must do" with the office, because hundred pound girl living alone), I greeted him with a baseball bat. When he backed out of my apartment, I called management, my upstairs neighbor called management, and that asshole was fired.	When I did, I had a HUGE pair of worn men's steeltoed boots, biggest I could find, that were full of mud and just outside my front door. People see those and think, there's a gigantic dude who doesn't mind getting dirty in there...
What has a women friend, co-worker, class mate etc... said to you that caught you off guard and boosted your self esteem?	Earlier this week a security guard complimented me on my shoes. Lifted my day it did. Gonna hold on to that one for a while. It's probably the only compliment I will receive for the next 10 years.	I mentioned about being a little pissed that I had a disproportionate amount of work put on me and she said that was because I was the person in the company that people turned to when they needed to know the job would be done right. Still felt a bit pissed about it but that did feel good.
What is considered crossing a boundary in a relationship to you?	I don't care if you don't like that guy that I'm working with, you do NOT tell me who I can and can not hang out with. I don't care if you think my skirt is too short, you do NOT tell me what I can and can not wear. I don't care if you think I'm going to make the wrong decision, you do NOT tell me what I can and can not do. If he has a problem with that guy, outfit, or decision, talk to me like a competent human being and we can work out something together.	If you're doing something you feel like you need to hide or lie about, that's probably not a good sign.
What's the most oddly specific Bro Code article you can come up with?	Article 150: if you still refer to a "bro code" and you are over the age of 18, you need to grow up	If your bro dies while at the gym, first put some more weight on the bar, then call the medical personnel/ authorities.

Guys, how do you handle a woman who wants you to slap/hit her during sex?	I've done it, but I've found that it's more or less impossible for me to respect them or take them seriously afterwards.	Probably ask a clarifying question "are you sure?" and proceed gently until she describes how hard. This isn't really my thing, but if she's into it, then I aim to please. Better to start off gently than to hit her too hard at the start I think.

What was the most misguided way someone tried to impress you?	A guy at a party kept telling me he was retired. He was like 35 tops. All I could think was what a lazy waste of space you're being, go do something! Your total lack of participation or contribution to the world we all live in is the opposite of impressive.	I had gone to a service shop at a car dealer. When I handed my keys over to the guy at the front desk I warned him to be careful with the pepper spray on my key ring. He deliberately sprayed himself to show me how tough he was (iirc he had been in the military before) and stood there for a while as his face turned red and his eyes watered. The spray ended up getting in my throat a little and we both had to run outside.
Men who have/had therapists what's your opinion on it? Has it drastically improved your life?	Seriously negative. Saw two of them after a series of "horrible" relationships. Infidelity, manipulation, straight up abuse, you name it. And every time something terrible was done to me, I got to hear the same thing from friends and family: "what did you do to deserve it?" Enter therapist number 1 who explained to me that was correct, that when things go bad, it's a mans fault always. Conversation went like this: Her: you have to understand that a relationship is about a man making a woman happy. If he doesn't, that's where issues come from, and the relationship fails Me: and where is a mans happiness supposed to come from? Her: the satisfaction of a job well done Ditched that bitch, saw a second one, who confirmed the first one was right. Wow. INSTANT downvotes for calling male servitude to females horseshit. Never change you pathetic white knights	A good therapist is awesome. They can really help you put things in perspective. Especially if you have a mental illness, your brain will lie to you a lot. So a therapist can give you tools to help you discern the truth.
Lenin is a game played by an adult and one or more kids. Lenin lays down on a bed and pretends to be a mummy, kids quietly serve as Guard of Honor at the entrance to the Mausoleum (bedroom). Fathers of Reddit, what games did you invent to get your kids to do something?	Weren't father and son but I watched this new kid getting ordered around to clean the car and paint the fence. He believed to learn Karate that way.	My dad had me play firefighter. Where his trees were on fire and I just watered them for him with a bucket and the stream...
What is your "I'm the douchebag boyfriend story"?	I once dated a girl who I didn't find that attractive physically. She was really nice and awesome to hangout with though. I took her virginity, cheated on her with two other chicks, then dumped her all in one month.	I had a FB once who didn't have a car. She would get her "friend", who was obviously head-over-heels in love with her and her complete slave to drive her to my house for booty calls. The first time she made him wait in the car, the after that I let her invite him in and he got to play my consoles on the big screen while we banged. I've never had a dude hate me so much, but force himself to be so polite. I enjoyed that part as much as the sex, maybe even more. Not sure if this technically counts but it's the #1 story that comes to mind from your prompt.
When you are in a relationship do you still accept offers to have coffee or "hang out" with other guys?	Yeah, but only someone I am already decent friends with. I am bi so if my partners had issues with it, then i could never hang with my friends.	Depends. I have male friends with whom I drink coffee, go clubbing, everything. But if it's someone I just met I'd make sure he knows that I have a boyfriend, just to prevent awkward situations in case he was thinking about being more than friends. But when it's clear that I have an SO, I see no harm whatsoever in drinking coffee with a guy.
"Easy A" or "Mean Girls"?	I've never seen Easy A but I feel like I'm the only person in the world that doesn't love Mean Girls. I mean, it was cute and all but...meh.	How is this even a question? Mean Girls is the only correct answer. Easy A is funny but it's no Mean Girls.
What would you consider a "green flag" in a relationship?	ITT: People not understanding the question. "Flags" are not features that have a value of their own, they're indicators of possible presence of features with negative or positive value. In this case, I'd say: Undivorced parents Having a reasonable number (2-4) of close female friends. Pursuit of "caregiving" careers (teacher, doctor, vet, nurse, pedagogue etc.) Limited social media presence Lack of tattoos Involvement in a charity, especially a kind that doesn't yield maximum bang for your buck in terms of bragging rights	Something frustrating/annoying/bad happens and she doesn't complain or go to pieces, and lets it go without letting it ruin the day.
Fellow White Collar Ladies. Since the start of your career have there been any behaviors that you've intentionally adopted, altered, or killed off completely while at work?	I went from owning my own business to working for a large corporation. I've learned that there is a whole lot of social expectations and games that have nothing to do with the work at hand. It's more about relationships than quality of work, sadly. I'm was very direct, and didn't fake smile. That was heavily frowned upon for the women in my office. So though I work with all men in my department, I'm the only one that has to put on a fake bubbly act. Really fucked up. An older woman told me to "suck it up, if I had to do it so do you, fair or not".	I stopped using the word ‚Äújust‚Äù in my emails. Ex. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just checking in; I just wanted to see; etc. It is unnecessarily passive and apologetic. And you will notice men never use the qualifier.
(Serious) Conventionally attractive/beautiful women of Reddit: How do you usually react to compliments about your looks? Are they so common that you're numb to them, or are you usually flattered?	I think I‚Äôm pretty, but rarely if ever do I get compliments. Does that make me unattractive? I don‚Äôt think so, but I don‚Äôt base my value on what others think. If I feel pretty, then I feel pretty (oh so pretty! I feel pretty as witty and gaaaaaayyyyy! Sorry) (not sorry). But really, the only opinion that matters is mine. I‚Äôm the only one in control of how I feel, and I refuse to feel poorly because I don‚Äôt fit into society‚Äôs standards!	If it's "you're really pretty" , I'm flattered but, I honestly forget about it soon after. So I guess you can say I'm numb to it? But if someone goes into specifics, like "You have the most beautiful big brown eyes" or something like that...I'll think about it for a while. I guess when someone puts "effort" into the compliment, that makes me feel more special.
What‚Äôs the most common compliment you‚Äôve ever received?	"You have the best dresses" or something to that effect regarding my style. It must becoming very unusual for women to wear a dress regularly in the workplace, or at least mine.	Usually hair related compliments (I have very long hair). I enjoy the compliments, I get cagey when the compliments turn into touching my hair. [It goes something like this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QgQSlbjtKr4)
What do you folks think of the current Hollywood firestorm?	I guess it's good? But I don't think it's going to solve anything if industries keep being dominated by old boys' clubs that cover for each other. They need to make a rule that if a man is ousted from his job for sexual harassment, they need to replace him with a woman.	I have some hope that this trend of calling out sexual assault and harassment continues and in other career fields and the perpetrators are held responsible.
What's it like for a guy going through a break-up?	What sort of question is this? You seriously think that with the huge variety of relationships in the world, and the huge variety of men, and the huge variety in how these relationships end, that there's some standardized way men cope with it?	Depends on the breakup and the guy. Men tend to take breakups harder than women do, because they tend not to have a support network around them and/or the emotional tools and understanding to properly process the loss. What can happen sometimes is a guy gets his friends back, in the sense that a lot of guys stop hanging around their friends once they pair up. When that happens, it's kind of like someone coming back from a work probation or suspension: no animosity, but there's time that's passed. It's why guys tend to stay in bad relationships: many of them feel responsible entirely for their partner's happiness and the health of the relationship and will take personally (in other words, as "their fault") what might have or not have gone down.

How do you react when a girl says she wants to be just friends?	I don't even call this friend zoning btw. It's literally just that we didn't agree on something. And because I'm an asshole my thought process is partially fueled by why should she get all of what she wants, when I get none of what I want? That's a bad business deal.	At some point after, I let the line go a bit cold because my actual friends are expected to reach out to me too. These "let's just be friends" gals never do.
Boyfriend is quitting smoking on the 15th. What are some things that I can do to support him?	Tell his ass to be strong. Tell him not to be weak. Tell him how him being strong really turns u on.	For me, it was about eliminating stress as much as possible. Exercise helped a lot, but keeping busy is a must. I found that going for a walk when I had the urge was super helpful. Everyone is different, but I actually hated encouragement while I was quitting. My wife would tell me how proud she was, and it's great... But every time she brought it up I would get a craving. For me, it was like, let's not talk about it. As a final piece of advice, I'd say... Be supportive if he relapses. It took me 4-5 times to quit, every time I did better though! Good luck to him!!!
I need to know if my husband is being truthful-- how bad is the men's bathroom?	That's cute, he still thinks girls don't poop. Does OP really want to shatter the "sugar, spice and everything nice" fantasy?	Men's bathrooms are consistently ugly. They almost always smell like pee. They're often bordering on disgusting and it can feel like you can't touch anything aside yourself and be clean in there. Because of the urinal situation, you can openly witness poor hygiene regularly - people come in, pee, and leave with nary a drop of water splashed upon them. Women's bathrooms are usually better, but when something happens in there, holy shit. The stalls are often a disaster on their own. The kind of mess you want to set fire to and walk away; wholly inhospitable for human life. Source: I used to be a janitor.
Do you mind doing all the "heavy lifting" during sex? Why or why not?	In this thread: "I don't want a girl who doesn't do anything." Maybe if you were delivering the goods, she would be more animated. You have to give her a reason to get moving.	It depends on what you mean by "heavy lifting." Are you asking if I mind if my partner plays the submissive or pliant role while I take charge? No, of course not. We prefer it that way. Are you asking if I'm cool with my partner being effectively non-participating, non-vocal, starfishy, etc? Fuck no.

When you're hanging out with a female friend, what can you do to make clear that you're NOT a couple?	Can't believe all these dumb comments saying, "why does it matter", "why do you care"? Why does it matter? Because obviously it is a problem if not you wouldn't be asking for advice. Why do you care? Because some awkward and uncomfortable situation can arise from people confusing you for a couple. Besides that, you should't have to explain yourself. If you're asking for advice, then it matters. Saying "who cares" or "what does it matter" is basically like shitting on the OP, as if to say his problems or feelings don't matter. If you don't think it matters, then gtfo this thread.	Are you trying to make sure she knows you're not a couple or that other people know you aren't a couple?
Women who have toxic parents, how much did you include them in your wedding?	I'm not married but my boyfriend and I are both wanting to get married at some point. Our plans on a wedding always change so we're not really committed to the idea until we know what we both want. I've cut contact with my mother completely &, though I've never had a relationship with him, have never had anything to do with my father. They won't receive invitations to whatever I plan on having. They won't be told of it either. Luckily I don't deal with those "flying monkeys" so anything I do with my life rarely, if ever, gets back to them. My eventual wedding is for my boyfriend and I, not people we don't want there.	My situation is complicated because my dad and I are close, while my mom is toxic, and they're still together. I'd love to cut her out of my life completely, but it's not feasible while maintaining a relationship with my dad. Currently my plan is to invite them, but not accept any money from them, and it's likely that one of my friends will be assigned to run interference and keep her away from me as much as possible.
You're the main character of the last film you watched--Can you tell me about your story without revealing the movie title?	i'm a studious girl who doesn't know how to lighten up, and my boyfriend left me for a beauty pageant winner. now i have to show him and everyone that i can actually be just as good as those types of girls, and i'll stop at nothing to show them all.	I grew up on a small farm, and became the first of my kind to be police in the big city. I had to really fight to get respect, and I made some silly rookie mistakes that were blown out of proportion which lead to me quitting the force and going back home, which made my parents happy. I ended up going back to work the case with a petty criminal friend of mine and ended up unwinding the racist conspiracy and became an integral member of the force.
What's your most unique hobby?	Pedantry alert! "Unique" is an absolute modifier. There are not degrees of "unique". Something either is unique, or it isn't. Something cannot be "most unique". "Unique" is solitary, singular. Were unique to be plural, or multiple, it would fail to be unique.	I started welding (hopefully as a career) and blacksmithing as a hobby, forging and making my own knives. Here was my [first one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/1ypi64/first_forged_and_first_completed_knife_done/) I like being able to make something from nothing, also, pounding and shaping yellow hot steel with a hammer and anvil is just plain fun.
Men who had an awesome ex, why was she awesome and why is she your ex?	They're ex's because they lacked values I'd say they were cool however, the word awesome is reserved for a very select few individuals in my life, an ex would not be one of those individuals.	She could make me feel like I was the only man in the world with just a look. Always asked questions about topics she was curious about. Wasn't afraid to have incredible discussions on any subject. Always said good morning and goodnight to me every single day. Made me feel welcome in her home, as if I had been part of the family all her life. Always praised my accomplishments and pushed me to be the best version of myself I could be. Loved travelling and was extremely passionate about anything she put herself towards. Was an absolute goddess in the bedroom. Left me for another guy the day my mom passed from cancer.
What is something completely petty that has made you smile in the last 24 hours?	Someone had once learnt I have a crush on him and had used it then to tease me and made me feel I am being inappropriate. He texted me the other day that he would love to take me out and do me when he is in tow. I let him know I have someone right now. But I felt all smug about the whole thing.	Got a notification that someone in my contacts list has joined LinkedIn. Turns out it's my ex boyfriend. And it turns out that in the 4 years we haven't spoken, he's done sweet fuck all with his life, at least professionally. Hasn't held down a job for more than a few months at a time and his current position involves manning the coat check at a conference centre. Meanwhile I've gotten a great job, considering my second career step, and my life is moving forward. It's suuuuuper petty but like ... Dude was a man child. The fact that he still hasn't gotten his act together kind of proves the point for me and is pretty satisfying.
Those of you who didn't know what you'd do after high school or college, where are you now?	about to blow a mexican midget tranny in the back of my 92 ford escort for 6 dollarz of gas money	Lots of shitty retail jobs. Joined the military. Got direction in my life. Got out and had them lay me to get my college degree. I was unsure if I wanted to go back to do federal work or private company. Took a job in Manhattan in digital marketing. Loved it but something was missing. So, I became a cop and love it. Some people need time to come to understand what they want to do in life. I am one of them.
Inspired by AskWomen: What qualities/actions stand out most to you in women?	Athleticism. It shows they care about their body and are strong mentally. And most athletic women I‚Äôve found aren‚Äôt that into drama, so that‚Äôs always a good thing	Not sure what to all this, but it's something like 'good-heartedness'. It's the little things like recycling, picking up pieces of litter, holding the door open for someone with children, being a passive driver, not getting impatient with cashiers and other service employees, thanking people often, not letting one rude asshole ruin her mood, etc. You can't really quantify it. You won't find it in a dating profile. But when you see it, you notice it. And it's wonderful.
Men, have you ever gotten down to it with a girl, then immediately been turned off? Why? By what?	I was getting freaky with a girl once, then pulled down her panties and saw she had a full bush, even down to her asshole. It was revolting. I don't require perfectly clean shaven but that was just nasty	Pussy stank. It was well beyond normal vagina smell. That fucking thing smelled so bad that I began dry heaving and I actually am not easy to gross out. I just couldn't. I actually felt bad for her because she understood what was happening.
How pathetic is it for a 20 year old man to cry because of his mom?	Your mom is a piece of shit human being and her existence brings down humanity as a whole, even if only by a little bit. She needs to be signed up as an organ donor than put down.	No. Crying and admitting emotion does not make you any less of a man and will definitely help you grow going forward.
Americans of AskMen - what's something about Europe you just don't understand?	Why don't you like redheads? Is that really as prevalent as the internet/media makes it out to be? Dudes with red hair are just dudes to me, and women with red hair are instantly hotter. ¬Ø\\\(¬∞_o)/¬Ø	How do Germans flirt? I have lived in the country and I still don't get the body language of flirting in the country.
Women of reddit. If you could change one decision you made this year, what would it be?	Moving to a new city and committing to a guy I met 3 days in. I had no support and his family embraced me and helped me with my son while I was working nights. I was never in love with him just loved him. It went on for 9 months, too long. I finally made the decision to break up with him, ultimately crushing him, his mother, and my 8 yro. And he wouldn‚Äôt let me keep the dog we ‚Äúhad together‚Äù that he bought on Mother‚Äôs Day that I had been wanting for months. My son and I miss his mother and the dog more than him.	I would have worked harder to find a job that suited me. No one should find themselves in a job they want to quit after only a few weeks. I feel like my college degree is useless when my job could just as easily be done by anyone with a basic knowledge of data entry
On dating sites, how do you feel when the girl's profile says something like "Don't email me if you are a jerk or a player"?	i message a lot of females on dating sites. 100s of hours 1000s of messages and zero replies. guess im just too ugly.	"My name is Kate and I love to have fun and I'm looking for a decent guy (if that exists) to have fun with. I'm a full figured woman and I'm proud of it, looking for a man who can handle a real woman. If you want some fake barbie go away. I don't do drama. I'm not like other girls. So if you play games look at another profile. Im livn at my mothers but thats tempererery. Don't message if you are a jerk. Don't message unless you are 5'10. Don't message me if you don't have a job and a car."
Ladies, what weird or gross shortcuts do you employ when getting ready in the morning?	Most of these aren't gross at all. Especially the hair washing. Its good to wash weekly or less for most people if it's not full of products (oily haired individuals may adjust to less frequent washing after a couple of weeks). If dry shampoo was that gross, why do they sell it? I maintain that peeing in the shower is disgusting, but it's not that far out there...	Do women have the same rule as most of my dude friends: if the jeans do not have stains on them, the jeans are not dirty?
What is the best drugstore beauty product you've purchased?	My sister once bought this face cleanser with sulfur from Germany (I think) that was *amazing!* I've never seen it since :(	Milani lipsticks are my all time favorite. They have three lines (Color Statement, Moisture Matte, Amore Matte Lip Creme) and I love all of them. The staying power and shade range is something I'd expect from a much higher end brand. I'm also super impressed by the Color Icon Blushes by Wet n Wild. I don't think I'll ever hit pan on the one I have. It's so pigmented that I barely have to tap my brush on it to get enough product.
Dad's of reddit, Were you prepared for what you witnessed in the delivery room when your child was born?	2 kids,.. not prepared for the first,.. tried not to be present for the second. its disgusting. love the kids, loved my then-wife, but just nasty.	My wife had a c-section, and no, I was not prepared to watch people open my wife up and a whole ton of blood to be everywhere. It was all mildly concerning, but I figured the doctors knew what they were doing.
What is it like to be wanted by women?	If it's your first love that left, and you never really got over her, and now it's 4 years later and she wants you more than you want her it makes you feel like a fucking god. It's like cocaine, but much cheaper and longer lasting. And now we're dating.	Great, if you're attracted to them back. Uncomfortable if you aren't. Though there's a definite ego boost either way. I imagine that's probably how it is in the reverse too.
Mothers of girls, what are some things that surprised you as they were growing up?	Disclaimer: never been pregnant but speaking from the context of being the very first grandchild who happened to be a girl. My parents received a crap ton of ultra feminine frilly Sunday dresses and all my aunts old barbies and dolls, expecting me to be this ultra girly southern princess haha. Turns out I hated playing with dolls and preferred hot topic t-shirts. It was a weird pressure to deal with as a young kid but now it's just a funny story that still gets tossed around.	Mine is only two weeks old, so I'm looking forward to this thread immensely. One thing that has surprised me so far: did you know newborn girls can get tiny baby periods? I freaked out finding small amounts of blood in her diaper, but apparently the hormones from birth can get into their systems and cause a miniature period in the first few days of life.
What is something people list as a red flag about a woman but you don't agree with it?	I'm baffled by the number of people who make statements on the internet about how fat women "don't take care of themselves" or "let themselves go" or "don't care about a healthy lifestyle." I mean, I realize the media tries to sell us that message, but how can you know and interact with actual human beings and still hold these beliefs? Look at the fat women out for evening powerwalks, swimming at the Y, shopping at the health food store . . . How are all these healthy-living fat ladies invisible to others?	If she doesn't have a lot of friends or if she doesn't go out often. I have a small handful of friends and they're quite busy. We have our own lives and our different schedules. They rarely, if ever, go out and drink. I don't drink because I lack alcohol tolerance. I'm actually quite social at work and in my neighborhood. I'm just not the one to go to bars with girlfriends. I keep myself busy through hobbies. (I'm an "ambivert".)
Married men of reddit: what was your favorite thing about your wedding?	Didn‚Äôt get into debt for one day, didn‚Äôt have a massive fuss, I wore what ever the fuck I wanted, including shorts, converse and a SnapBack.	Lots of things but one decision we made that in retrospect I‚Äôm really glad we did. They had us go to a back room while all the guests were filtering in and they had all the buffet food there for us. We had like 10-15 mins to eat before going in because at a lot of weddings the bride and groom don‚Äôt have a chance to sit down or eat
How can I (F20) demonstrate desire for my bf (M20) before I'm ready to have sex?	"Oh man, I'm so hungry right now!" "Oh, you want to eat some food?" "Nah, I'm not ready for eating yet."	You definitely need to talk to him. If you're worried about it and you think he might be bothered then you should. Do you see yourself in the near future being ready to move in that direction? If so, tell him that. Have a straight forward conversation. Something along the lines of "I'm really enjoying our relationship and I'm pretty certain I want to take this further with you, it's a whole new experience for me, and I really appreciate you being patient with me..." Maybe throw in some cute lines along the lines of "I can't wait to experience those things with you" IF that is how you feel. My gf and I had a somewhat similar situation. Communication is key.
What wine do I pair with grilled cheese?	I would seek out your local homebrew shop, find out if they have an adventurous community forum, and ask if anyone has a bottle of tomato or beet wine. If in the pacific NW, there's a pretty good chance you'll be able to barter for one. Otherwise, a yeasty cider is the best suggestion I've seen so far. fruity, to complement the cheese, bready to pair with the bread, and acidic and carbonated to break up the grease in your mouth.	cheap pinot grigio. It will cut through the grease, and then you can afford to have two bottles. I used to like to drink mine out of that one plastic tumbler in the back of my cabinet because all of the other glasses are dirty.
Seriously, what do I need to teach my son about cleaning his penis?	I'm circumcised and I just kind of lather it and wash it, no further work needed ~~If he's uncircumcised then I think he just first needs to pull back the skin, wash, rinse and then let go. Maybe lightly dry it with the skin back? I don't know~~ I guess I shouldn't have answered the second part	Also for both circumcised and not. Don't try to put soap in the pee hole. I tried this when I was about 4, and I regretted it. It's painful. Just don't do it.
Do you have a preference on the gender of your gynecologist? Why or why not?	Hey everyone. I wanted to remind the community that this is an ask reddit, meaning people ask the community a question and the community responds based on their own experience and opinions. That means this is not a debate sub and attempts to argue with specific users by [invalidating their responses, or derailing the general topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/wiki/rules) will not be permitted. If you find yourself wanting to debate about discrimination or whatever with a respondent because of about their preference for a female gynecologist over a male one, I'd recommend not doing that, and instead asking yourself why you chose to argue with that person instead of one of the many respondents who said they prefer male gynecologists. Edit: thanks, /u/YourDreamsWillTell on catching an error, no thanks to Grammarly for failing me	Hey everyone.

Do you feel that there should be stronger criminal penalties for falsifying abuse/rape?	I don't know if putting them on the sexual offenders registry is the best solution. I think something like sentencing them to do community service (like maybe at a woman's shelter, where there are real survivors of abuse) and forcing them to better the community would be a better option than wasting more tax payer dollars on prisoners.	Definitely. If someone falsely accuses someone of rape, that should of course be dealt with as a serious issue. An accusation of rape can ruin someones life, just the accusation on its own, so if someone falsely accuses, they should face a penalty that takes that into account.
Men who have a significant other that was "wild" back in her younger years; how is that working out now?	Do you want me to link divorce stats? You'll find your answer there. Here you might find white knights and unhappy people trying to spin their failed relationships. Edit: Was it a white knight or a strong empowered woman who chose to go through my comment history to downvote away? I don't think it's going to help your self-esteem. Edit edit: I'm loving all the excuses and denial. It's like a fat kid stuffing cake in his mouth accusing genetiks of making him fat, because the cake tastes too good to be bad for him. "I want to sleep around so it must be good for me!!"	My sister was a drug addict and alcoholic in her teens, hit rock bottom around age 18. Plenty of sleeping around at the time. Got clean, has been clean for the last 15 years since. Met her husband 10 years ago in Narcotics Anonymous. They have the most beautiful marriage and their relationship has been pretty flawless since day one. They are the most adorable couple and their kids are cute as hell. This is probably an outlier case to some extent. They both clearly grew up years before they met and they both were always fundamentally good people. Results not typical. My stepmom was a wild one who was fundamentally always irresponsible and self centered. Things went a lot worse in her marriage to my father, and her abuse problems were her demise.
Who did you think was "the one that got away", only to find out later they were a bullet you were lucky to dodge?	My first boyfriend. I "cheated" on him (gave a blowjob to one of his friends before we got together officially, after we started texting). He called me a slut and God-knows-what. I was hurt and cried a lot. Looking at it later, he was a very lazy, spoiled, uneducated brat. He didn't have any ambitions or goals in love. Yes, I had strong feelings for him, but I was dumb back then as all teens.	My first high school boyfriend. I moved out of state and broke up with him because I thought the distance was unfair to him, didn't realize at the time how emotionally manipulative and abusive he was. Was hung up on him forever because I really cared about him and how "I'd never find anyone who could love someone like me." He got another girl pregnant within a month of our break up, got into hard drugs, openly cheated on all of his next girlfriends and was accused of raping several girls before 22. Bullet dodged like fucking Neo.
Ladies who have had a son, has having a son changed the way you view males? If so, in what ways?	I'm the mom of 3 glorious boys. I never wanted children, and then wanted girls. Being the mom of sons has made me realize, one of the most important things a woman can do in this life, is to raise a man. My boys are the majority-white males. Raising men who are feminists in their own right, who adore and respect women as their equals, and who will stand for what is right is an important task.	No, but having a brother had probably the biggest effect on my life and maturity. In general, men are just as complex and emotional as women, and anyone who disagrees is near-sighted.
Ladies, have you ever ended a friendship because you felt like you were doing all the "work"?	Yes. Well, not cut off completely. But I got real tired of it. She won't talk to me about big stuff and I know she doesn't have anyone else to. I'm actually glad that she got let go from her last job, because I was scared for her. She worked with a whole bunch of men and she's the kind that likes attention, and can't distinguish boundaries. I wish she would have talked to me. I keep asking for her to hang out and ra never a good time. It's very frustrating on my end because I want to be a good friend and I have nothing but time!	I just stop initiating and let it fade out on its own... I don't think i'd ever make a formal declaration about it, that just seems weird to me
What has been the most misogynistic thing you have experienced?	Anytime I tell someone I'm not interested in marriage or children, they said you will give it time. No I'm pretty sure I won't be changing my mind now or ever	I was on the elliptical at the gym I used to go to. It was a very small community college gym - 3 treadmills, an elliptical, a bike, and one TV. I was the only person working out and there was a Yankees game on the TV. I love the Yankees - even spent my honeymoon at the Baseball Hall of Fame. So I was actually *watching* the game. A guy walked in and asked if he could change the station. I said no, I'm watching the game. He then said "yeah, right". I said "I'm a Yankees fan". He made a noise like "pfft" and said "ok, then name off all the players". I said ok and started naming off my favorites first - he interrupted me and said "those are just the *popular* players" and walked away.
Just found I'm pregnant to a guy I was seeing for a few months, I now live in a different country. Do I need to tell him in person?	I don't have much to add in general, but reddit's pregnancy community /r/BabyBumps is fantastic. Please check it out. Very awesome group of ladies (and gents!) with good advice, very little prejudices (some, but that's every group), and a great mix of lifestyles and backgrounds.	I literally got a map and compass out, calculated with a circle how far a fifteen hour flight would be from my location to if any of those countries matches my exes current location. I don't think it's you unless it was a really slow plane.
What's the appeal of cumming on a girl's face? And what do you want the girl to do while you do the deed?	I have almost never done it in many years because my wife occupies this dignified pedestal in my eyes and she is also the mom to my daughter - so it is always vaginal pump üòá However, I have dated two women in the past who were absolute freaks and I‚Äôd pump it all over their faces with one hand holding the hair in a bunch and the other spraying it all over and then whacking the face with the cudgel üòÖüëå Some women bring out the worst in you because of how they conduct themselves ü§ì	Some dudes love it when their partner is so into the sex that they'll do anything, they just want more of you - and those dudes will often happily behave the same way in return. Other dudes get a quick thrill out of what they perceive to be their partner degrading themselves out of desperation. It's a whole light/dark spectrum.
Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who recently came out of a relationship, or who quit their previous relationship to be with you? How did it go?	I have dated several men while they were going through divorces (wow, weird, maybe I have a type). It was fine. I have a tendency to overlap relationships, anyway (I haven't been partnerless since 1997, so...yeah) and I don't think it's necessary to have a specific amount of time to be single (and, to be honest, I tend to date men who fall the fuck apart if they are single).	I'd been treated like dirt by the last couple of blokes I'd been out with, and late night messaged my friend to vent about how miserable I was. Co-incidentally he had just broken up with his girlfriend the night before. We more or less decided to pity fuck each other. He was very upfront about not wanting a relationship, and I felt so broken and discarded that I just let it be a casual thing, because I honestly had no strength. However the sex was life changing, so we just kept at it. I remember one day months later he just grabbed me and kissed me and said 'I can keep my hands off you', and I knew something had shifted. It's been two-ish years now, and we have a house and an amazing future together.
Men who didn't like themselves as younger people, then became high-self esteem individuals - HOW?	Oh I still hate myself, I've just become better about repressing it into a little ball of festering, stewing self hatred that I fear will one day reach critical mass.	Hated myself growing up because of toxic family/never had friends after middlescool/some other stuff. Fast forward, I was told I had avoidant personality disorder. Realizing it helped a lot, but the biggest boost was just pretending I was a confident normal somewhat social person. I literally lied to myself and to others about being a good person when I thought inside I was literally Hitler. Apparently Fake it until you Make it can be a pretty true phrase. I'm a somewhat well adjusted person now and pretty god damn confident in my self to boot. TLDR: Have you tried not having low self esteem?
What weird things does your pet like?	Where do I start?? Bastion: chews cables, cardboard, hair ties, eats ribbon, sticky tape, string - you name it, he's probably tried. Zelda: likes her tummy rubs. And she loves the strong petting she that my brother gives her. To the point that she will race to the other side of the couch and up the scratching post to be right in front of my brother for the pettings	My dog loves to eat leaves. She goes crazy over them! Any leaf, old leaves, crunchy leaves, brown leaves, leaves still on the tree. Just pick one up and wave it at her and she will get super excited and jump to get it. It's fun watching her run at full speed, spot a leaf, and try to grab it while still running, lol. [Picture!](https://i.imgur.com/xx6FliW.jpg)
Is it rude to presume a gift will be given at a Renewal of Vows, and to specifically ask for cash because you "have it all"?	I'll repost my answer... I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People have birthdays every year and other still tend to buy them presents... So I don't think expecting that some people would give "second wedding" gifts.	Yes. Super presumptuous. I would not in a million years bring a gift to a vow renewal, and the assumption of getting one would be insane to me. I can see certain guests bringing them because hey, event, let's be nice to our friends, but.. to assume that everyone's gonna bring one and hey actually guys, just money will do? That is some *craziness*.
How to deal with dead arm from gf massive head??	It's called having a girlfriend. Enjoy it. Numb arm from pillow-use and suffocating from gf's hair during cuddling are very typical things in RLs. That said, if you actually are concerned about your arm feeling more numb than it healthily should, move it out and just hug-cuddle her instead mate. They don't typically complain about that.	Do you have a face full of hair and an awkward boner too? Those are the other vital interactions to a proper snuggle.
Mods of r/AskMen, what are your pet peeves about modding for this subreddit?	Honestly, besides the dickheads who can't just have a good time and try to push their shit or be a dick to other people here... It's when I get a good kick going... modding hard for a few days straight, clearing the modqueue, answering modmails, baleeting FAQ and trollposts by the millisecond... and 3 days later a drunk /u/nickachu_ is bitching to me in Slack about how shit my action numbers are, and I am an old has-been burnout. K.	Honestly, besides the dickheads who can't just have a good time and try to push their shit or be a dick to other people here...

K.
If you could pick one question to be permanently banned to be asked on AskWomen - which one would it be and why?	Probably the questions where a guy asks about approaching women. Not because the question is bad but because the replies are always filled with rants detailing how all women absolutely despise being approached in public and how no men should ever dare do it because you‚Äôll ruin a woman‚Äôs entire day by saying hi.	Women who are 23 what advice do you have for women who are 22? Do these people actually think someone who is 1-5 years older than them has that much more knowledge than them? You‚Äôre in the same age group.
What is wrong with my friendship with women?	You're the emotional dumping ground for your female friends. They come to you to get the emotional attention that they need, and then go to other men to get the sexual attention. I'd hazard a guess that you deal with a lot of their emotional crises instead of their boyfriends, correct? its just human nature. They're maximizing their available resources, as I imagine that every now and again you buy them things or provide other benefits. The reason they're doing it is because you let them, and odds are you no leverage to demand more.	Did you enjoy the musical? Do you enjoy hanging out with these women? If so, why does it matter? Your male friends don't have sex with you (I assume), but you still do what would be labeled "lame shit" with them. Don't take doucher comments so seriously.
Have you learned something disappointing (not a deal breaker) about a SO early on in the relationship? How did you handle it?	He got a tattoo. Knowing I am vehemently against tattoos. It's not a deal breaker, but oh my god it was so disappointing. Still bothers me when I see it, but I'm working on it.	You all are talking about all this serious shit and I'm here in my happy corner with my boyfriend who hates pie.
Women of Reddit when is still living at home a red flag?	Taking care of ill family is about the only reason I'm OK with it. If you want to save, get a few roommates, don't leach off your parents. I'm very independent and have a lower threshold for this than just about anyone I know. I find people who live at home after high school truly pathetic.	Context. It's more important to me that you're *capable* of living on your own. Life skills, as you called it.

Please feel free to continue to report rule-breaking content. &#x200B; **Please Report All Rule-Breaking.** &#x200B; **REMINDER: No one gives a shit what your dick thinks.

What are you an elitist about?	Clothes, especially shoes. I try not to be a snob about it, but it's tough when friends keep telling me about the "awesome" new thing they bought, and asking what I think of it/how it looks. It's usually pretty bad/shabby/cheap, and I refuse to lie about it, so the best response I come up with is silence with raised eyebrows. It's not a *great* response, but at least it's not, "That's tacky and I would be embarrassed to wear it."	Design. Holy fuck, does bad design piss me off. Several times a year, I get a Chinese menu delivered to my house that is rife with bad photoshopped images, poor spelling and on one occasion, you had to turn the menu upside down to read the last two pages. Ugh. Additionally, when good design is held back by something like shite kerning or garish colour schemes, that's the worst. Yeah, I'm weird.
How much attention should you expect from your girlfriend in a group setting?	I hate this too OP. There's a quote from downtown abbey I'll botch but it goes like "I know I'm not the most impressive man but I want to marry a women who thinks I am." Be with someone who is crazy about you. Not someone who is willing to be with you but lukewarm when it gets down to it.	Talk to her. I personally am ok with her giving me the least attention because I get a ton of attention from her anyways and it's nice to know she has friends besides me.
Anyone here ever meet a girl that was everything you wanted personality-wise, but nothing you wanted physically?	The whole "it's the personality that counts!" is such enormous bullshit; if there is no physical attraction present, you're doing both parties a disservice. When I extricate myself from my own predicament I might share my experiences/war-wounds.	yes. It's horribly frustrating. I feel like a horrible person for being so shallow, but I want to be massively physically attracted to the person I'm with. I can't tell you how it ends. I'm in the middle of it now.
What's an unusual deal breaker that you have?	I dont think these should be unusal, but seeing how much people complain when I mention them, I supose they are: 1. Lives with parents. 2. Lives with roommates. 3. Doesn't drive. 4. Drinks or smokes at all. 5. Has kids. 6. Wants kids. 7. Thinks he even *might* want kids some day.	You just reminded me that I once broke up with a guy because I realised that side-on he looked like my brother and I found that too weird! As for unusual deal breakers, I guess I really hate tribal tattoos and will probably assume bad things about you for having one if I don't actually know you.
Men. Why types of men can you simply not stand and why?	I call them Dad-jokers. They're guys that say an unending stream of mediocre dad jokes, puns and double entendres, mostly around women in an effort to be funny. The problem isn't the joking itself (then they would be comedians and actually interesting), it's that 80% of the jokes are bad and bring nothing to otherwise interesting conversations.	Guys that are huge know it alls, trys to educate everyone, but literally has no idea what they are talking about. Had a dude in my college course that would sit and roll his eyes at you if you answered a question wrong. Someone would say something and he would fight you to the death saying it was wrong. He got below a 70% on all of his tests and literally passed the class by 1% with assistance from our lecture teacher. Everyone hated him.
What are your observations about what parents do right and what parents do wrong when raising girls?	right; almost nothing? wrong; over sexualization, controlling behaviors, slut shaming, controlling what they can and cant do with their own body, selling them off to an adult male at the age of 12, using them as a mini parent, dumping all chores on them, etc etc	Sexualizing young girls. I teach parenting classes, and this is rampant. Examples, not allowing their daughters around the opposite gender, not allowing fathers to take part of raising the child, and having a fit if they do some child-like behavior such as running around and their underwear happen to show. I tell parents all the time, we as adults are grown and have a sexual lens of life. Children do not. And the rate that we hypersexualize our girls is really damaging.
What weird thing do you find sexy about yourself?	I have scars all over my body. People around me have always insisted me on getting it checked out since the scars are freaky as fuck but eh, the scars fit my lean body perfectly.	I was born with an underdeveloped nerve in the brain that limits some facial movement. I can't smile with my teeth showing, but because of the limited movement I'm a really good liar and can deliver sarcastic humor well. My doctor said I won't get typical face wrinkles from this. I love my "perpetual poker face." Edit: not sure if it's related but I can stick my whole fist in my mouth.
What would be the best/most useful superpower to be able to use during sex?	A hand that turns into a vagina so I don't have to deal with women to have the nice feel of a vagina on my penis	My wife and I could shapeshift to anybody we want. **Me:** Hey hun, how about......Katy Perry tonight? **Her:** Ok, sure. You be Chaning Tatum. **Me:** Ok! So should we record this and sell these tapes? We would be rich, and get to fuck anybody we want without cheating.
What's your 'the one that got away' story?	I met her at a concert for one of my favorite bands, it's to date the only time I've ever gotten a date with a stranger I've met in public. We had the most romantic date I've had, we went to a Beer-Wine-Cheese-Chocolate tasting room, then we walked around the park, and right as we kissed for the first time the sprinklers came on. She was beautiful, she was intelligent, and she was driven. I fell head over heels and got way too excited about things. One night I was a total creep and came on too aggressively. I stopped as soon as she said she wasn't interested, but I'm pretty sure that I ruined things that night. I still think about her and I really regret acting the way I did and leaving her with only knowing a shitty side of me.	Our mothers were friends, so we grew up knowing each other. In high school we were both interested in each other, but too dumb to say anything or read the signals. I moved away for university and the next year he enrolled at a university 20 minutes from mine, yet still nothing happened. The last time I saw him he showed me a giant canvas and said we should paint something together. I feel like it was a Nicholas Sparks romance novel waiting to happen, but now we live on different continents.
Alright, I've gotta ask my fellow Reddit ladies: Do you sleep with socks on or without socks on?	I can't sleep without socks on, I'm a weirdo. I don't like my skin touching when I sleep for some reason so I'm always in socks and leggings.	Without. I sleep nude (or in just underwear when I'm on my period). I would hate sleeping in socks. My toes just need their freedom, I guess.
Have you ever met or dated someone that you thought was nearly perfect except for one (or a few things) that became a deal breaker?	Yup. She was pretty much everything I wanted... extremely attractive, seriously intelligent, funny as all get out, introspective... We dated for months and were really smitten with each other and the sex was great. We were having a discussion about gender issues one night when she revealed to me that she firmly believed in bullshit "patriarchy" theory and how easy men have it. After all of my life's struggles I just could not abide someone thinking that I had it easy because I'm white and have a cock.	Yep. She was hot, intelligent, had the same sense of humour and made it clear she was very attracted to me. The problem was that she was seeing about three other dudes at the same time, one of which was her ex, ending in her going radio silent. Welcome to online dating.
So, it looks like Britain has officially voted 'Leave' in the 'Brexit' referendum-- AskWomen, what do you think?	I'm ecstatic. In the long run, it will be a great move for Britain. Brussels should do some deep soul-searching on what is happening as the world moves toward greater autonomy and self-governance. I'm very impressed that the Brits were able to see the long term benefits and rejected the fear mongering projected by the global corporatocracy benefactors. Yeah, UK!	My only hope is that this will drive Scotland to reconsider and leave the UK. A big reason for them staying was because they wanted to stay in the EU, and now they're out anyway.
What's a recent purchase you're really excited about?	Most recent: a tank top that says Hakuna Matata on it. Most excited: my friend got me a pre-order for a book coming out in October for my birthday. So, I'm excitedly waiting for October for my birthday present!

So, I'm excitedly waiting for October for my birthday present!
What was it like when you first moved in with your SO/Spouse?	I tell him I'm always in honeymoon phase with him. He is wonderful. We have been together for 5 years and living together for 2. Love coming home, giving him a kiss, and relaxing together.	It was pretty amazing. It was like we were both competing to be the best roommate. I'd bake stuff, he'd clean extra things, I'd do his chores and he'd snuggle me for ages. We kind of figured out things as we went along and never had any issues. When the newness wore off, we just kind of settled into a rhythm. But we still did and do all the nice things for each other.
What makes you feel beautiful?	My boyfriend. I‚Äôve dated a handful of guys seriously, but it wasn‚Äôt until him that I realized how perfect I tried to be before. He loves me when I look homeless & reenact The Grinch. He loves me when‚ÄùI don‚Äôt feel like showering.‚Äù He has loved & helped me through being sicknesses & surgeries. He loves me when I‚Äôm an emotional wreck. He makes me feel so confident when we are out cause he‚Äôs just so genuinely proud to be with me.	The stage of air drying your hair where it‚Äôs not really wet anymore, and it‚Äôs not damp, but it‚Äôs not quite all the way dry and is in fluffy, pretty waves. It‚Äôs so soft and still a little cold from the residual moisture.
What "percentage" of yourself do you share with your gf/bf? And why is it that much?	Usually almost 0%. It's been a long time since i had a relationship that survived a year. Intimacy takes a long time for me. Probably the last 3-4 relationships i've had were short lived in part because they felt that i never let them in. That's fine with me though, in the end they proved not to be the right people to open up to.	I directly reciprocate the amount shared. Occasionally I will offer something to try and spark some intimacy on some subjects like something about my past or maybe something about the way I am feeling, but this is a rarity. I am a much better responder than I am an offerer when it comes to discussion.
If you could go back and enjoy your 20's what would you differently?	I would not have smoked weed. From the age of 15 - 20 i was smoking every day for most of the day. It took me over 5 years to rebuild my confidence and social skills. I still suffer from anxiety issues.	As a 21 yo guy going through the comments, I think I should reconsider what I'm doing with my life right now.
Mothers of reddit: During pregnancy, did the size of your baby correlate with your overall body size?	No. Baby size correlates most strongly with poorly managed gestational diabetes. The higher the blood sugar of the mum, the larger the baby. Ease of delivery has more to do with the mum's pelvis than overall height and weight of the mother. My mother had an easy time of it and I did as well with a completely intervention-free birth. I am a large person, being 176 cm tall, my husband is 188 and our two children were both >95th percentile for length and about the 75th for weight, IIRC. My daughter was 7 pounds 11 oz, my son was 8 lbs 11 oz.	I'm 5'8 and weighed 240 when I got pregnant. I weighed 280 when I gave birth. My son weighed exactly 6lbs. My good friend is about 5'4 and maybe 140lbs. I have no idea how much weight she gained during pregnancy but her son weighed over 9lbs. She gave birth to him vaginally. In a bathtub. At her house. With no pain meds. I give her mad props.
Ladies of AskWomen - Have you/do you ever make assumptions about a man based on the car he drives?	When I'm driving and pissed off, these are the following assumptions I make: huge giant pick up truck = dude with small penis nice sports car = old dude shitty looking car driving slow = someone who looks like a hipster douche SUV tailgating me = uptight looking female (usually on her phone)	If there's something that stands out, yes. If it's just an average car, nah, whatever. **Student with really nice car:** "Wow, I didn't expect that. Must have been a birthday gift, 'cause I'm pretty sure he's broke." **Student with shit car:** "Ah. Typical student car. Probably got it third-hand from his grandmother. But hey, it runs!" **Guy with crumpled car:** "Ouch! Looks painful. I wonder if he got in a crash." **Guy with very big car:** "Woah. Dude must have insane parallel parking skills."
What does male sexual desire feel like?	You know, I've never thought about this before, but to sum it up... I feel a bit warmer If I'm particularly aroused, might dick actually feels... tighter? Just due to it expanding so. I might even describe that as almost sort of feeling sore. Maybe some sort of gut sensation as well? I don't really know.	Female reading this thread and I am totally flummoxed. None of this sounds remotely like female sexual desire. I am super interested. More posts please. Edit 1: What I am hearing sounds way more like what I think about when I think about *food*. Edit 2: What is absolutely bizarre is that none of you are talking about what specifically is happening to your bodies. Your outward actions and thought processes are being heavily prioritized over physical sensation. This is so NOT analogous to how I would describe female desire.
What‚Äôs the best thing you‚Äôve said to stop unsolicited d!$&amp; pics?	Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt get unsolicited dick picks? Or any for that matter...? Hubby really needs to step up his game üòâ	A guy sent me a pic of his dick when i was like 16 and then asked for pics of me, I told him I was 11 and needed to ask my mum if it was okay first. He freaked the fuck out
I'm worried that I'm turning into the type of person who needs to tear others down to feel better. Have any of you ever stopped being bitter?	May I suggest you wander over into r/raisedbynarcissists? Edit: I think you would benefit from the perspective of knowing it's not in your head and you're not an ungrateful daughter. You'll find some good resources, as well as support and s safe place to vent. Good luck :-)	I find what helps me in this regard is to stay off social media. Social media can turn people's lives into a spectacle and I find it colors me against people I typically would have neutral feelings towards. Don't spend hours in their lives. Move away. Meet new people. Look for 3 good qualities in everyone you meet.
Men of Reddit, how many of you grew up in the 2000's and what do you miss about it?	I miss not having to worry about it saying hi to a girl was sexual harassment, I miss how you state an opinion and not be called racist /sexist /problematic simply for disagreeing, I miss the country not being in debt and having a somewhat Dane president from time to time, and I also miss North Korea not being a global threat. On a lighter note, G4 TV, mother fucking power Rangers, Dream cast, and good cartoons (now days every cartoon has to be some sjw liberal agenda with a Trans gay lesbian otherkin, I grew up with the power puff girls and they had a cross dressing demon lobster thing named Him and literally no one cared because they were an awesome character but all this forced diversity is really going to back fire in a big way)	I miss when YouTube was a fucking insane playground with no rules. Tourrettes guy, early smosh, dramatic groundhog. All of that shit came to be because no one fucking knew what they were doing. Now, there's so much formulaic bullshit on the site that nothing really stands out.
What's the nicest thing your (current or ex) SO has said to/done for you?	"I love you with every atom of my body and you can do no wrong." (which, you know, is silly, because I can) But still. This came after a shameful admission on my part, something I was kind of afraid to reveal, and although he understand the dark part of my personality that this involved, he was so loving and accepting of my past fuck-ups. He's knows I'm not perfect, and he loves me anyway.	My dad is pretty much housebound. I was at the hospital taking my mom off life support, and my husband realized that no one was with my dad (my dad also knew he couldn't take being there when my mom died: personal decision I completely respect). My husband packed up our little one, went over there and watched movies with my dad for the day. I hadn't even asked him. As long as I live, I will never forget that.
Women of reddit, today I was told I have sexy forearms. Is this a thing? Do women really pay that much attention?	I like forearms. Good forearms tend to be attached to good upper arms and good hands and...yeah, well, you know. Anyway, I'd guess that the complimenter was trying to say something nice but not sleazy or weird about you.	Strong arms in general are incredibly sexy and a huge turn on. I know a lot of girl who feel that way.
What do you admire most about your mom?	When I beat her for burning my chicken tendies, she usually does a better job for the next month or so. She's trainable.	She grew up in a small town where nobody went to college. She was abused growing up, so she married right after high school. He abused her too. She divorced him and went to college. Now she's a doctor and has been married to my awesome dad for 30 years. She is a symbol of where hard work can get you, and she's an awesome mother.
Why do you want to be with your current SO?	I had a horrible childhood with detached and unloving parents. Had a thing for bad boys. Got my heart broken a million times until i decided i will choose the nice guy. He made me feel safe so I married him. We have a son together now, but i dont love him anymore. Im still here because of my son.	I love everything about him, good and bad. He is an incredible, adoring, and present father to our twins. He is just so in love with being a dad that it makes my heart sing whenever he's with them. He is unfailingly kind and compassionate to all others, and he will do anything he can to help anyone who needs it. Every day he makes me laugh - we can sit and do nothing but talk for hours and I'll be laughing the whole time. I also feel loved, respected, and *valued* as an equal partner and person. He never tries to restrict or confine me, he is happy for my success and encourages me, he sees my thoughts and opinions as equally important as his, and I always feel like he sees me. He gets me. Also he can make a killer apple pie.
What do you think men should "get over"?	After extensive clean up, it appears clear that the rule\-breaking behavior by people who can't stand not derailing, invalidating, "not\-all\-men"ing, or "what\-about\-the\-men"ing in response to this post will continue to make this post a nightmare to moderate. The rules apply to you too. In today's "this is why we can't have nice things" shining example, this post will remain locked.

Men who have been discriminated against, what happened?	My genitals were cut when I was a day old because I was born male. I've spent too much money on lube for masturbation. Trying to explain to my uncut son why mine is mangled causes him too much distrust for doctors.	High school counselor didn't want to let me take Calc BC because it "would be too hard for me". I'm Latino and I was super pissed she wouldn't let me sign up even though I met all the requirements. My high school was mostly white kids and hispanic (mostly mexican) kids. Ususally you only saw white kids in AP classes. After bugging her enough she finally let me sign up. Made sure to get high scores just to prove her wrong.
I want to have more in-person. female friends. Where did you meet yours?	I mean, there are a lot of steps to take before this one becomes necessary but having kids will make you a lot of friends. Easy conversation starter too - talk about how far along you are at lamaze class and next thing you know you're out for egg-white omlettes and virgin Bloody Mary's complaining about how awful MIL is over what to call the baby. Before you take that step, though. What about an exercise class? Perfect opportunity to meet people and small-talk over how sore you are.	I'm in the same boat. I moved to a new city about 4 months ago, and got a new job. I am the only female in my office, and don't do too much besides go to the gym. Meeting friends has been much harder than I expected.
Hey ladies, who is going to the Women's March on Washington and where are you coming from?	I am sure I will be downvoted but....No. This march doesn't represent me or what I am feeling after the election. I also feel the amount of fundraising that could be accomplished with the same vigor could go toward meaningful changes.	I won't be in DC, but I'll be going to my local march in support of you guys, and yes, there are marches happening in Canada too.
Why don't men get as much of a thrill over fictional romances as women do? Men fall in love too, so why don't they enjoy a good love story? And if you do, what are your favorites (TV, books, movies)?	It's boring as fuck, and reading/watching hundreds of pages/episodes is way too much work to bust a nut. Watching porn is alot easier and more entertaining	Aren't a lot of cheesy "guy" movies fulfillments of what you're asking? Guy gets the girl after intense trials of his abilities of the subject of the movie. Off the top of my head, diehard, dodgeball, shrek, etc. I can't think of any movies off the top of my head where guys are the object of pursuit from women other than movies that are strictly aimed towards "strong females." I could just be drawing a blank here.
Women of Reddit, what was something your SO did that made you want to kiss them immediately after they did it?	Every night before bed my fianc√© says "Kisses?" It is super cute, and he always gets what he asks for. :)	I'm currently going through a rather nasty throat infection. Even though he's working this weekend, my boyfriend brought me breakfast in bed and while I went to wash up, he lined up all my morning meds and a glass of water so I don't have to go rummaging for them. It's little thoughtful things he does that make me melt. <3
Redditors love to bash women for having standards, but what are some ridiculous dating-requirements and double standards that men have for women?	TIL My Wife should be eternally fucking grateful for me. She was a virgin but I didn't care either way. She doesn't wax/shave with any sort of regularity, I don't care. She has long hair and the only time I gripe is during sex and it's all in my face because it's hard to keep a rhythm going or stay in the moment when suddenly Chewbacca. She used to shave and trim everything but got tired of it and each time more time would be between waxing and shavings and I'd just be like "I don't care. Pussy is pussy." She's got nice legs, hair and all.	With the guys I dated before my current SO, I noticed an expectation that I mingle and spend time with their friend group while they have no intentions of doing the same with mine. They might meet my friends once over drinks, but they would never want to hang out on the regular with my friends. Meanwhile, sometimes the only way I could see them was if I was going to hang with their own friend group.
I'm 22 and I just found out I'm pregnant. I'm having an abortion. How should I mentally prepare myself?	I'm so sorry you're scared. Do you have a supportive close friend to go with you? It might help to have someone with you. Also wear a hoodie and sunglasses if you want some anonymity. Sometimes there are nasty protesters outside, but just remember that this is one day in your life, and it will be over just like every other difficult day you've had. I'd also get some delicious treats and indulge in something nice for yourself afterwards.	If you live in Miami or Fort Lauderdale and have no one to go with, PM and I'll accompany you. Don't be scared for being a responsible adult and making the right choice. You'll be fine :)
What are your unpopular opinions about food?	Not quite an answer to your question because I kind of like everything. I'm actually having trouble thinking of a food I don't like or will at least eat. However, a lot of my friends are vegetarians. Like the kind that constantly post videos of animals being slaughtered on Facebook along with sad sounding music and commentaries on how inhuman it makes me to eat meat. I still like my fois gras. They can all shove it.	I don't like warm, or even room temperature fruit. I like my fruit to be cold, especially if you bite into it and there's a juice.
How to have the awkward "I'm taking this girl home, so I'm ditching you bro" conversation?	1. There is no such thing as a bro code only stupid people believe in such a thing. 2. Just say hey I'm about to go home with her bye. Then leave.	"Hey bro gotta go get some pussy, here's $20 for the uber back" Literally no guy i know Would be mad
What is something your SO once told you and it still pisses you off even thinking about it ?	"i will never love anyone more than i love my mom" he called and tried to take it back a few days later but the damage was already done.	My SO told me that he would have no problem breaking up with me if he met a girl who he thought would be better for him. I understand what he was trying to say, like he would break up with me before ever cheating on me but the way he said it really stuck with me. It made me insecure and jealous of whatever other girl he was interacting with. He's very particular about who he likes and even girls I know he'd never go for, I still felt that terrible feeling. He's no longer my SO. For that and a list of other reasons why I broke up with him.
Potentially getting a small apartment with my girlfriend, Men what is your best advice on making it work?	She is going to put her shoes, makeup, bags and whatnot everywhere. Set boundaries and 'I just have more stuff' is *not* a valid argument. Take turns cooking, but who cooks, cleans up. That way, you don't have to clean up after she spent a day having fun trying out new recipes.	I say just make sure you get some you time. Don't spend 24/7 with her. Get out with your friends without her.
Women who grew up watching Disney princess movies. Do you feel that these movies affected how you thought of relationships or how a woman should be treated?	After reading some comments turns out I have never seen Beauty and the Beast, it sounds fucking creepy. I just assumed all Disneys were viewed. Huh, wonder what else I have not watched? Pretty sure GOT has sought out any princess dreams I had, would still take a dragon anyway though	They gave me unrealistic expectations about wild animals being my pets and/or helping me with my chores. That's about it.
What's the shortest amount of time you've spent at a job?	Donut shop. Two days. The donuts were free but we had to record every soda. Cups had bible verses written on them. Got a pamphlet about the founder going from being a homeless man to donut mogul by the grace of god. I left because my back started hurting from standing around all day. There were like 20 people on my shift, wasn't worried about it. No regrets. 19 year old atheist me needed something more interesting, easier on my weak lanky ass, and less preachy. edit: didn't read the whole question.	3 days. After watching the owner of the machine shop I got hired at berate an employee, I realized the owner doesn't care about his employees or even retaining good employees. So I quit.
In what ways do you "bully" (jokingly) your pet?	All the time. I remind my derpy male cat that I already performed the ultimate misandry by taking his balls off literally. He usually just mews at me for treats after that.	He always gets "hungry" and starts meowing when I walk into the kitchen (even if he's just eaten), so if he meows too much I start giving him frozen veggies. He looks so excited for food then instantly disgusted.
What's your best "Don't let crazy stick his dick in you" story?	Is it weird that I went through the thread to see if anyone was talking about me? I'm pretty sure there is only one girl who might call me crazy, but we never had sex. Was just curious if any of the others thought I was crazy, and I didn't realize it.	He cried after I sucked his dick the first time. He went home and prayed about it with his mom and fasted for three days. His conclusion was that it was okay if I wanted to suck his dick again because he was going to marry me, but we were 17 and I had no intention of doing either.
How have you failed at being an adult lately?	I stayed up until 5 last night playing League of Legends and slept in until 3 in the afternoon. It reminds me of my teenage years.	I did my laundry at my parents' house last Thursday night. All of my t-shirts are still on the living room floor, waiting to be put on hangers so they can be hung in my closet. I keep looking at them, and I know it'll only take like 15 minutes, but I just really don't feel like it.
Online Women Shoppers, what are a couple of the best websites to buy clothes?	Like cheap clothes ? I usually use wish.com and then I usually order from forever 21 it‚Äôs way easier to shop online than in stores	I'm a big fan of Uniqlo. Their clothes are super reasonably priced, but the quality is 10x better than Forever21 or H&M
Fat guys who have little-to-no trouble dating: What are your tips for your chubby brethren?	Op Lose about 90 lbs minimum. The rest of you: just be in good shape x study psychology and sociology, people watch, learn a skill, go out A LOT, try new things, mediate, just stay out as long as you can.	Former fat guy. I think it's worth pointing out that being willing to go out with fat women will *drastically* increase your results, but I wasn't willing to do that, so I'm not sure how many other people here will.
What is the most downvoted thing you've ever said on Reddit (if you had to guess) and why do you think it was downvoted?	Juuuust a reminder that we don't allow linking to non-archived comments/threads from other subreddits. You can mention the sub and you can quote the content but no links plez! **Edit:** Also remember not to downvote to indicate disagreement because it's hella stupid when people do that for threads like this (or any thread, really).

So guys forget about all the bullshit, what is some dating advice you personally have felt is important?	When you pull up to go knock on her door to take her out, you lock all the doors on the car. Then you walk her to the car, use your key to unlock her door for her, open it for her, and close it for her. Then you walk around the back to get in and you watch to see if she leans across to unlock the door for you. If she doesn't, you dump her and dump her fast. This is the point where she's being on her best behavior, being the most considerate she may ever be and its only downhill from there. If she's not willing to do this small thing for you, she's no good. My wife passed the door test, and we're solid. Just saying.	Figure out the difference between a bad occasion and a bad situation. Not every relationship is worth sticking around for, but not every negative is worth ending things over either.
(Stolen from r/AskWomen) When did you realize that you were dating an asshole?	When he would make everything about him when I was bringing up a small issue. Then he‚Äôd say I was ungrateful and cuss me out and then ghost me. Would come back a week later and pretend like nothing happened. Apologized for saying hurtful things but then kept doing it over and over.	She got pregnant and we hadn't had sex. She tried to guilt me into paying for the child and then blamed me when she ultimately aborted.
How often do you take "Mental health Days" off from work?	Never. I call in sick maybe 2-3 times a year because I'm actually sick. I've probably called in sick to a job about 10x in my entire life, the whole "personal day" thing doesn't sit right with me, I've always felt a pretty strong sense of duty. Now that I'm in health care I know that calling in sick might screw over my coworkers if they can't cover my shift, which in turn makes everyone have a shitty day. Edit: "Calling in sick" when actually sick is obviously warranted. "Calling in sick" when I'm not sick and just want a personal day, as the thread title suggests: no, I don't do that, it would feel dishonest and wrong to me and it's not something I do.	I get paid by the hour so I'll take a day off when they force me or when I die
What's the meanest or rudest thing you did as a kid because you didn't know any better?	I was in first grade and was learning Spanish colors. My family took me to a restaurant and I saw a black couple... I pointed at them and said "Negro Negro!" excitedly. I then got explained to why that wasn't exactly appropriate.	My family didn't have much money when I was growing up. Hand-me-down clothes, small apartment in a bad neighborhood, etc but I attended a small private school where my mom worked. Her employment there allowed me to go for a deep discount. All my friends were rich white kids. I was probably about 6 years old and I asked for a toy, my mom told me she had just paid rent and we couldn't afford it. I SCREAMED at her in the middle of the store that she could work harder so we wouldn't be poor. My mom worked 60 hours a week to give me a good education. I'll never forget the look on her face when I said that.
How (and why) did you and your SO choose which side of the bed you'd sleep on? Do you ever regret your decision?	After a scary incident while we were in Amsterdam, my man sleeps the closest to the door. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether we‚Äôre traveling or even at restaurants, he‚Äôll sit facing the door so he‚Äôs aware of who comes in and out. He loves to say ‚ÄúI am your protector therefore, I want to make sure you are safe and for that to happen, I have to be your knight 24/7, 365 days of the year.‚Äù	He gets warmer than me so he gets the side closer to the AC. I get up more to pee (stupid bladder) so I get the side closer to the bathroom. Works out well for both of us!
You're at a job interview and they ask you, "what is your weakness?" - what would you answer?	Stealing money and giving out trade secrets. You know when I am just standing there next to money I just can't help throw tons of it in my pockets and when someone ask me about confidential information I tell them in detail, you know to help them out, also I enjoy a good helping of sexual harassment in a work place so if people seem calm I will grab someones butt to put them on edge, you know normal weakness /s	I want to figure things out on my own and sometimes have trouble asking for help. I address this by giving myself a time limit. I have 20 minutes to figure this out and if I don't have it by then, I have to go ask questions.
What kind of shoes do you guys wear?	Asics. See, most companies have an aversion to calling any of their customers fat. Fatties are a bigger market than people with wide feet. Fat feet and wide feet are very different shapes. So most shoe companies' "wide" shoes are really fat shoes. Asics is the exception.	Adidas ultraboosts, for when I know I'm going to be walking a lot. Otherwise I stick to white casual sneakers, like Stan smiths, Nike killshot 2, chucks etc.
What is the best way to compliment women you don't know?	I used to do that. But then feminism happened, and I understood that I was actually raping them. So I stopped.	I'm not a woman, but I've found that complimenting specific things go farther than "you look nice." Example: "Your eye shadow looks great. Matches your outfit well." I think that this stuff works because applying this stuff is HARD. (I just recently started french braiding my girlfriend's hair. She burned her fingers and couldn't do ponytails while they were healing, so I took over. French braids look really, really nice, but BOY OH MOTHERFUCKING BOY are they hard to get right the first *n* times around. Damn straight I'll compliment anyone woman or dude that nails their braid, especially if they did it themselves.) This is how women do it with other women; friendships are formed over this kind of stuff
What‚Äôs the most creative complinsult or backhanded complement you have ever received?	A guy at college knew I had a major crush on him, but he was into larger ladies. All the boys were talking about what they found attractive in women while we were in a group at lunch, and he singled me out and said "I'm really not into really skinny girls like \_\_\_\_". I was upset because he didn't find me attractive but as a person on a permanent diet I was overjoyed.	‚ÄúYou look like a comic book character drawn by a horny teenager‚Äù. To this day I get both amused and creeped out by that phrase.
What small change have you made in your life that's helped to make you into a better person?	Honestly I'm a man and this may seem slightly stupid but the smallest change in my life that's made me a better person was my first love from high school waltzing back into the picture and I've only just shared one encounter with her and it was a great night it was reminiscent, romantic in some ways, and overall truly heartwarming, been six years since we dated and thought I was truly over her and now after that night I have enough motivation for everything I want to accomplish in my life to motivate every other person around the world, the point of this silly story is to point out to you ladies that you all have a wonderful powerful magic that pushes us men passed the boundaries of will power and I am simply grateful for you all. That is all!	Don‚Äôt speak while a friend is talking to you about something serious, just wait, and when you think you‚Äôve listened long enough to interject, wait some more. It made me more empathetic and a much better listener
What are your real life "Cat Person" stories?	I have a story I tell my friends about this guy I slept with from high school where after every fact I share I can follow it up with, ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve just left‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt know how to say no. Thankfully he was a genuinely nice guy, it just was wrong chemically and physically and I chalk it up to a learning experience	The biggest one for me was a DJ who lived with his folks. He seemed so nice until it became obvious that his niceness was an act. An act put on way too srongly. When I brought him back to my place, he was cute and I did want to have sex but... It was not good. He treated me like a piece of meat, a "sex doll" , as the story put it. There was no emotion in the act other than this guy playing out a porno fantasy in his head. I was afraid to tell him that none of his efforts felt good. Because he didn't make me physically cum everywhere, (really not an important part of sex to me) he felt the need to apologize and torment himself relentlessly for hours about not being man enough. .. One of the most exhausting nights of my life.
I (male) am spooning with you, a female friend, I develop an erection. Women; can you tell?	Yes, but I would be more concerned about the random boners you get when you're sleeping. Nothing like rolling over and being poked.	Listen, ain't nothin' wrong with a good ol' fashioned spoonicorn. That being said, yes, we can tell, if you press it against our warm, soft, lovely female bodies. If you choose to leave a gap, a boner gap, we will be none the wiser.
How can I stop putting women in a pedestal?	Learn to masturbate. Rub one out before you interact with a woman - then you won't have your judgement clouded with the little head	Behavior: you know what the habit is. Stop doing it. I have a rule where I send a maximum of two messages. If they don't respond, I don't send any more. Psychological: my guess why you put women on a pedestal is because you don't feel you have much to offer. To that end, do whatever you can to make yourself interesting, and make yourself close to the person who you want to be. Pick up as many responsibilities as you can. Only good things will follow.
What is a strange prejudice you have?	Every time I see someone who lives in a city where most of their peers have pets, they have time and health to take care of a pet, but don't have a pet, I see a much higher chance of them being selfish and/or immature people. I'm being unfair but everyone I knew in that situation really turned out to be selfish, I can't help it now.	The multi-level marketing stuff that comes up on my facebook newsfeed makes me wayyyyyy angrier than any other sort of facebook post. The latest thing is this supplement stuff called Thrive and they all post about how they have so much energy now even without coffee. I got so annoyed by it I looked up the ingredients, but now I have to resist commenting that they're literally just taking caffeine pills.
I believe paternity leave should be equal to maternity leave in terms of time, pay and rights. What do you think?	It's unnecessary. The mother needs time to heal. The mother is mostly needed in early childhood. It's been that way for millions of years. Early man didn't stop hunting because he had a kid. He did what he had to do to care for his family. This is just a new trend by entitled assholes that want to get paid to not work and stay home with their video games.	Female here. In Canada, the woman has to take the first weeks (I'm not sure how much), as basically recovery time. Pregnancy ain't easy on the body! The rest of the year of leave can be split between the parents as they see fit.
What is the loneliest thing you have ever done?	Besides masturbate, this one time I was incredibly hungry after working out and rowing for a bit. My only roommate home over break with me gets up at 4:30 a.m. so he went to bed and left me too hungry to sleep so I decided to go get some food from a bar and then ordered a pizza. Glad I got food, but it would've been great to have some company.	A month after my divorce, I went to a TGI Friday's for supper by myself. It was Christmas night. I brought a book.
Do any of you ladies feel miserable the week before your period?	Not an answer, but I remember I once asked an ex of mine a while back: > Wait... does PMS stand for Premenstrual or Postmenstrual Syndrom? Her answer? > Yes.	I feel like I wanna hump everything. The days leading up to the start of my period is usually when I masturbate the most. How does this effect my SO? Well when I have a SO its usually the best week of his month because I wont leave his dick alone.
Stolen from r/askwomen with a positive twist. Men who work in a female dominated career, what's the best thing you've been told or experience you've had with one your coworkers?	I'm an adjunct professor in an English department and I guess the best thing I've been told by a female coworker is that she doesn't plan to teach next year. A lot of the female adjuncts are married, and once they realize how shit the job is and how little they need it, they bail. Hopefully that gives me a little bit of job security going forward.	I work as a teacher in middle school - split is approximately 3 male teachers to 18 female. I had three different female teachers tell me that I was doing a great job connecting with students and to keep up the good work. Made me very proud.
Women who have gone to college: who was the most pretentious person you met there?	Why does it have to be a guy? One of the most pretentious people I ever met in college was a female professor who screamed at the staff in the department office for switching out the waiting room furniture.	I was running around in the rain, tossing a frisbee with some friends, when a guy walked by and grabbed our frisbee once it had dropped. I didn't know the guy personally but it was a small school, so I knew he was in a frat and on the ultimate frisbee team. Really preppy, blond, Ken-doll attractive. He's just standing there with our frisbee, examining it, so I ask if he wants to join us. He goes, "No, this frisbee isn't official weight. I don't want to damage my skills." And then he places the frisbee back on the wet ground, because even one toss of our inferior disc would have grievously de-calibrated his arm.
I keep hearing all those birth control horror stories. Does anyone actually have a good experience with going on the pill?	Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects. Sex drive is terrific, no depression (even though I'm a risk group), no weight gain. And while I believe each and everyone who suffered side effects from the pill, I also feel like it's just very trendy right now to condemn it. But for so many women it's the best form of contraception, otherwise there wouldn't be so many using it.	Yes. No babies, little period symptoms, no side effects. Sex drive is terrific, no depression (even though I'm a risk group), no weight gain. And while I believe each and everyone who suffered side effects from the pill, I also feel like it's just very trendy right now to condemn it. But for so many women it's the best form of contraception, otherwise there wouldn't be so many using it.
How do you deal with feeling like you're behind your personal timeline?	Just wish I decided on my career and graduated at 22 instead of 25. I felt like I lost three years of great income and would be debt free and even maybe $100k in the bank right now. But I know that I was meant to take the route that I did. And if I lost out on three years then who knows how the end of those three years would have really ended.	I used to complain about this to my mum all the time until she told me there is no timeline. There‚Äôs however many billion people on the planet and we can‚Äôt all do the same thing at the same time. There‚Äôs no schedule or timeline. What‚Äôs late? What‚Äôs early? Compared to whom? Or compared to what? Wherever you are right now is exactly where you need to be and nothing is off schedule.
What does it feel like to get a girl pregnant?	as a man, having sex with your wife for a planned pregnancy is one of the most demeaning experiences you will ever have. a lot of men will say the same thing	Depends on the girl, I would assume. Me and my wife were trying for each and every one of our kids... so, it was pretty exhilarating. If it wasn't intentional, it might have been more terrifying. I will say that with all of my children, initially holding them was terrifying. It doesn't matter how many newborns I had held, I was always terrified that I was going to hurt each and every one of them. Don't get me wrong, I held them, and I was/am an involved father to three wonderful kids (if you can call a teenager a kid... at least she's not driving... yet). But they are always so tiny, and so fragile. I was always terrified that I would do something to hurt them.
What is your passive income stream?	I make dog birthday cakes. Well, I've made *one* dog birthday cake. It's fun. After materials I profit a whopping $25-$50 dollars, depending on the concept of the cake. I also make menu plans. I only have 2 customers, but they pay me about $50 for a general plan. It's time consuming because I have to get a lot of health history and I do it all VIA e-mail. If they want to meet in person they can, but people seem to not have time for that, so if they fib about their height, weight, measurements, activity level, etc. my plans aren't always effective. Then they need to you know, actually follow through with them.	I make apps and put ads in them. I make about $5/year from that. I'm a (not very good) photographer. I've submitted some photos to stock websites. I've made about $2 so far. Rakin' in the dough.
Has an ex girlfriend ever told you years later that they still had feelings for you? If so, how did that make you feel?	Yea like fucking all of them because I just roll back through exes and haven‚Äôt seriously been with a new girl in a decade. It makes me feel kind of awesome. They go away they see the world and as much as ten years later want another shot with me. I guess I‚Äôm not so bad. Clarification : I never have bad breakups. Almost always circumstantial or we just drift apart and agree to move on.	Yeah, my ex who cheated on me 3 times decided to message me a whole year later with a massive paragraph on how she fucked up and wanted me back. By massive it had to be sent in 3 messages because it exceeded the character limit in iMessage. I just read it, then deleted it. Fuck that bitch.
Did you ever get involved with a multi-level marketing company? What was the result?	I "sold" Mary Kay. I never actually sold anything, but i kind of loved it. My director is a great person, my sister's were awesome and i have everybody great presents that year. No regrets and would totally do it again. Love their products. But, i can see how if you didn't have a supportive team, but had people putting pressure on you to buy inventory instead, it could be an expensive nightmare. But, i lucked out and had a great experience.	I sat through three hours of an eight-hour seminar before realizing it was a pyramid company. I decided to leave after they asked us to provide a list of everyone we know, along with phone numbers and mailing addresses. The product was cleaning supplies.
What is a "yellow" flag for you in your relationships?	Apple products (or other only-for-looks ones like Beats, Razor, et al) a sincere interest in fashion technical incompetence EDIT: FROM THE SIDEBAR >>>> ###Downvote only to indicate that either a comment or post does not add to discussion; not to indicate disagreement. AskWomen benefits from honest answers with a variety of perspectives.	Too close of a relationship with his mother-I dated two different guys when I was younger whose mothers depended on them for a life and dealing with a constant meddling mother sucks. Their last relationship was really messed up-I'm 36 so a lot of guys I date have had long term relationships that went south. For example, one guy broke up and got back together with an ex he still spoke to more times than he could count. I assume he may get back together with an ex or he would rather walk out the door than work on a problem. Last minute cancellations with lame excuses. I let this one go about twice before it becomes a deal breaker. I've been a litigator for 10 years. The BS excuses some men expect me to buy is insulting.
How do relationship fights affect men?	In the Myers-Briggs scale, I'm a T-thinking, but I feel very deeply, strongly. I just make decisions by thinking, not with my heart. That being said, when having a conversation/argument that involves emotions, it takes time to process that because when I channel emotion, I'm like a fire hose. It's all or nothing :D I don't trust myself to argue emotionally because it can get ugly quick.	Simply put: for a lot of us, it takes time to process. For me, I need time to fully process emotions. I'm not the most in touch with them at all times. And also, I often realize later something that I wish I had said then, and if I deem it important enough, I'll want to bring it back up. Edit: also, it does affect us. I always feel slightly sick after a fight.
What's the best NSFW compliment you've ever received?	An older female coworker (she was like 20 years my senior) had a habit of slapping my ass playfully. I like to think it was because she liked my backside.	The first time I went down on my girlfriend her immediate reaction was a genuinely surprised "Oh!" followed by "why are you so good at this?" It felt good.
What male stereotypes are you sick of hearing?	That men think about sex every 7 seconds. The truth is, women are as horny, or probably even hornier than men.	"Guys are terrified of commitment and only want hookups." No, the guys you hook up with just don't want to date you.
Is there a stranger you once met/saw that you sometimes still think about? What is the story?	OMG YES. So, I used to live in Hamstead,London and I always had to take the tube home passing Camden. This one saturday night I took the last tube home and this absolutely beautiful girl got on the tube. She looked like a fairy. Her skin was so pale, almost white and absolutely perfect. She wasnt wearing any makeup, black hair, black clothes. She looked so fragile, her bone structure was just, unbelievable. Honestly I tried to not stare at her, but I couldn't help myself. She honestly looked like a goth fairy. I remember wanting to know about her, wanting to get to know her. Its been 2 or 3 years now but I can't forgot how absolutely beautiful this girl was.	Yeah. When I was 17 I was at work and saw a woman receive a phone call on her phone. Within 10 seconds she had collapsed onto her knees repeating the words "No, please no oh my god" while crying really hard. Thankfully someone was with her. I witnessed her receiving news that probably really impacted her life negatively and I've never been able to shake it. I hope she is doing well.
What's your most memorable fart?	Once I farted on school and someone pointed it out but I didn't know what a fart was back then	Back in Primary school I tried to muffle a fart against the seat. The hard plastic seat. Instead it became the loudest, most high pitched fart I've heard to this day. edit: a word
What's pissing you off right now?	Just.....the sheer willful ignorance, and the sheer numbers, of people on the radical left. I know I should just ignore it, but dear tittyfucking Christ, the atrocities against logic rile me. And it‚Äôs depressing as fuck. How can we ever have any cultural harmony in this country again, when so many people stick their fingers in their ears and scream when presented with an opposing viewpoint?! And don‚Äôt get me started on the self-righteousness. I just mourn for our culture. And, since I‚Äôve committed the heresy of being an open conservative on Reddit, come at me with those downvotes.	Thanks for this, I been looking for an excuse to vent. My goddamn friends haven't hung out with me in two months, including my birthday. They hang out with all their other friends, but they can't be bothered to either invite me along or to accept when I ask them to do stuff. So... at this point... fuck em. I deserve better.
What aspects of life from a woman's perspective are men most unaware/oblivious to?	The constant level of thinking about everything that goes on in a woman's brain (meaning all those identified as such as well). We never stop thinking, ever.	When you're standing at your co-worker's desk to discuss a project and you suddenly feel a blob of uterine lining slip out of your vagina and have to make sure nothing in your expression gives it away. So weird.
What is your favorite Studio Ghibli movie?	Ghost of fireflies, spirited away and paprika. I thought the sibling situation during the war was pretty sad but I also remember the music they played during the movie too as a kid. Spirited away felt like a lot of fun to watch it gave me more hope for the better and paprika just felt very magical and colorful. I liked the while dream sequence of it.	Spirited Away! I have 2 tattoos of No Face (one is holding Gudetama lmao) and aim to fill my legs with ghibli and other animated icons Edit: The reason why is when I was little I watched the full film in Japanese and didnt understand a word but felt connected to the film the entire way through. I remember the exact feeling and smell of the evening, and when I saw the first spirit boat arrive I had never felt so captivated on a sensory level by a film before.
When was the last time you saw a guy cry? What was your reaction?	When I broke up with my last boyfriend on our 1 year anniversary. He brought roses and champagne to celebrate. I broke up with him and we both cried, drank the champagne together and then he got his playstation and left my appartment. It was pretty intense!	My SO and I found out that my great grandmother lived a block from where he grew up. I'd visit her often and we likely played together as children. He suddenly realized that this meant I probably met his mom who passed away about 11 years before he and I met. We both teared up and just sat hugging one another for a bit.
Males that work in female dominant environments; what are some of the things that have happened where if the roles get reversed there would be uproar?	I used to work in a call center in a fortune 5 company. The ratio of women to men what about 70% women to 30% men conservatively. Before I transferred, it was about the time that the horrendously written 50 shades of gray came out and became popular. I cannot count how many times I saw women reading that book at work. While most could choke through the writing or get past that the main character never had an email address even though being in college after 2010, at the heart of it, it was basically erotic literature. If I a male, brought in porn, even a playboy, I would have been fired immediately.	I got slapped on the ass a *lot* when I was a waiter. The only other male waiter was a really old dude who didn't play like that.
Men whose idea of a handshake consists in crushing the other person‚Äôs hand, what are you trying to achieve?	We're not crushing. It's called a firm handshake. I immediately disrespect anyone with a weak handshake. If I gave a weak handshake, I would expect no respect.	I don‚Äôt know why this happens, but I‚Äôll give you a work-around. When you go in for a handshake, you want that little bit of web between your thumb and index finger to hit the same on their hand. Really get in there deep with the shake. It will keep your hand from collapsing.
(Young) Japanese Men of Reddit, Why do So Few of You Date? What Factors Are Keeping You Out Of Long Term Relationships?	Not Japanese and not male but thought it'd be cool to add. The Japanese language apparently doesn't have a phrase for "I love you". The phrase they use is more like a "I really, really like you."	I'm japanese, born in Japan, raised and currently living in Canada. I never really got this meme of so few of Japanese youth dating. Its moreso they aren't getting married and starting families. All of my japanese friends (~18 yrs old) have been in at least one to two relationships, and I'm currently in a relationship. Seems like japanese people are especially reserved around new people or outsiders to their group and take time to warm up to them. Especially japanese girls. They're like the polar opposite of western girls who are instant best friends literally minutes after they just meet. It could also being the culture that promotes obsession about whatever interests you, be it work, school, hobbies or whatever that end up leaving no time for anything else like a relationship.
What is your story of girls being perverts?	I went out on a date on Sunday. We both play Pokemon Go, and they were having a community day. We were out catching pokemon when she caught a CP 69 Mudkip and immediately showed me and started laughing. Wasn't uncomfortable at all, though admittedly not very deep in the pervert realm.	Girls in middle school used to randomly pull up my shirt, I guess to see my little 12 year old abs? Weird. I wore a kilt as part of a costume to football games in high school, and many girls would lift it up to see if I was wearing anything under it. I would never, ever do the same to a girl in a skirt!
Ladies who struggle to get dates/male attention, how do you feel when you're dismissed as "not real" or the exception?	This is so controllable it isn't even funny. As a stripper, I can assure you, EVERY WOMAN can get hit on, you just have to increase your marketability.	It makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate the fact that I'm actually jealous of girls who are street harassed because I know that it is an incredibly violating thing but I can't help but think "what the fuck is wrong with me that it isn't happening to me"
What's it like to regret having a child?	I also don't have kids and never want them. If I were pregnant it would ruin my life. But it would be unfair to place that blame on the child, you know? So those parents may feel the same. Their child ruined their life and their plans and if they could go back, they'd never have kids. But they're still trying to be the best parent they can be.	> if you love your child extremely much, how is it possible to simultaneously regret it? They love their children, they just don't like being parents ( the responsibility, the cost, the loss of their time, and other sacraficies )
What poor life decision(s) do you make?	I exercise regularly, and I eat a lot of fruit and veggies, but I have one or two glasses of beer or wine almost everyday. Expensive, high-quality beer or wine. I occasionally go through spurts where I don't drink at all for three weeks, and I suddenly lose a lot of water weight and save a lot of money, and I think "Why can't I do this all the time?"	I put off important things I need to do until the last possible second due to anxiety. And I don't floss.
Ok lady speaking here... I'm really wanting some perspective on why you decided you wanted children or didn't?	I had a son so I have an heir, keep my surname alive, hopefully he will do well and I can be proud of him. Oh and also when I'm old and feeble I will have someone who will (hopefully) check in on me.	I'm selfish with my free time. Perhaps it comes off as a man child answer but its true. Can't see myself giving that up to have kids. Surely, my decision to not have kids will come back to bite me in the ass later on in life, but that is the consequence I have to live with.
What did you learn about your SO after moving in with them?	Literally nothing new that wasn't a tiny quirk or a small habit. And we (in all practicality) didn't live together until we were married. I simply do not buy the idea that you have to live with someone to know them very well.	Not my current girlfriend, but my previous one. First of all, I'm white and she's black. When she moved in, I realized that she owned a *lot* of romance novels involving black women with white men.
How do you get over an "almost" relationship?	I do not do almost. But for others I would think it best to treat it as a failed date, I suppose. Over it pretty quickly.	Treat it like a break up. I prefer going NC and I try not to dwell on the what-ifs and things I could've done to make things work. It takes me a little while to process and get out of my system, but I like to focus on the positives and what I learned from that "relationship" about myself. I reassure myself that I'll eventually find what I want, and that the end of this relationship is just a step closer to it.
Guys who have had their SO fall out of love with them. What happened? How did she tell you?	I immediately realized I'd picked a coward unable to communicate properly who gave in to the pressure of other people, and anything I'd ever felt for her died. And yeah I'd made mistakes that helped kick it all off going to shit but she sure as hell didn't make talking to her easy. I firmly believe one day, even if it's not until she's old and grey, she'll look back and shed a tear for what could have been. As for me, I've learnt to trust my gut, and won't make the same mistakes again.	I got too fat. Totally reasonable. I *had* gotten too fat. I was always a bit on the heavy side, and she still loved me as I was gaining weight and that's amazing to me, because when I look back on pictures of me... holy hell. Anyway, at a certain point, it was just too much. She tried to play it off as other issues when we were breaking up, but she eventually fessed up. I don't recall even being mad that was the reason. It was just... Yep. I'm fat. I've lost a lot of weight since then and even joined the Army. My life's headed in the right direction and that will never be a problem for me again. Everybody has a right to their preference, and I can't fault her or anyone else in my future for it.
What the hell do you do in the evenings to keep yourself entertained if not drink yourself into a stupor?	Kratom Seriously, if you have a drinking problem or are starting to find yourself just drinking to pass time, kratom is the best thing that can happen to you. It's not really mind-altering, is 1000x healthier and about 20x cheaper. It gets rid of the desire to drink *completely*. ETA: Jesus, downvotes for trying to help remedy a problem?	Typically if I'm at home for the night, I'll just play video games or go for a run. I also may try to get caught up on homework, but that only really is an option if you're in college
Describe why you love her so much?	She's cute, sarcastic (like, savagely) which is a huge turn on for me, smart, interested in my hobbies but has her own, and just genuinely fun to be around. Pity she's with someone else (LDR), possibly moving away, and 8 years younger than me. Fuck. I'll find someone else, but for now she's dominating my thoughts and it's miserable. Yet we keep hanging out.	I'm attracted to her in ways I have never felt before. There's no one single thing I'm attracted to, it's all of her. She's funny but thinks I'm funnier (I'm probably not) She's really intelligent but feels no need to have anyone else know it She does the *right* thing, always choosing to be a better person, every day She has a really nice bum we've been married for almost 20 years.
What‚Äôs your opinion on making euthanasia legal for all adults?	Removed for seeking to promote a personal agenda. If you have any questions, please message the moderator through the link on the sidebar.	Removed for seeking to promote a personal agenda. If you have any questions, please message the moderator through the link on the sidebar.
Guys who left an SO for someone else, what was your experience like and was the grass greener?	The grass was greener we had a great vibe and a positive personality. My past girlfriend I stayed longer than I should have because i was blinded by her beauty and the sex was amazing. She was a squirter need I say more	I absolutely regretted it almost immediately and if I could go back in time I would not have made the same choice. TL;DR: Throughout High School I was massively obsessed with a girl. In college I met a girl who was better for me in every way and we started dating. The first girl got in contact with me and confessed that she's wanted to date me for the past year. I broke up with the second girl for the first. The first girl cheated and then broke up with me.
What tips can you give to a woman who wants to make the first move?	*sigh* just fucking do it the same way you'd expect a guy to approach you. If anything we're much easier to approach than vice versa. Why do women always ask this question so damn much? A lot of guys have had to basically figure this shit out on our own (a lot of the time from watching other guys), why can't you, exactly? Not exactly rocket science	being approached by a woman is absolutely not a turn off. it's a major turn on. we almost never get approached. expect the guy to be a bit in shock/not know what to do because it's likely that this has never happened to him before, but he'll be super psyched about it if he's into you.
What is the hottest thing a woman has ever said to you while sexting?	I personally don't like sexting outside of pictures. The whole painting a scenario thing is just incredibly uninteresting to me unless I can actually do what we're talking about right then. Plus it's usually just meaningless words that never actually happen. My idea of sexting is a girl texting me and saying "Hey, do you want a blowjob tonight?" That would turn me on.	Funny thing is, its usually not during sexting. Usually were having a normal conversation and she will send "I really want to suck your cock tonight". The lack of context makes it seem to matter of fact, like sucking my cock is an item on her grocery list. Its surprising and sexy.
Men who got their first relationship later in life... was it difficult to adjust your lifestyle?	Met my so at 19. She was/is my first. We are at around 5 years. I am still having to adjust shit. But it's worth it because I love her.	Communicate. By that I don't mean "talk for extended hours over the phone and text" but, tell her how you feel. Explain to her how this is all very new for you and how, despite you liking her a lot and enjoy her company, you may still need some time to yourself at times. One of the worst mistakes new couples make is burning too bright for too long too soon.
What is the most cringe-worthy thing a male has said to you?	The guy I was dating earlier this month was into cock worship, and so was I. He sent me a dirty text that was something along the lines of, "Come worship at the temple of my cock." This dude did quite a few cringey things every now and then, but that text took the cake.	I feel like I've posted this before but: "are your pussy lips as big and pink as the ones on your face?"
Men who were falsely accused of something serious, what‚Äôs your story?	This dumbass who my then girlfriend and I were good friends with accused us of stealing his glasses. Its was such an obnoxious accusation that we went along with it and said of course we did and well put them on for sale if you wont show up to hang out with us tonight. He came Through that night and yelled at us until red to give his glasses back to him or hell call the cops. He left pissed and I hope that one day he found them and realized how fucking paranoid he decided to make himself look. That was the last time I saw him irl on facebook I kept seeing him poaching our friends	I can't speak for myself but I have a story of my stepfather. My mom started dating my stepfather when he was fighting a custody battle that went on and off for nearly a decade. A year into getting weekend visitation rights his ex accused him of molesting my stepsisters. We had visitations from CPS, the step girls were given rape kits, psycological evaluations and it even went to court. Even my sister and I were interviewed. I remember him coming home and just weeping and the deepest sobbing I've heard in my moms chest after a court meeting. All the accusations were false. The ex just wanted to keep collecting child support for her, later we found out, heroin addiction.
Men who (appear to) have your shit together, what issues are you currently dealing with?	Serious question (maybe another thread is in order) why are so many of you guys complaining about lack of companionship? Why do you so urgently need one? Some of you even claim to be successful in short term things. Why do you want the long term thing? Why do you think it would improve your life?	Lonely. Very very lonely. The only person I've got to talk to is 3 hours away and I only hear from him like once a month.
Does anyone else have the problem of women not doing anything to try and carry on a conversation?	Most women don't have very good messaging skills, yes. I have better luck when I ask a question and then follow it up with statements.	No, I don't have a problem. They do, with me. If a woman can't hold a conversation, she won't have a conversation with me. That's her problem, not mine.
when did you realize you haven't matured yet?	My daughter made a Christmas wish list and stuck it on the fridge last fall. One of the items was for her to move into the guest bedroom, and since we just painted her bedroom last summer, this irritated me. So I promptly took down the list, drew a stick figure ninja with a flame thrower burning that line with the words "DIE DIE DIE" in a speech bubble above his head, and put it back up on the fridge. I'm 37.	If someone says twist the titty and it ain't a beast they are referring to, your always allowed to laugh. That's not maturity, it's mandatory.
Those of you who dated or had sex with someone of a different race or culture, what is your funniest/weirdest story of culture clash, and what race(s) are you both?	iv been with a first gen Sudanese girl and a first gen Kenyan lady and they were both pretty americanized but they were shocked with what i was packing for only being 5'7 tall.	She was black and I'm not. Rural southern Georgia, 30 years ago. Any time we were in public was an adventure.
What is your "OMG do I really have to explain this to you" story?	I had to explain to my sister how to get stuff from Pokestops. She's 24. I was very confused how she made it past level one without knowing.	How you don't use soap IN your vagina. A pair of dudes argued with me for like 15 to 20 minutes saying I was wrong.

How often have you been surprised by what some girls find attractive?	ITT people believing there is a thing that "girls find attractive". I'm pretty sure there isn't a single person on the planet found attractive by more than 30% of "girls", not even the most popular supermodel.	Many times. Like Rachel? She said no to Batman. And look what happened. Not only did she get blown up by a clown, but the guy that she went for had half his face blown off.
Would you like to receive an engagement watch?	It's not a matter of 'would'. If she's getting an engagement ring, I'm getting an engagement watch from her. There is zero reason why she should be the only one getting a gift to mark the engagement.	Hell yes. I've been advocating this for the longest time. But the practical person in me would prefer to not exchange anything. It doesn't make sense to start a life with someone by shelling out 20k on a wedding and 10k on a ring. That's bullshit. Ha! I'm on my phone and accidentally type "that's bulkshit" at first. It's bullshit and bulkshit!
What‚Äôs the Most Romantic Thing You‚Äôve Done?	I made a wooden ring for a girl in a wooden box that I also made, it was her bday, so I guess it was not romantic, but I think thats the biggest commitment that I have made. I had a crush on her though, it ended up that later on she was not interested in a relationship, because she liked older guys with beards. I know she liked me though, but suddenly pufff, stopped talking, not responding etc.. well her problem she missed out.	I drove ~100 miles to get my college boyfriend his favorite ice cream that was at the time only sold in certain regions, including his hometown. I hid the gallons of ice cream in my dorm freezer and asked him to get me some ice. The look on his face when he realized I had gotten the ice cream was amazing. Only a few years later the ice cream was sold much more widely, including at the grocery store next to my dorm.
In what ways are you kinda creepy?	I regularly tell my SO I'm going to poke holes in condoms so I can trap him forever and since we're long distance it'll mean he HAS to move to me sooner. He knows I'm joking.. or am i?	Sometimes I'll remember a random person from my past, try to find them on facebook, and, if I'm successful, stalk literally everything they've posted. Just idle curiosity, I swear.
What is the most unintentionally offensive thing you've had happen on a first date?	Generally jokes about vegetarians/vegans, or lots of talk about hunting/fishing/farming etc. in a positive way. The jokes are much more offensive, ime.	Guy went on a rant against interracial marriage, I was like "um you know I'm not 100% white, right?" and he backpedaled like "I don't think your parents are bad people, I just think they're mentally ill." edit - wrong your
Men of reddit, what would your girlfriend/fianc√©e/wife do if she found out you look at porn?	She's probably cheating on you if she goes through your shit. I'd leave her ASAP. No good person would ever order their significant other to stop doing something they like doing.	Holy fucking shit. Dude. Red flags. Unless you are wanking 24/7 and ignoring your relationship, porn is not an issue. It is entirely normally. And you have every right to be pissed at the invasion of privacy.
How homoerotic is your humor when it‚Äôs just you and the boys?	I‚Äôm bisexual. My straight guy friends still sometimes do that immature pretending to be gay thing for some reason. It‚Äôs super strange.	I was out with 2 of my friends at a bar and we were just chillin and bullshittin, when one of my friends says, "Can I hold both of your hands while you suck each others dicks?" We laughed hysterically for at least 10 minutes. So, I'd say pretty queerosexual.
What is your grossest lady story?	I am not a lady. However I have lady friends that talk to me about gross lady things to try and gross me out. We had a conversation about tampons. Apparently when women (or at least these ones) poop, the tampon tends to get pushed out and can drop into the poop filled toilet. I've never had a more imaginative picture of poop and blood clots painted for me... well ever. But damn those girls have a silver tongue when it comes to trying to gross me out.	I'll start. I recently got BV (bacterial vaginosis) and chose to use the gel-form of the medication because my doctor said it was faster. From what I understand this gel, inserted nightly basically kills everything up there and sheds some of the vaginal lining. Because what goes up must come down the medication kind of coagulated in my panties in the morning, no biggie, just shower and move on with my day. After my five day run I decided in the shower I should probably pull out my NuvaRing and check on it. Along with the ring came this giant ball of five days old coagulated medication mixed with what I can only assume to be vaginal lining. It was horrifying.... Thank you for listening.
What was that shit storm I witnessed on this sub yesterday?	Honestly, some people are going to enjoy things going to shit and cutting loose, some are not going to. For every person we had complaining about comic sans and the format yesterday, we had two or three sending us modmails and thanking us for loosening up and letting the sub get crazy. We're not going to make everyone happy, and its pointless to try. If you, or others, think it's dumb... well, it was ~24 hours of your life where Askmen didn't cater to you. And it was ~24 hours where we didn't moderate for content and got to have fun. I think everyone can deal. It's over and done with. And it is entirely predictable because this shit only happens once per year on the same day.	Honestly, some people are going to enjoy things going to shit and cutting loose, some are not going to.

(Possibly NSFW) Who is the creepiest girl you know? What makes her creepy?	I had a friend who was very envious of my life. I was an overachiever, won many awards, I was likable, had many friends, had style, and tall and pretty. She was unfortunately the butt of everyone's joke, resembled shrek (I wish I was kidding...) and overall an obnoxious and loud person. We had similar interests so we remained friends. She went behind my back and told my boyfriend she was in love with him, she cried and admitted to cutting the word "fat" into her skin when I happened to change in front of her during a trip. It sucks she had such low-self esteem but she made me feel very uncomfortable in many situations. For that, she is the creepiest girl I know.	In highschool j had a neighbor girl that would come to my window and watch my friend and I watch tv. We'd see her reflection on the TV and stop talking.... she'd just stand there.
What's your win of the week?	Discovered a new nsfw subreddit. Ninja edit: meh, didn't realise I was posting in AW. Fuck it, the sub is awesome.	I successfully merged work friends with non-work friends for a trivia team. We didn't win the big prize but we did great and everyone got along.
Girls in the US have been getting higher grades than boys at school and university for nearly a century Why Do you think that is?	Women are planners. As a majority we plan for our future where as most men do not look that forward. I planned my whole school life starting in 5th grade. My brother, only 3 years younger, hasn‚Äôt planned his school at all and now as a senior has been through 4 different high school being kicked out of 3 in the past 2 years.	My experience as a former educator and childcare worker: girls are more likely than boys to believe they need school to move forward/get ahead. Most of my work was with lower income and middle class students. The boys usually told me they planned to work with their dads/in their dad's industry, or go into the military, or go into sports. Often they do need school for these things long term, but they don't see that early on. Girls were more likely to have a career goal for which they felt they needed a degree and therefore needed good grades. Military and sports careers are sold to girls less often, and you still have less of a tradition in families of welcoming daughters to the "family business".
I am misogynistic but i don't want to be. How do i change my subconscious views on women?	First things first: forgive your mom and forgive yourself. If any part of you relates your mom to *all women* then any progress you make will only be backtracked at some point. What your mom did give you is clear warning markers on the kinds of behavior that you want to avoid in *anyone*, not just women.	"...my single mother who was very abusive towards me." You've got to repair that damage with a therapist as soon as possible. What you're experiencing now is only one symptom.

Dudes with long hair, how did you survive the awkward in-between stages?	if you have long straight hair, pony tail works, not that man bun shit. I myself have long, curly hair and it just does it's own thing and I stopped giving a shit about looking like a retard awhile ago. When I'm working outside I usually just wear a hat to keep it out of my eyes. Sorry about your dad OP. If someone gives you shit about your hair looking stupid just say "yeah well i'm growing it out so i can donate it to cancer patients for wigs" and they will shut up.	Well, I was fifteen years old and played World of Warcraft at the time, so I was oblivious of the real world for the worst of it.
What is something your SO does or wears that instantly turns you off?	My ex used to do frequent waxing on her legs and pubic region. It was absolutely disgusting. The hair never grew back correctly, it was always sparse and had a weird texture. Waxing is now a dealbreaker for me. Also too much makeup is gross. It doesn't smell good, it looks slimy, it catches sweat and has a weird texture.	She talks in this fucking fake anime voice whenever we're not in public. She does it constantly at home and it's ok for a while but it starts to really aggregate me. I get it's all "cute" and whatever but after a long day at work i want to unwind without having a conversation in high pitched sailor moon squeals
What fashion trend do you hate and wish would die out?	So just because you don't have a "romper body" you think they should go out of style for everyone else too? That's pretty irrational.	Painted-on eyebrows. Got thick eyebrows? Great, rock 'em. Want to fill yours in a bit? Looks awesome. Painting them on so you can't even tell there's hair... looks a bit too cartoonish for me.
Men of Reddit: How often do you find yourself turning down your girlfriend/wife for sex?	Never done it. I'm always the rejectee, not the rejector. Now that you've experienced it, hopefully you'll have more empathy next time you reject him. It always feels better when her excuse is reasonable, she promises it will happen soon, and keeps that promise.	Pretty much only if I haven't slept for like 3 days or if I have a stomach ache or something. Don't feel down. Guys aren't as desperately sex craved as the world would have you think.
Why do you think that "there are no girls on the internet" is a thing?	Due to the subject matter, this thread will be watched closely. Read the rules before posting, and don't be an ass. Edit: Alright. Too many people don't know how to read the rules. Enough has been said and we're just seeing variations on the same rule-breaking themes. This post has been locked.

Ladies, do any of you suffer from Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder, for lack of a better term? Does sunny weather depress you?	I wouldn't say I get depressed, but the summer is extremely hard on me. My lupus is worsened by sunlight and heat so I tend to spend the summer indoors more. I also go through a lot more flare ups during the summer, and most of my hospitalizations happen in the summer months. I would much prefer it stay fall/winter all year.	Thought you might appreciate [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnjZNJyDc7NZiZG/giphy.gif) :) I am just like you. Sunny weather gets me angry, depressed and I feel super worthless. Yesterday was the perfect day in my city: cold, dark and rainy all day. It felt amazing. Today the sun is out and it's so hot. I am definitely looking forward to autumn and winter.
What is the most accidentally insulting thing you've ever said to a woman?	I had a roommate once, we had been friends in high school, and years later became room ates... her sister and i lost our virginity to each other back then. One night we were drinking and somehow we got to compliment roommates boobs. My dumbass said "well if your sister had had your boobs, that woulda made our first time perfect" She was so mad after that we didnt drink together again after that... told her sister to stay away from me after that for life lol. i really didnt see the big deal,, still dont.	When I was in high school, I once thought "love handles" was the sexy waist part of an hourglass figure. smdh That didn't end well...
Ladies, how do you know your SO is also truly your best friend?	Honestly, he's not. And we're both okay with it. Is he my best friend? Yeah. But, he's not **the** best friend. That honor goes to someone else	I‚Äôm extremely introverted, but I can spend 24 hours a day with him and never feel drained. Spending time with him actually recharges me. He‚Äôs my safe place.
Ladies, have you ever been with a man where you've actually been attracted to his natural scent?	I always wondered this. When I played football I remember coming out of practice with only my morning deodorant, its now 9:30 at night. I had girls just going crazy over my sweat drenched body. I had a wet t-shirt and wet hair all from burning hot summer days and eighter my gf or others would flip to dirty sex machines. Now I felt bad for being so dirty but they said I smelled amazing. Could it be pheromones?	I love my husbands natural scent. Its soothing, in a way. Cuddling up to him is home for me, its warm and inviting. I like to lay by his armpit and fall asleep there because I feel so calm. Ok, that was weird to type.
Ladies, what action or issue in a relationship is pretty much an instant dealbreaker for you? Any particularly unusual ones?	if he lies, i should have walked away then because that was the only truth he ever told me. That he lies even when he has no need. So whenever we had a serious convo i would always ask if he's lying. I felt like he never did lie, until they all unraveled. Silly me thinking I would be the only person he wouldn't lie to..	A guy who harms an animal on purpose. That's not unusual though. I can deal with a lot of common things, weird likes and dislikes. I may joke about some things like, "If you like that band, we're done!" but I never mean it.
We always talk about crazy exes...but when and why have you been the shitty ex-girlfriend?	Not me but my fianc√©s ex. She cheated on him, they broke up, then she went on to throw paint on his car. Like I thought the ppl who are cheated on did the paint throwing.	I've always been bad with texting after breakups. I'll just text whatever angry thought pops into my head. Multiple paragraph long texts. For weeks. I'm always embarrassed as hell after everything blows over.
My 14 year old brother is really perverted and inappropriate. Any advice on how I can let him know certain things are not okay to say?	Sounds like he was sexually abused. Hyper-sexuality in a child that age can be a sign of a much bigger problem. I would get him to a professional for help even if this isn't the case. This isn't normal 14 year old boy behavior, and he isn't going to grow out of it. Get him help.	Tell him that last sentence straight up. He's 14, he's not a little kid anymore. "Look, you keep talking about stupid shit like that I'm going to treat you like people do when you won't shut up about it. Hint: THEY DON'T HANG AROUND YOU." Also, tell your folks he's being inappropriate. They might have better chances straightening him out as they're already authority figures. Alternative: Start telling him about gross stuff to get the point across. "UGH. My flow was SO heavy this month it was like that one scene from The Shining with the elevator."
When walking alone behind a woman (especially at night) do any of you adjust your speed so that she doesn't think you are a rapist?	I keep my speed and don't give a shit about her. If she is not happy she can go to tumblr post about how much oppressed she is.	I'll talk to myself loudly so she knows that I'm conversational and not intent on causing her any duress. Then, occasionally, I'll unleash a spine-chilling shriek into the night to ward of any ne'er-do-wells that might be nearby. If the talking to myself and screaming doesn't make her feel safe, I'll begin laughing maniacally so she knows I'm a man of good humor and not a raving lunatic.
Does anyone here have an ever expanding library of nicknames for their pets?	Deffinetly! Lets see theres: Pooee, we call her poo poo, poo bear, poo bum, shitty bum. Lucy-Fur, we call her lucy, satan. Yuki, we call him yuki-san, little man. And Moggy, we call him moggy-san, moggachino, moggatude.	My cats both have very grand-sounding names. (One vet, upon meeting them, exclaimed, "jeez, are you guys English majors or something?" I'm dating a literature grad.) Beyond bastardizations of their actual names, my tortie goes by fluffbutt, fluffles, tortles, snickerdoodle, pudgekins, fatty, princess, hungry hungry hippo, and homicidal maniac. The ginger goes by fuzzbutt, bricky, doofles (he's very muscular and none too smart), little ginger, ginger muffin, munchkin, and unholy terror. I spend a lot of time lovingly insulting their size (too small), intellect, and appetite. I saved these guys from high-kill shelters, put up with their shit, and spoil them for all I'm worth. I'm going to extract all the mileage I can from the fact that they don't know English.
How old are you and what is the biggest struggle in your life right now?	28 (29 in a month) here. Right now, it's that my husband and I have been not-trying (ie: not actively preventing) to get pregnant for two years now with no luck and it's really starting to wear on me. His younger sister just announced that she's having a baby in April. I'm happy for her but it also reminds me of how much I want it and how scared I am that I can't...	I am 61. I quit working several years ago to take care of my MIL until she died. Then took care of my own mother until she died. Now am stay at home housewife trying to find purpose and relevance for the next stage of my life. I have all the time in the world and no idea what to do with any of it. Not true- I have hobbies and things I enjoy doing. I'm just at a bit of a crossroads right now and having difficulty adjusting to not being needed as much any more. Husband is wonderful but I am alone a lot. First world problem to be sure.
Does Rogaine really work?	No. Science is still several years from curing baldness. Own it and shave your head, and save hundreds of dollars in the process.	If anyone considering Rogaine has cats (since this is reddit), they should be aware that minoxidil is extremely toxic to felines even externally without ingestion. So keep it away from your cats and rinse your shower out carefully.
Did anyone have kids for the purpose of making their parents happy? If so, how do you feel about your decision?	I don't know if this totally fits but I just turned 31 and I'm 10 weeks pregnant. While I'm a professional my job doesn't pay very well and the father, a computer programmer, has been out of work for more time than I care to think about and already had 3 kids and issues with child support because of the laps in work. If it weren't for the support of my family who REALLY wants a grandchild and the support of my friends I'd be way more stressed out. It's not that I don't want kids but despite my age, on my own, I don't feel like I'm in a good place financially for this kid plus, on paper, the father doesn't sound very good, but my parents are more than ready to help me out so I'm gonna make it work.	I knew along time ago that I never wanted to have children. Now at 40, I know it was and still is the best decision for me. A few years ago I sat down with my Dad and explained my decision and what led me to make that choice and I told him he's an amazing father and grandfather. (He is a grandfather, he has 7 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren from my siblings.) he just wouldn't be getting one from me. He kissed me on the forehead and said, "You do what's right for you. I am surrounded by plenty of love already and I don't want you doing something so life changing just for me." I have a good Dad.
What interest/hobby do you enjoy that you don't tell people about? Why do you keep it secret or choose not to talk about it much?	Another on for me is feminism. I don't like being randomly attacked by rabid MRAs for "hating men" when I've probably done more for men's rights than most of them. I don't enjoy guys suddenly "devils advocating" on dating sites or Facebook or whatever because being a feminist means "come question me with ridiculous straw man situations because I believe in equality". So yeah, I just tend to not mention it unless I know someone has a reasonable view of feminism (is a feminist or at least has a somewhat nuanced understanding of feminism but disagrees with parts of it, or even knows nothing about feminism but is curious about it).	I like sitting and colouring. I don't tell many people because a lot assume it's really childish and that I'm weird, but I find it really soothing and it helps me when I'm stressed.
Men of reddit, what made you fall out of love from your SO?	I've been on the wrong end of the breakup the past couple of relationships, and it definitely made me fall out of love. And the one before that, I was never really into the girl, more "she's nuts about me so I'll fuck her on the reg and see if I catch feels." (Narrator: "He didn't catch feels.") Last time I was in love and fell out of love, it was because her social-justice-warrior politics and tendency to shit-talk my friends made me realize it would eventually be them or her, and they were here first (also "bros before hos.")	Realizing that she had zero intentions of being in an equal partnership - when she needed support I was there for her, whatever she needed. When I needed support she shamed me for it, called me childish, said I was trying to get her to mother me.
Men who are dating to or married to extremely hot women, what problems do you have to face?	I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance. So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness.	My lady is pretty hot and Im very trusting, but the truth is I get over protective the moment she feels uncomfortable. She has this certain fake smile and awkward laugh and its like my bat ~~symbol~~ signal. Edit: signal
In what ways do you or your SO break gender norms?	I can't cook for shit, he loves it and will spend ages reading the recipe magazines my mom buys him. When we set up the wedding registry there wasn't anything in particular I was too excited about but even now he gets all excited about the Le Creuset stuff we got.	I'm single, but I have an Uncle who was a stay at home dad, and my Aunt was the "breadwinner". But my Uncle went back to work once the kids were more grown up. But I would say thats quite the reversal of "gender norms".
Does being called "Ma'am" make you feel old?	Yes. I think it's only happened once for fast food but yuck I don't like it I'm turning 23 I don't expect to hear that until I'm 30 or older!	I grew up in Texas. Around here, calling someone ma'am is the polite way of addressing any female you don't know. I personally find it a little off putting when people react unpleasantly to it - it's like holding the door for someone and having them yell at you.
What book are you currently reading and what do you think of it so far?	I'm in the midst of 4 books: &#x200B; 1. The Doomsday Book, by Connie Willis. She tends to plod along, but her ideas stick with me for years. Same with this one. 2. Guns, Germs, and Steel, by Jared Diamond. Mainly because I keep seeing it referenced on reddit. I'm only on chapter 1, so I have no opinion yet. 3. Here and Now and Then, by Mike Chen. I rather like it. I'm about 40% through. 4. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, by Shoshana Zuboff. My partner and I are reading it together (he chose the book). I'm about to rage-quit the internet because of this book. This gives me some extreme anxiety.	Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn. I watched the HBO miniseries before the book. So far I like the book better.
Men in committed relationships: how often do you get crushes on other people? How do you react?	If you're getting crushes easily, it probably means something is off, could be your partner, the type of relationship or you just aren't ready for commitment. When I'm in love I hardly even notice other girls as potential partners.	There are times when things are particular rough in my current relationship where I'll get flirted with and I'm thinking about the grass being greener. But I know I wouldn't want her to do the same to me, so I go back home and water my own yard. There's no sense in complicating a relationship by pursuing other people.
How often do you feel ugly/unattractive?	How does it feel knowing I was lucky generically to be born as one of the few 5% attractive guys in the world who can get any attractive woman? Literally nothing you can do school, work, career, etc will help you get laid more than me simply because I was lucky to hit the genetic lottery? Every time you see a gorgeous girl and desperately think to yourself "I wish she'd give me a chance" I want you to remember that assholes like me fuck her without even earning it or even trying. So enjoy your internet upvotes and DnD but in the real world where it matters you ain't shit. Hey but at least you got upvotes right? The bitches loves guys who get upvotes lol loser.	Every time I look at a picture of myself. It's like, *that's* what I look like?! Ew. I'm decent-looking when I look in the mirror, and people say I'm decent-looking in real life, but I always think pictures of me look terrible.
Men of reddit, have you ever had a girl look at your dick while talking to you?	Yes. It just makes me think to myself, "you women are ducking hypocrites. I wonder if she wants to bang?"	I assume it's involuntary. I'd hate to be called out for all the times I was staring off into the abyss and the abyss just happened to be the tits of the woman I was talking to at the time.
Have you ever been involved with someone who was way out of your league?	I almost was. Then she flaked twice on dates and proceeded to make fun of me about asking her on a date. She was an incredibly smart and gorgeous woman however. Way out of my league. At least now I know my place.	I had thought so. I dated her for a few weeks and she was amazing--couldn't get enough of me, was a freak in bed, wanted to start introducing me to her friends, etc. Then something changed, she got cold and bailed. I was totally smitten with her for those few weeks. She was super hot, funny, seemingly really sweet, but was pretty mean and awful after leading me on fairly hard. Point is, people aren't always what they seem. "Your league" is a stupid gauge, and should only be measured by people who are worth your time. Many of those people will most likely be hot, and you'll be fine.
What was the turning point that led you to decide for or against having children?	People should only have children if they want them more than anything else. Women who want kids describe it as a relentless imperative and they will climb mountains to conceive. What I hear from you is ambivalence, which is fine, but means "no" in this scenario. Also, your husband wanting two kids who will play together sounds a bit like he's expecting that having two will reduce the amount of time you need to spend watching/entertaining them--which it doesn't. I never wanted kids and my ex said he was ok with that but he changed his mind. He later remarried a teacher who doesn't want kids because she's around them all day. if being around kids is enough, then it should stay that way. If you need a child more than anything, go for it.	It's a little morbid, but I realized that I wanted children right after my mother died. Up until then, it was more of a 'eh, if I get pregnant then it isn't the end of the world, but no big deal if I don't' However, about a month after she died (she was 52 and I was 27) I realized that I really wanted children. I've talked to some other people and they told me the same thing, realizing the strong desire for children after the death of someone close.
Those of you who have struggled with addiction, what were the early signs? How are you doing now?	I have an addictive personality disorder, so I get addicted to various things constantly, usually to replace the current addiction with something else. Generally they're short term. I've known since I was a teenager that I had predispositions to addiction, so I deliberately stayed away from most things that I knew would be the most destructive. When I do indulge, I've gone through periods of time where I have consciously had to take a break before I go too far down the rabbit hole, and that started when I was about 21 mainly due to access. Because I've known about it for a long time, and know when I want something to enjoy it versus wanting it for the sake of satisfying the construct if desire, I'm pretty good at finding the tipping point before I hit it, thankfully.	Not sure if it counts but I was heavily addicted to cutting for 5 years, I'm 2 years clean now. Early warning signs were I guess my worsening depression when I was younger and my inability to cope well with anything. I was so sad all the time and I felt like I'd finally found a way to express my sadness on my body. But before I knew it, it was a relief for even stress. I would have dozens of cuts up/down both sides of my forearms and would just always wear sleeves, even in 110 degree Southern California summer heat. I'm doing a lot better now. The urges have mostly gone, i never really think about cutting to help me cope with anything anymore.
Am I the only woman who is totally finished at 1 orgasm? Anyone else like this?	this is why there can be no conversation on sex. you can't say shit without someone feeling inadequate. irl it's like women don't have orgasms at all. women who feel annoyed by that so they speak up on the internet. that's all it is	Me. Me. Me. It always blows my mind when women talk about having 5,6,7,15 orgasms. Like wtf is your vagina made of??? It takes considerable effort for me to cum even once. I'm a one and done person, orgasms are intense and I get super tired and kind of lose interest in anything sexual after I cum....maybe I'm part man.
What's the most cringe inducing thing you've done after a breakup?	My EX broke up with me the day before Valentines Day, I made him meet up with me the next day so I could still give him the gift I had gotten for him (a commissioned illustration of us) and it was just terribly awkward and he even gave me a pity gift (he had clearly already decided he was gunna dump me, so he grabbed some old, ugly, musty scarf his cousin had knit once upon a time and gave it to me as his "gift"). It was just embarrassing for both of us. I should have just burned everything and went on with my life but I was desperate for a second chance. Thankfully I got over him fairly quick after that.	I freaking called his mom asking what I did wrong and if she could convince him to get back together with me... Oh God why did I do that.
Who is THAT person on Facebook whose posts annoys you?	My racist ass relatives on my mom's side who are Asian but act/think they're white, and pretend to identify with mainstream white conservative values...whenever a cop shoots an unarmed person of color, they always take the cops' side, among other gross things etc And I'm sitting here like...you're Asian, white people don't like you much, stop selling out to them, etc	Ugh for me the worst is people pushing their LuLaRoe/Jamberry/Thrive/whatever MLM flavor of the month. Edit: I lied. Worst is the girl who live blogged via FB her entire divorce and subsequent singlehood. I ended up defriending her because I couldn't watch the downward spiral anymore. Literally it was all #sadpoetry #datingmyself #missmybestfriend HASHTAGS DONT EVEN WORK LIKE THAT.
How do you cope with being unattractive?	"Unattractive" on whose scale, the billion dollar 'beauty' industry? My god, the amount of time and money women could save if we could just reject these artificial standards. Be kind to yourself and equally important be kind to others. How radical would it be if we all just stopped commenting on each others looks?	There are good days and bad days. Sometimes, I can just let go and have fun... but the moment someone posts pictures of all the fun we had, those memories turn sour. I try to deal with that by not taking pictures or avoiding any cameras that come out. I also try to maintain myself in other ways, like my fitness level, since I can't really change my face. Therapy helped a lot, but I still struggle a lot with body issues and eating disorders.
Who and/or what are you currently boycotting, and why?	Corporation wise, I boycott any company I find out condones any sort of bigotry against minorities or donates to right wing causes. Personally I do not associate with anybody who holds right wing views or supports right wing politicians. At this point I believe anybody who still calls themself a conservative is evil.	KVD. I honestly didn't know how gross of a person she was. I'm one of those people that don't pay too much attention to people's personal lives but after learning about all of the racist shit, on top of the anti-vaccine stuff, I just can't support her at all. I was so excited for her vegan stuff but nah.

What has been the most romantic frugal date you have been on?	The only romantic date I've been on was to brunch In a Colombian cafe and then a tour of the chocolate factory next door. I wish I was attracted to him, or that I just dated him even though I wasn't.	I like to read, so he took me to the park and we got some drinks and I laid my head in his lap while he played with my hair and read to me from the book I was in the middle of. Probably the best date I've ever been on, honestly.
We have a sticky thread discussing masculinity as well as its toxic variations. What do you think are examples of toxic femininity and what can women and men do to reduce instances of it?	No such thing as toxic masculinity or toxic femininity. Its called being an asshole. Ive met guys who were huge tools and were dicks and ive met girls who were huge cunts. Its a PEOPLE problem not gender.	The petty and passive aggressive atmosphere at some work places with women is pretty damn toxic. Something about the way woman are socialized to act around "competition" mixed with forced professionalism causes it I think.
Ladies, who is a celebrity that men goes nuts for and you just *do not* see it?	Honestly, all these goddamn white ladies. I get so bored seeing the same bland, white faces in movie after movie. Same goes for men.	Jennifer Lawrence. I don't think she's hideous or anything, but I think if she wasn't famous and guys saw her walking around the mall, nobody would look twice at her. I think Charlie Day is incredibly hot.
What do you think of the death of US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg?	Eh, I really didn‚Äôt like her due to her racism(yes liberals can be racist).But I don‚Äôt want Trump to fill another seat. Edit- Downvoted for pointing out someone‚Äôs racism, interesting.	I think ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucked‚Äù and the hypocrisy of Mitch McConnell is about to come out in a loud attempt of further controlling the USSC.
Female here. What's the best way to offer to pay on the first date?	I'd say just be able to cover some of the bill it the guy comes up short on cash. Most of us (me included) are too proud to let our S/O pay for their meal because we feel like we have failed to provide. Obviously we don't want you to run up a $200 bill so a guy may ask you to pay your end if the deal. But If you really want to pay the bill just ask before you order your food so He will have a heads up.	Alright so reading your message of a story I'm not going to say anything based off of people's personality bc I honestly have no idea what happened. However if you offer to pay, consider that you have done your part in being a self sufficient adult because you COULD pay for yourself and you have offered to do so. If your offer is declined, say thank you and indulge in the other's kindness. Sure it feels nice to help pay the bill but keep in mind it also makes your date feel nice when they are able to pay for you.
Have you ever been gaslighted, or suspected someone of trying to gaslight you? What happened, and what did you do about it?	This is only slightly related, but my mom often suspects me of gaslighting her (not using this specific term, though). I don't have a reputation for being deceitful, but as a former rebellious teenage girl I've told my share of lies to her. often, when she remembers something incorrectly and i dispute it, she will accuse me of trying to trick her. in reality, she's starting to get old and some of the finer parts of her memory are fading.	My dad is a classic emotional abuser. His favorite thing is to move or hide other people's possessions, mail, etc and insists that they never were there. Second favorite is to scream insults then act confused and hurt when you react in kind. I've taken to gaslighting him back by saying how concerning it is how he keeps forgetting things and maybe he should be tested for dementia.
What do you think about a 16-year-old guy dating a 23-year-old woman?	> What do you think about a 16-year-old guy dating a 23-year-old woman? First thought: "Niice, this dude is upgrading to mature women!" If the age of consent of the area the person is 16: legally, go ahead. This applies to girls as well.	I won't lie, it's pretty fucking strange for a girl that age to be with a teenager. I would feel pretty damn great if I were him, but it's still weird.
What's the appropriate amount of time to wait before eating someone on a desert island?	I think 3-5 hours is appropriate. You don't want to be too hungry to overpower someone, but you don't want to be THAT guy and start eating before everyone else. Of course, you'd want to ask anyone else if they're hungry before you start knocking people over the head with coconuts, just to be polite.	The last few hours before you die of starvation, because at that point your only other outcome is probably death. I would implore you to try and not eat anyone on the island and instead make smoke signals or giant help signs on the island with your fellow strandees to catch the attention of the inevitable rescue crew. And then when everyone else agrees and nods to my suggestion I go in for the kill.
You have 30 points to allocate across 6 categories to build potential partner (max is 10 for each): looks, empathy, mental health, ambition, intelligence, charm. How do you allocate them?	That's not how it works, thankfully. How sad it would be if being good in one dimension automatically meant you couldn't be good in another.	You people are all thinking small, always min-max when creating characters. I'd max out ambition, intelligence, and charm, give myself a serious supervillain. Spouses of supervillains usually end up on nice private islands when the world ends.
How do you react to other women putting you down?	Remember that hurtful people are usually hurting a lot on the inside too. It doesn't excuse behaviour, but being nice in return can ameliorate the situation a lot more quickly and cleanly.	Also, a feigned look of pity and a gentle "I would be so embarrassed if I spoke to people the way you do." Bonus points if there are others around to hear it, as they'll always agree with you.
Who was your worst manager and why were they so terrible to work for?	My worst manager was a woman. She spent her life making mine hell. She took an instant dislike to me. I was very young at the time, maybe 18/19? I remember she tried to keep the entire store of us for overtime on Xmas Eve with no warning, telling us we wouldn't leave till all the markdowns were complete and the store was fully ready. My sister called bullshit, came in screaming at her for me since she was meant to be meeting me from work, ended up quitting the job new year!	When I was working at an ice cream place for a few months. He was in his early/mid-20s, and I was 16. He hit on me all the time, made really inappropriate comments, and was just a gross dude. I would turn him down, and he would only schedule me for shifts he worked...the owner wouldn't ever do anything. But I was 16 and didn't have a good homelife and quitting meant spending more time at home, so I didn't consider it. Then once I was in the back with him helping him restock some dry goods (we were closed) and I turned him down again and he raped me. I went to the owner the next day and was fired. I can't imagine working in a situation that bad again.
I often see the "we're raised to avoid conflict/be nice" message often when women respond to questions that center around why they aren't often direction with their intentions. How do I avoid this when raising my daughter?	I think one of the the best way for her to learn about confrontation would be to see it modeled in the home. As in, if other members of the family engaged in healthy, assertive communication in front of her. Then she will feel safe doing the same at home and eventually anywhere. Growing up, I never had a good model of assertiveness and was conditioned to not have a voice. As a result, I'm usually drawn towards very outspoken, assertive people and thankfully they helped me learn to have a voice. Sounds like you are doing a good job so far and it makes me happy to see a dad so caring and involved.	I'm not female, but I can recommend Tamora Pierce for kids' books with healthy feminism. The Lioness quartet that starts with Alanna: the First Adventure features a great story that has a lot to say about gender roles.
Have you seen the "modesty and miners" post on Facebook recently? What are your thoughts on it?	I think we have to be *soooo* careful how we teach and frame the modesty issue when talking to young girls (boys too). If we're not careful, it can be very harmful to their self-esteem. Stuff like this makes me cringe so hard. And I'm all about modesty! But it's by nature a very sensitive issue, and needs to needs to be treated with a great deal of care.	Those ladies need to contact HR for sexual harassment. To avoid a lawsuit, the chairman should have just said, "Professional dress code applies here. Please change your outfit to something more fitting a business meeting." Also, you know what I love about this tract? I love the way it suggests that diamonds, gold, and pearls were given value "by God" rather than by men and women who like pretty sparkly things.

How often do you receive oral?	As a guy who's absolutely terrifying of even trying this, can I ask other guys what's the appeal of this?	I've been with my husband almost 4 years and he has literally never done it. I love it, but it's just something I have to deal with.
Men of Reddit, what do you want to get off your chests or talk about, but feel like you can‚Äôt in person?	I think just raw intelligence is only tangentially related to objectivity. The reality is people belive what's comfortable for them. Sometimes that shows you their real priorities in ways you might not like. A smart enough person can rationalize most things. This means all that really stops your freinds and family from hating and leaving you is a persuasive enough argument with enough supporters that puts you at odds.	Shit, dude, I want a hug. Not from a family member. I just really want to hug a friend, or someone whom I like. I yearn to just have sone sort of physical contact with others. I don't know how common this is, but I don't think I'm the only one.
What celebrity death affected you the most?	I can't see how any fan who doesn't actually know the person in question is actually affected, apart from just being a bit sad about it when they read the headline. They certainly aren't affected like that person's friends and family whose lives actually change. That said, I still feel sad when I think of Steve Irwin. I was a bit upset as a kid when I heard he was killed, although I couldn't say I was surprised (I was only surprised by what did him in as I would have expected a crocodile or a snake.) Mostly I just feel sad when I think about what he would be doing now. I imagine he would still be involved in conservation, probably even still on TV.	David Bowie. I was a huge fan, he was one of my style icons, I just sorta took it for granted that he was part of this world and always would be. Knew he had a new album, then one morning I woke up and in my half-asleep state heard his name on the news, thought 'is he going to be on? I didn't think he was the morning news show type' but then I realized they were saying REMEMBERING and no, oh no.
Today is National Ice Cream Day! What's your favorite kind of ice cream, and what do you like to eat it with, if anything?	Not actually that fond of ice cream. I like it and all but I would choose almost any kind of sweets over it	Moose tracks. The vanilla ice cream with swirls of wonderful chocolate fudge + mini peanut butter cups is divine. It doesn't need anything else.
What moment made you look at your SO and think, "Wow, they must really love me"?	So i‚Äôm a pretty picky eater and extremely emotional. I also hate veggies, so one time we went to taco bell and i asked for no lettuce on my tacos. we get home and of course there is lettuce on my tacos. I completely lose it and start crying. I feel like kinda a big baby for crying over lettuce being on my taco, but my wonderful SO who puts up with all of my cry baby moments, told me it would be okay. He picked off every piece of lettuce on my taco and returned it to me. I felt so grateful to have him and in that moment thinking, who else would have done with for me? I ate the taco even though it had a lettuce taste to it.	I'm allergic to cats. I found out he gives his a bath every time I'm going to his place so there's less dander and I dont have such a bad reaction. I hear bathing a cat is not for the faint of heart.
What's your favorite food/drink to eat during a movie/Netflix binge session?	I will have a glass or two of red wine or if I have a snack, plain popcorn as I can have a decent amount and only eat 100 calories :) Overall I just avoid snacking in front of TV these days though.	Disgustingly cheap chain restaurant pizza. Crazy bread is choice, but lately I've had to settle for Dominoes because there is no little caesars nearby.
What is a technology that you initially scoffed at, but by now have fully integrated into your life, or generally accepted very positively?	I cannot think of any, really. I've always been super-into technology - got a cellphone first among my peers, have 7 computers for 4 people in the house, have a Kindle, a Nexus 5, a laptop... I am into technology and embrace most of it! I hope that never wanes and I'm always 'hip' with the newest stuff.	Touchscreen phones. I always loved my Blackberry because of the full keyboard and then I got an iPhone and I even got bored of it because it didn't HAVE a keyboard, so I switched back to a Blackberry. I then caved and have had a touchscreen phone for about 4 years now.
What is something your SO does that makes you feel ‚ÄúManly‚Äù?	My boyfriend is being laid off soon so I'll be the only breadwinner. (By may you meant stereotypical gender roles, right? Cuz I'm a lady.)	When we would both be laying down cuddling, she would have her leg draped over me, her head on my chest, and if I made a sudden movement like get up to use the restroom or get some water she'd pull me back in as if saying not to leave. I'd nudge her a bit and tell her what I was gonna do, and she'd say "ok, but come back to me" all in a sleepy tone! Instant heart melt!
How do you guys feel about someone telling you to watch your language around women?	He comes from a time when men respected women and vice Versa - this generation morals and values have gone out the window any 90% of people. If the kind of music played in today's society was played 80 years back they would be locked up etc. Times have changed and not for the better. It is what it is. You can't blame the old man from coming from his times as much as you can't blame the young guys for being part of this generation. Values, standards, integrity etc has been changed for personal gain, mediocracy and fitting in. It is what it is - How I personally feel? It depends on the woman ;)	I don't watch my language depending on whether or not women are present, I watch my language depending on what social setting I am in. At work? At home? In public? That's really the only thing that matters to me.
Men of Reddit, have you ever been physically abused by a significant other? How did you cope with your emotions afterwards?	She used to smack me around and hit playfully and I mean shed hurt me but I was a guy and had to take it.	I was abused on and off mentally and physically by my ex-wife. She would go nuts and hit me in the face for the most stupid things. I had young children and didn't leave the marriage because of it. I could never understand why she would snap like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She would make me believe that it was my fault when she acted violent. Then finally one day I had enough and I divorced her. I am much happier now and don't live in fear of the crazy woman anymore.
What was the most NSFW you did drunk/high?	Well, there was that time I had sex on a bathroom floor during a party, or the other time I started giving my boyfriend a handjob in the theater while watching rocky horror. Oooh oh my favorite, one night I was drunk at a club with my friends I chugged half a bottle of vodka before even going in. Half way through the night I was making out with some chick trying to convince her to have a 3-way with me and my boyfriend. Unfortunately he didn't see my texts until the next morning...	Have you ever heard of the Whiskey dick? I love whiskey, because many times it has prevented me from having sex I would highly regret.
How do you guys cope with death, and the thought that we‚Äôre all going to die one day?	I've lost all grandparents, and my father. I withdraw. I will never form a friendship again, and I'm out of the dating pool. Everybody leaves. No exceptions. I'm pulling out. I will be professional at work, but interpersonal relationships have halted. I will not risk it. I'm 35.	Interesting that I pop into the sub just now. A good friend of mine, who also happened to be a coworker, died yesterday. Murdered by his ex wife. Shot to death in his home. There's no "coping", I don't think. I think that we usually jsut kinda forget and move on. It most likely won't be on our own terms, so we just kinda go through the motions of life until we don't, and then in the last few seconds, we wonder, "what could have been?" and then a few seconds after that, we probably think "ah, it wasn't that bad all in all" And then that's it. End of film.
What is the best place to take a woman on a first date? Why is it so good?	Female here. She is assessing you on the first day so you need to show your good sides. For that I would say you need to talk, so brunch, lunch or coffee are a good start. But you also need "elevated heart rate" because she is going to associate her feelings about the experience with you. You need an activity that will make her excited/nervous in a good way. So seeing something beautiful, winning/enjoying a game, a dancing, cooking or a woodworking class, a horror movie, rollercoaster, zoo and so on. This second part should be catered to her preferences/personality. In my case my husband took me to a lunch then to a really nice park. I was doing master's then so walking in the park with sunlight, nature sounds and fresh grass seemed like heaven. I still associate him with peace, sun and happiness.	Brunch. Morning first dates are great. You get together for a bit, not too early, not too late. Chitchat over coffee and pastry. If the vibe is good you ask them if they want to: explore this trail/ catch the matinee/ visit this gallery, whatever to extend the date into the day. If there is no click it is really easy to be all "welp, got stuff to do today, thanks for meeting me this morning."
Women who moved to a different country, are you happier ? What made you move ?	I moved to a different country because of a job opportunity. I'm happy, but I'd honestly be happy living anywhere apart from the town I grew up in.	I moved because I had a miserable childhood, and only poor memories of growing up. Best thing I ever did., quite literally. Possibly my smartest decision ever.
To those of you who make over $100k per year and DON'T live in a major city, what do you do?	"Business Intelligence Developer" I don't live in a *major* city, but it's decent sized (~750,000 in the metro area). Median income here is around $55,000. If I sold my house (4BR, 1900, sq ft), I could get about $220,000.	IT Architect, bullshit title, but well over 6 figures in a smaller city where the median income is around 28k
How long is long enough for unwashed clothes to be worn again?	If it's clean, no stains and it doesn't smell terrible you can wear it the next day. Although I rarely wear jeans more than twice in a row.	Jeans aren't suppose to be washed very often. Typically when they start to get baggy or obviously when they smell or get dirty. However, I wash them more often in the summer than in the winter because of sweat, but a third time should be completely fine.
Ladies, do you have stories where a fellow woman helped you out when you needed help?	I was in court for a fix it ticket in burbank with my toddler and did not have the proof showing the taillight had been fixed. The judge asked told me I could pay $20 dollars to the court and one of the court police officers would sign the paper for proof. I had no money on me so as the judge is telling me I had to go downtown to high patrol office where it's free when this kind women handed me $20 and said because I had a small child with me she wanted to make it easier for me.	I was having a mini breakdown a week before midterms during my first semester of university. I was in a rarely used corner of the library having a nasty stress cry. This random older lady pulled up a chair, handed me a pack of tissues, and patted me on the back until I was done. She said she was one of the psychology professors, and she made her rounds through the quiet sections of the school around midterms and finals looking for the students that needed her. She offered a hug, a prayer, a baggie with Hershey kisses and a granola bar, and some advice for general stres relief. I later left due to financial reasons, but I never forgot how awesome she was for doing that.
What tips and tricks did you wish you knew in your early 20s?	Do not put too much effort into pursuing or attempting to build relationships with women. It's an enormous time and energy drain. It's a much better idea to work on improving yourself, if it's in any way connected with work it's also very risk (as is dating) and all in all, it's a much better idea to let women alone.	It took me 5 years to figure out that it doesn't matter if you're right if no one will listen to you. It's just as important to be liked and respected within your group as it is to have good ideas. If nobody wants to work with you or listen to you because of your attitude then you won't accomplish anything. I spent 5 years in the same job before I changed my attitude and started making an effort to engage and make friends with people regardless of their competence or if they appeared to be important. In the next 5 years I was promoted 3 times. I can't help but imagine where i'd be if I wasn't such a punk when I was 25.
How much is normal to ask about your girlfriends ex?	is this normal behaviour? Hey you know what I don't like? When women force me to conform to an arbitrary standard of normalacy in their heads hey is it normal behaviour to not watch tv? To prefer talking on the phone to texting? To ask lots of questions about the universe? Guess what there is no normal fuck your normal to answer your question, why wouldnt the guy want to know about someone else you dated? that way he can avoid his pitfalls and play to his strengths tldr: you are dumb	I think asking a SO how long they dated an ex and why they broke up is valid. Other than that, it can get into insecurity territory and do more harm than good.
Men of Reddit, would you date someone with depression or anxiety? If not, why not? If yes why yes?	NO. Because it's not worth it and it's bad for you. Why would you willingly sign up for relationship that will only make you unhappy I'm the long run... I very much support the idea that if you want to have romantic relationships, love and all that stuff, FIX yourself first! Don't expect other people to fix you. Fix yourself and THEN look for a partner (bf/gf).	I've been there. Dated someone for a year who was clinically depressed and had major anxiety issues. It was very challenging, and honestly it was probably a big part of why we didn't work out (though not the only reason). I think I'd still date someone who had these issues, but I'd need to see that they were adequately treating dealing with them. Left unchecked, these issues are toxic to relationships. But I wouldn't consider them dealbreakers because I know people who have them, deal with them, and are able to function normally.
Guys, how do you fight the impulse to not text your ex months after a rough breakup?	female, (pronounced like tamale) came to r/AskMen from a comment about swamp balls. what helps me is keeping my ex's contact info, but renaming their contact. I'd recommend something simple, like "Don't"	Delete everything. She doesn‚Äôt want to hear from you and the only reason your doing this is because you are at a loose end. Also and I speak from experience if you do contact her and she doesn‚Äôt respond it will make you feel worse. Delete and move to pastures new.
What are your toxic traits?	I make funny jokes and I'm pretty witty with puns n stuff. I argue with myself so I'm pretty amusing after all aren't I?	I don't forget *anything*, and I can't let the past die. I'm actively working on remembering that sometimes the past is the past and to focus on what's in front of me right now.
Do guys really hate to "talk" about feelings?	A lot of people on /r/askmen think that men are pressured into hiding their feelings, because women aren't attracted to weakness. Perhaps that's been their experience, I don't know. In my experience, it isn't difficult to figure out whom you can talk to about your feelings and with whom you should keep it to yourself. And if it's someone you trust, such as an SO, you should be completely open.	Everytime I opened up I got dumped shortly after. I learned fast there is a vast disconnect between what women say they want and what they actually want. The more I posture as an impenetrable alpha male the more success I have with the ladies. I would love to open up. But time and history have shown there is no faster way for her to "lose the spark".
When you get rejected, do you expect/demand an explanation?	What?! No. Why does she owe you a date or an explanation? The only explanation you need is that she's not interested and you don't need her to spell that out for you.	In my experience most rejection explanations have seemed like lazy lies. I'd prefer just a plain ol no. Edit: I also think that when men demand an explanation it comes off like he's really insecure. You can't argue with someone til they get attracted to you.
I don't trust her anymore... how to let her down easy?	You couldn't even be bothered to give your fiance a call to break up with her? Did you really do it over fucking FB messenger? Really?	> Not posting this on /r/relationships[1] because let's face it - /r/relationships[2] is shit, and also I'm banned from there. lol "and also I'm banned from there." it is shit though.
What is something a guy might say jokingly but it really is annoying to you?	When they mumble a vaguely sexual joke so that I can't hear it, and when I ask them what they said, they tell me never mind. Doesn't matter if I'm the only one they're talking to and the joke wasn't made for anyone else's benefit. I despise shit like that. If you're going to insult me or make a joke about me, do it outright. LIKE A MAN.	I'm a twin. Making jokes about including my twin in a threesome, or switching from me to her, are a teleportation device to dumpsville.
My ex's family called me to apologize for his behavior and tell me how much they loved me and were going to miss me. What're your small victories for the week?	Sat down to read the newspaper yesterday morning and saw a douchey former classmate from highschool was arrested for heroin.	The bank gave me back my money in full!! I accidentally transferred it to a previous travel card that was closed, and when it didn't bounce I had to spend hours on the phone tracking it down. 2 weeks later it's back!! I'm not poor anymore!!!
women who lost a lot of weight (more than 40lbs) how did you do it? how long did it take?	Not a woman but weight loss is 90% diet 10% exercise Calculate your TDEE and eat at a 500~ cal deficit every day and overtime you will lose weight in a healthy way There are online calculators and food tracking apps to help you. Myfitnesspal is probably the most popular Also check out /r/loseit and /r/1200isplenty (1200 is not always plenty btw, dont assume calculate yourself)	I went from 185 to 120 in about a year and have kept it all off for the past 15 years. 100% lifestyle change. I educated myself about food, calories, and nutrition and changed my habits accordingly. I also started working out regularly. I also had some cosmetic surgery to take care of loose skin, and now I do amateur female bodybuilding. Right now, I avoid refined carbs and sugars and that has been great for my overall energy levels.
What goes through your head when a woman you find attractive tells you she's a graduate student or has a high level degree (M.D., PhD, etc)?	Men that are worth your time won't give a shit. A decent number will see it as a plus. I doubt that you entered your field based on the opinions of men, why should you care now?	"Oh. Well I guess she won't be interested in me." would be my gut reaction. So many guys would be better for her than me. It's not nice but it's reality in a lot of cases. A lot of studies of relationships show that women are far less likely to "date down" in terms of education level or social class than men.
What do you hate about being a girl?	Please keep in mind the question, and keep your replies on topic please. The question doesn't ask what you hate about being a girl that guys don't have to deal with, or what do you hate about being a guy. Thank you.	Please keep in mind the question, and keep your replies on topic please. The question doesn't ask what you hate about being a girl that guys don't have to deal with, or what do you hate about being a guy. Thank you.
X-post from /r/askmen - What trait did one of your exes have that is now a dealbreaker for future relationships?	"Well the wage gap" If the next words aren't "is made up" Bye bye. Actually any of that sort of feminist rhetoric can go away.	Refusing to hold my hand in public. It wasn't because he didn't like PDA. It was because he didn't want people to know we were together.
What do people consider you weird for?	I am constantly called out for seeming to know too much about too many things. As if I am boasting of being some sort of know it all. Actual fact is - I am a polymath (look it up) with an IQ over 140 and a lifetime of experience doing high level work in about 18 different job/work environments. I had an interest in, followed up by readings in, or experience working at Bridge, skiing, competitive swimming, astrophysics, technology, metallurgy, radio/TV writing, producing presenting acting, automobiles, literature, speculative fiction, BDSM, photography, movie making, farming, eco-home building, antiques, ice hockey, home and furniture restoration, wooden boats, foreign language translation, swords and fencing, sailing and landscape gardening. You know - the usual stuff. And I do not watch TV.	I remember something funny that happened and start laughing in public. My friends always say ''Dude, what is wrong with you?''
Can we actually get age range flair?	I already disregard relationship posts for kids under 25. There are big differences in how people think/work in their 30's and 40's vs. high school/college years. I WOULD like to know people's ages. Just a general category, like 13-15, 15-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-45, 45+	Alright, the mods have discussed this and decided that age flair would do more harm than good. Some people are uncomfortable sharing their age and even having the option would put a spotlight on those who opted out of specifying. We don't want anyone to feel as though they are being pressured to share any information they don't feel comfortable sharing. This is meant to be a place where everyone feels comfortable responding. We also don't want to risk opinions being discounted because of the age of the poster. An older age doesn't automatically equate to better, or more relevant, advice. Likewise, a younger age doesn't always equate to less relevant advice. Having age flair can result in perfectly helpful responses being overlooked. That said, people are more than welcome to share their age in their responses if they feel that it's relevant!
Any other women with no female friends...how are you doing?	Fine. I've never had a female friend. I always get downvoted when I say that, but it's true. No girl or woman has ever tried to befriend me, but to be fair, it's not like I've attempted to befriend them either. I don't know what having a female friendship would even look like. I just picture a lot of extreme awkwardness and anxiety. I don't know how to relax around or relate to other women my age.	I am not good friends with anyone. Unless you count relatives and my SO. I prefer not having friends these days. My attempts at making friends end up them being flaky or using me. Doesn't bother me though. I love my alone time and spending time with my family.
Women who married young and had GOOD results, would you do it differently?	Well, not married technically, but we've been together (basically moved in together for all intents and purposes the week we started dating) when I was 19 and he was 22. Still together 12 years later. The relationship is awesome, though we've had our ups and downs. I think the thing that has kept us together is that we are always kind to one another. What makes the relationship even way 100-times better than it was 12 years ago was that we worked on it and figured out how to grow together and change as individuals, but not grow apart. It's super important if you consider that a full and rich life involves personal growth, but you've decided that you want to be partners on the journey and that journey is a fucking long time. I feel like I didn't articulate that well, though. Sorry.	Married at 23/24, now 39/40. Had kids at 28 and 30, so not too early in that part. We are still stupidly happy. We are still very much in love. We have lots of sex. He's the best partner I could ever ask for. Life is really, really good. My only "regret" is that I never lived on my own -- I went straight from college roommates to living with my now-husband. But financially it was never practical, so oh well.
When one says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have sex all night‚Äù what time do you actually stop and go to bed?	when I can't get hard anymore and she is begging me to stop. so around...1230 or 1 am. happens most friday nights.	Whenever that's happened it's usually devolved into what I called "slex", which is basically sex, you cuddle and fall asleep, then you both wake up and have sex again and the cycle keeps repeating until sunrise.
What is your favorite way your SO shows you they love you, without saying "I love you"?	He asked me whether I wanted a piece of mango out his fruit shaker. I love mango so yes, obviously! I ate it and he said: "that was also the only piece of mango." I went kind of sad, "you should've said so" to which he replied "no, because then you wouldn't have taken it. But I also can't help saying it's the last piece because your reaction is so funny." He loves me. Big time. I mean, he not only gives me food, but even his only piece of something. On top of that, he knows me extremely well and loves to joke around with me. He also bought me a nutella crepe as a surprise once and only took one small bite himself on his way over to me. He's a keeper. <3 I mean... he's a guy and he gives me his food!	Gently cuddling with me and making out with me. My most cherished example is when she came over to my apartment when I was sick and stayed all weekend, taking care of me until I got better; all I did was to reply to a text saying I couldn't go out as I was not feeling well, and she showed up without me asking for help. This happened 7 months into our relationship; neither of my previous two gf's did anything like this in the combined 3.5 years of dating them.
How do you deal with people flirting with your SO?	So Master_Nemo, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you were raised by a woman(like I was, single mom) or are part of the millennial generation. Either way let me make this easy for you, your "Mutual Acquaintance " was directly challenging your manhood and your dominance in your relationship with your SO. Make no mistake about it. Your words "he only did this when he thought I was too far away to hear". This isn't a problem with your woman, it's a problem with you failing to assert your dominance towards the other male. You need to learn when to "have a pair" and stand up for what's yours!	Well I trust my girlfriend to actually shut it down and not go along with it. Talk to her and tell her that it bothers you just like it bothers her when girls flirt with you
Married men with kids: how was sex different (good or bad) after your first baby? Was there any thing that could have made it better?	What sex? After my daughter was born I had two lovers. Ms. Hanna and Ms. Palm. Sex is dead. I‚Äôm dead on the inside too.	My wife didn‚Äôt do any of that, I watched my child be born in vivid detail and it had absolutely zero impact on our sex life. Obviously there was some downtime after the birth, but once we were back in the saddle is was just as often and satisfying as always. Still is 12 years and 3 kids later.
How do you stop from being a "back seat driver" when your girlfriend is horrible at driving?	Put it all on you. She's not a bad driver. You're too nervous and controlling to be a passenger. Or just make it seem like you're offering to drive to be nice and help out.	As a person with a father who drives pretty much the same, I say do one or more of the following: A) Hold on for dear life and keep your teeth gritted. B) Show her (inconspicuously) videos and photos of people who get royally fucked while driving carelessly. C) Sit in the actual back seat. D) Don't give a shit about offending her and drive yourself. After all, is it a bigger deal to piss off your girlfriend, or to get killed because she disregards safety?
What's the preferred way to end a relationship with someone who you've gone on two dates with?	The problem with just sending a text is the technology isn't 100% reliable. And I agree a call puts her on the spot and will be unnecessarily awkward. The best compromise I can think of is a certified letter. That way it's not awkward for either of you and you get a signed receipt confirming she received your written message.	Woman here. Text or call ESPECIALLY if she thinks sex is in the table. It would suck to shave and pluck and put on the matching undies just to get dumped.
Have you ever got to the point where you just didnt want a relationship at a certain point in your life?	Right now. I'm 19 years old. Basically, I'm too mature and girls my age don't want a serious relationship (why the hell?) So yeah, I'm not getting interested in any girls anymore since last year.	As a 51 year old guy, I have to say yes, just recently. My wife died suddenly about 5 years ago and after a couple years, I started dating again. After a while of meeting women that I simply wasn't attracted to, physically or mentally, I'm done. I've become comfortable on my own. I'm not super happy about being single for the next 25-35 years. But the idea of continuing to try and be disappointed, seems worse.
Women with anxiety: what is the most irrational thought/worry you've ever had?	My thoughts aren't irrational. I'm nervous about real things like getting into a car accident, someone breaking into my home, people looking at me etc.	in public, I'm frequently *terrified* that other people can hear my thoughts and that I'm the only one without this ability. I have to try to think only nice thoughts and I think of a compliment for people around, just in case. I have pretty severe OCD, though. I've never mentioned this to anyone. Oddly scary.
What did you expect to change as you became an adult, and it didn't?	I expected to start magically knowing all the answers and what to do when starting to become an adult, just like all the adults around me seemed to do. What I realized was that not only does it not magically happen because you need to work towards it, almost all of the adults I've always known and new ones I come across don't even know if they're doing this whole life thing right. It's all about appearances.	I thought acne would no longer be a thing and I‚Äôd have miraculously clear, beautiful skin for the rest of my life. Nope, gotta religiously use Stridex every other day otherwise all hell breaks loose on my face.
Women , what do enjoy the most about having your own place ?	Not having to deal with shitty roommates. I won't ever live with someone again unless I get married or have a kid.	I love living alone. Everything in my home is something I've chosen, I'm surrounded by things I love. I never have to pick up after someone else. I can always find what I need. When it comes to my home I get to make all the decisions, if I have an ugly recliner in the corner of my living room it's because I want it there. It sounds somewhat selfish, but every other area of my life requires a lot of compromises to work. At home I can do whatever I want.
What will you never tell your S/O?	I prefer to be alone more often then I like spending time with her. She isn't the prettiest girl I have dated.	We didn't accidentally leave the cookie dough out. That cookie dough didn't go bad... I ate it. All of it.
Have you ever had a sudden gut feeling like something isn't right and turns out it was accurate? What happened?	My bff's ex boyfriend. First heard about him and I instinctually thought he was a bad person. When she told me she was scared to break up with him because she thought he'd become violent, I asked her why and he'd been sexually abusing her. Not to mention he hates dogs and supports Donald Trump.	Not too long ago I had to take blood from a patient, I just saw him from behind walking to his room and instantly something in me said "NOPE.". I went to one of the male nurses and asked him to accompany me to the patient's room, he was a little confused but did as I asked. Turns out that patient was just in our part of the hospital for one scan, he is usually in the psychiatric ward and has molested children and had attempted to rape a caretaker about 30 years (?) ago. He is usually only cared for by male nurses or at least while there is someone male present, since he does not seem to respect women as human beings at all.
What is an aspect of women‚Äôs health that you feel high school health classes don‚Äôt get right or don‚Äôt focus on properly?	That having too many partners can cause BV or yeast infections. All that foreign and weird bacteria being introduced into your body can throw off your pH. There‚Äôs a lot of emphasis on the standard STI-prevention but not a lot on the correlation between lots of partners and vaginal infections. Condoms aren‚Äôt the ultimate safeguard against BV or candida either.	How easy it is to get a UTI. I was terrified when I had my first one and I honestly wish someone had told me they were a thing.
Men with little dating experience. How do I treat you?	Tease him like you would a little brother. Squeeze his muscles and make a pouty face. Give him titty twisters. Tell him not to be a pussy. Make him acutely aware of his lack of masculinity, but when he does something masculine you need to reward him by being subservient. If he gets all soft on you again, call him a pussy and refuse to talk about it and just keep moving the subject along. Ask him how much he can squat, how fast he can run a mile, etc and then say that you can do better. It sounds like his wife castrated him and he's forgot what it's like to be a man.	> My heart fucking sank when I read that message. It was just so transparent and... desperate? desperate? nah, he's probably had a number of girls he thought were into him just disappear. he's paranoid, and with good reason. I'd say be clear about your interest and affectionate if that's what you're feeling. if you want to end it, just let him know.
What embarrassing things have you done in front of your SO's parents?	Closest would be me telling their son to work out more to be as fit as his dad. The mother got a little child defensive. It was an ex.	Not his parents, but I was with my boyfriend's aunt and uncle adult cousins and I accidentally cut my hand and bled all over their white pomerianian. It was fairly mortiftying.
what are things women are jealous of in other women that men would never know it's a thing to be jealous of?	I have wavy mermaid hair that looks great when it air dries, nice shaped nails, blonde body hair, great natural brows, nice writing/handwriting, an average 2-4 day period with no cramps since I was 15, a really solid metabolism, I've been told I can rock the "just rolled out of bed" look, I'm crafty/creative, and have naturally long eyelashes. Holy fuck, I hate *myself* now. I hit the lottery and didn't even know it. I'm just gonna... sit over there.	I am incredibly envious of women who can just let their hair air dry and have effortlessly perfect hair. I can't even shower away from home because if I don't have my products, straightener or blowdryer available, it's curly, messy, frizzies all in my face. And don't even get me started on swimming.
What do you think of the men who say they wouldn't mind being sexually harassed by women?	**Status: Unlocked After Moderation Clean-Up** * READ THE QUESTION. If you aren't answering it, you are derailing. * Stop derailing to make other people's responses about you. * Stop speaking for an entire gender. * Please Report All Rule-Breaking Content.	**Status: Unlocked After Moderation Clean-Up** * READ THE QUESTION.

How much does conversation matter in a relationship?	can this questions here get even more idiotic and immature? this sub sometimes reads as if feminists made male-spoof subreddit	Is it that you and your girlfriend don't talk at all or that you don't talk *for hours* in one sitting? When you first make new friends, it's very easy to have long conversations because you know nothing about each other, and everything you share is new. However, when you're in a long-term relationship, that person has already heard most of your go-to stories, thoughts, and dreams, so conversations tend to be about current events and hobbies, which don't often necessitate overly long and meaningful conversations. It's possible that you and your girlfriend are incompatible and that's why you guys have nothing to talk about, or it could be that you're both in a rut and need to spice up your lives so that they two of you have new and exciting stories to share with each other.
How long did you and your SO date before officially moving in together? What about sleeping over all the time/semi-living together?	I moved across state lines to be with him after we had been dating for a week. It worked out until it didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt regret a thing.	Officially, we moved in together after 6 months. In reality, we did that almost immediately. We‚Äôd met at a party at my dorm complex, and ended up in my room. I actually expected it to be just a nice one night stand. But then he showed up the next day, and we went to his apartment to watch movies. Or have sex, with movies playing in the background. Then he caught the flu, so naturally, I visited him to nurse him back to health. Then my dorm was being renovated and they turned off the water, so I stayed at his place, to enjoy the working toilet. After 6 months, we felt that the rent for my dorm was money wasted, and I moved into his place officially. All in all, I spent maybe two weeks in that dorm after meeting him. We‚Äôve been together for ten years now.
What female character in a TV show can you not stand no matter how much the show tries to make her likable or how much other people defend her characterization?	Kelly from the Office. She's never thankful for anything and doesn't learn from her mistakes. She's just selfish without any moments of self-awareness, and that ended up making her the one character I could never laugh at.	Robin from How I Met Your Mother. She was okay at first, but as time went on, I just couldn't stand her.
Single dad, daughter wants thongs. When is age appropriate?	My daughter is only 3, but I can't imagine being OK with thongs at 12. Highly sexualized clothing of any type is not appropriate for preteens. Honestly, I'm not sure that I'd be comfortable with it until she was 18 or so. I may be a little on the strict side, though.	Maybe the most important thing to consider is why she wants a thong. -Sounds like her main reason is to fit in with friends, which might not be such a bad thing except... -another reason might be because she feels pressure to be "sexy" or dress in a certain way. In which case it might be a good idea to have a discussion about body image, what makes a girl (woman) attractive, when that kind of attention is appropriate, etc. -always the possibility that her friends have said they are comfortable, don't show under clothes, etc. Which is probably the reason most grown women wear them, and not a bad reason. tldr; motives are key.
What was the creepiest thing (paranormal or non-paranormal) that has happened in your life?	The paranormal is all in your head or the misinterpretation of coincidence and natural phenomena. For perfectly natural creep, though, I've been down some serious dark alleys in Los Angeles at night.	I tried to sell a water filter to a guy who wanted me to climb down a ladder beneath a trap door that had a lock on it on a deck into a twenty foot deep pit to "check out the different soils"
Men, what do you consider to be "immature" in a girl?	Using lol and haha as sentence anchors when texting. Not everything needs an lol on it. Makes you look retarded	No, these are both attractive qualities. Very cute. Immature, to me, usually comes by way of playing games. Not being upfront with me, unable to have an open dialogue when a problem arises, inability to discuss anything of substance, insane jealousy, etc. I don't think natural tendencies that show affection can ever be such a bad thing
Dear men of reddit, how old were you when you realized that you are, in fact, allowed to show emotions every once in a while? Also, how if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?	I think the whole idea that "men aren't allowed to show emotions" is a meme at this point. Men have always shown emotions; in ancient times it was considered a sign of passion (and masculinity!) for a man to shed tears. So I guess to answer your question: I have never *not* known that I could express my emotions. I just... don't sit there and talk about them incessantly because when I have negative feelings, I could be *doing* something to remedy the situation/beliefs causing them.	I actually went the opposite direction. Was raised to show emotions.... Then as girl after girl cheated on me, the openness of feelings and emotions was slowly eroded from my personality. Me and my lady both just insult eachother and laugh and flip the bird constantly and go to rock concerts every chance we get. Turned out ok so far, with occasional bumps in the road.
What was life like before & after you got medication for your mental illness?	I have a good friend who is definitely the most angry hard to get along with person I know. Recently started taking some type of medication and is a completely different person. I do worry about the medication numbing the deep issues but for the current moment she's enjoyable to be around.	I feel like my meds (Prozac) reduced my symptoms by around 30 percent. Now I have the energy to do therapy, CBT, make positive changes in my life etc so then I expect that as I do those things, the symptoms will reduce further. I'm on Prozac. It really helped my mind get quieter. All of a sudden I had room in my brain to think of better things.
What fictional relationship influenced your view of romance the most and in what way?	zutara. (zuko/katara from avatar the last airbender). they were perfect. literal true love personified as far as im concerned. one of the most important questions i think i could ask a potential partner is whether they think katara should have ended up with zuko or aang. i think it shows two completely different ideals of romance, and if someone didnt hold the same ideas of what made a good, strong relationship as i did, i dont think we would be compatible.	Morticia and Gomez are more or less #couplegoals. They make an effort to maintain the excitement and passion in their relationship, they support each other, and they accept each other's weirdness.
Have you ever been in a "great friends, terrible roommates" situation? How did it work out for you?	Reading all these comments makes me eternally grateful for my best friend/roommate. We lived together last summer when her dad relocated to a job in a different state and still had a few months left on his apartment lease and it was awesome. It was one of the first places I ever felt truly comfortable and at home. We're planning on moving in together again this summer since I just went through a painful breakup and had to move back into my parents' house and I can't wait. We're both really intuitive of each other's feelings and we both regularly buy toiletries/groceries/whatever we need when we're living together. Plus, we both clean up after ourselves. I love living with her. I hope everybody here now has/finds a great roommate that they enjoy living with! <3	I have a lot of trouble living with anyone but I find it worse with close friends. I am more sensitive to them and find it hard to express how I feel with living arrangements because I fear losing their friendship as well so it complicates things so much more. Things got much better when they moved out though. Everything was less tense when the little things that you had to deal with constantly were out of the way.
Anyone else with tactless Tinder dates?	It's a hookup app. For hooking up. If you're expecting tact from horny guys on an app specifically designed for random hookups, you're gonna have a bad time.	A few months ago I went on a date with a guy from Tinder. It went really well, we got drinks then just hung out at his place and watched a movie, didn't do anything. Two days later he shows up at my work begging for me to come out to his car and suck his dick in exchange for pizza.
AskWomen of color, what unique challenges do you face in day-to-day life that others are probably unaware of?	Could you ask this question and fornulate it like AskMen of color, what unique challenges do you face in day-to-day life that others are probably unaware of?	Two things popped immediately into my mind: * Wondering if my crush likes/dates/would marry a black woman. * Finding out friends are racist. I can never tell upfront because they are not the kind of racists who run around spewing the n-word. I find out later after they've gotten comfortable enough to let little comments slip. They think I won't be offended because I'm "like them and not like other black people". The majority of these comments come from other minorities. Edit: Formatting
To women who start work early: Do you ever apply your makeup when you get to work?	I'm a dude, so can't really weigh in as much as others but I would either a) run it by my boss, so they know why I'm spending 30 min not working and applying makeup. I'd rather a heads up as a manager, but I'm sure they'd be 100% fine with it or b) ask if I could start my shift earlier or c) if you work somewhere that is in a location with bathrooms somewhere else, go do my makeup there	I am the first person at work so have no issue doing it there (in the bathroom of course, but I arrive half an hour before anyone else so it's never been an issue). Means I get to sleep in an extra 15 minutes. Worth it! I don't care if the people on the tram see me without makeup, I may as well look like a zombie while in feeling like one.
So I now have TWO IUD'S because my doctor didn't take mine out before she put the new one in... What's the most wtf medical appointment you've had?	Nothing quite as traumatic here but the Dr googled what dosage I should be on for one medication. And another gave me enough painkillers to either kill me or set me up as a drug dealer. Seriously. It's like two years later and I'm still finding them.	I was once told that my pinky finger needed to be amputated. I had gone in to talk to the doctor about pains in my ribs. He had the wrong patient chart.
Women of reddit what are some of the little things you enjoy doing for your significant other?	Head scratches, he's like a cat. Sending sexy pics cause he's obsessed with my boobs. Making his bed in the morning after I've slept at his place. Buying snacks/beer. There's not many things like this yet cause it's a very new relationship.	I pick up small gifts that he's been wanting for a long time but would never buy himself, like show tickets or a durable jacket. The only problem is I'm terrible at keeping secrets, so it's days of pure mental torture until I can finally reveal the surprise. :)
What kind of dog do you have, and why did you pick that breed?	Our family has a yellow Labrador. I actually don't like dogs (I'm sorry!) I've been attacked by them twice when I was young and have a fear of them, so when we were planning on getting one I went on a futile hunger strike against the idea. We have a yellow lab as a result of my mum's childhood dream of having a black lab called Jet, but when we went to the breeder they said the yellow one "had a big personality." Not a good move. Should have known that 'big personality' meant "will be a difficult dog." I'm not as scared of dogs anymore, but I'd be lying if I said I liked them.	I have a corgi. I came by this dog by way of taking an engagement ring to a pawn shop. The jewelry store refused to do a return, and the pawn shop offered me some cash 2 guns and a puppy. I googled the corgi puppy and besides being a shedding machine he has really filled an emotional void in my life. All in all good dog.
Men who miss at public urinals, what do your bathrooms at home look like?	Missing at home is simple. You just wipe it up. Missing in public do you really expect me to clean that shit? naw.	It's not as simple as you make it seem. Urine doesn't always flow straight out from my johnson in one orderly stream. It's like playing Russian roulette with one of those hose nozzles with 7 different spray settings.
What trait (physical or otherwise) does your SO possess that you previously found unattractive?	I don‚Äôt have a SO (yet) (hope to God) but I used to have a thing for big tits, ass, and tight clothes. Now, I don‚Äôt really care for it. All I want is a nice girl who likes and I like her.	Personality: I thought jealousy was an unattractive trait; in her it drives me crazy in the positive sense - all the way up to sexually arousing me. Physically: I never thought feet in general could be attractive, would have placed them between neutral and mildly gross, but her cute reactions when having them tickled made me like them.
Women who have done, or are doing nude modeling, stripping, camshows, porn, prostitution, etc. (jobs primarily aimed at pleasing men sensually/sexually), how has your view of men changed from before you started this work, to now?	I cam from time to time, and it shocks me how if you aren't attractive enough, then nobody will pay to watch you no matter how horny or willing you are. Personally I get quite a lot of attention whilst on the site, but I still get the odd men who click on and off without so much as a 'sorry, but you're not it for me' and it makes me think men are so much more shallow that I originally thought. Also it seems that once they've had their fun, they leave without so much as a thanks, bye. It's quite upsetting!	I've worked as a stripper since I was 17, and yes after a while it starts to distort your view of men a little bit. You get so used to seeing men at their worst. The majority of men who come to strip clubs are in relationships or married, and they always try to get something "extra" out of the lap dances, so sometimes I have a hard time believing that men are capable of being faithful. It makes me nervous to get involved romantically with any guy. I try not to let it affect me but its hard after a while. So many of my coworkers are jaded and hate their customers, especially the ones in their 30s who have been doing it their entire adult life.
XPost from AskMen: Women who have lived or live with a male SO, what were some unexpected things you learned about men from living with one?	I don't feel I've learned anything about men because I don't categorize traits into gender, even if the trait I observed was from a particular gender, because I'm not sexist. I've learned a lot about patience and hard work, though. My SO comes home from a very serious and demanding job and wants to spend two hours making authentic Thai food? How awesome is that! I've learned many ways in which people are awesome from living with my SO, I guess.	That they (at least my SO) eat so much that having a 50-50 arrangement on groceries is not the best solution.
Whats the most creepy thing a guy did while trying to be nice to you?	"Yeah I can grab you lunch .. if you give me head in return." Boyfriend at the time was coming over and told me he was already swinging by Chik Fil A and asked if I wanted anything.	Not the most creepy, but creepy still. he literally called me *m'lady* back in 2010....he also felt the need to "defend my honour" when another guy addressed me with "hey whats up" instead.
My dad wasn't around when I was growing up,what did you learn from your dad that you would pass on to someone like me?	How to build computers, tormenting knowledge, good language skills and a great choice in movies/books. Athletics or construction? Not his scene. Construction I learned at work and my Mom was always there for my athletics.	Always be presentable and take care of your reputation. You will be surprised how many opportunities will be opened or closed to you *AND* the ones you care about once people perceive/recognize the kind of person you are.
How old are you, and what‚Äôs the oldest you would date?	Mid thirties. Same age as me, I'd like to have kids at some point and a woman older than me is pretty much out of gas.	I'm 27. Last time I was on the online dating scene, I believe my profile was set to match with people up to 10 years older. Realistically, I would go higher, provided we were compatible, could keep up with each other and I found her attractive. I'm not sure I could get in a romantic, commited relationship with someone so much older than me, though - I can see a lot of inconveniences. Hookups and friendships? Sure.
Guys of Reddit, how do you tell the difference between a friendly girl and one who has feelings for you?	Whether or not I find myself inside them is a pretty good indicator as to whether the like me or not.	fuck if I know EDIT: this is the worst comment in the thread I didnt even answer OP I just fuckin typed some bullshit so I could feel like I contributed why can't you guys upvote something helpful
I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts?	No no no! Rejection is NOT a bad thing. It's almost a good thing. Even though it would be nice to snag every girl you see out there, rejection should give you the motivation to keep going. You should treat it with the lowest amount of fucks possible. Oh she rejected me? That's cute, hey look, there's an even more beautiful girl across the room from me. Rejection can save you a lot of time and heartbreak down the road too if the girl turns out to be really incompatible even in your first interaction. You have to change your perspective, it should be almost funny, the worse of a rejection they give you, the more entertained you should be by it. You gotta think you deserve every girl out there, and your friends are the losers for not having the balls to do approaches of their own!	> I want to start approaching (more) girls, but the thought of being judged by my peers as pathetic/a loser/a failure for rejection makes me terrified. Thoughts? You want my advice? Don't. Your acquaintance is an ass, whatever. Just keep up your shit and let him rot.
Those not from the US, what are some big political or social issues going on in your country right now?	In Australia - postal survey going on to test whether Australians think gay people should be allowed to marry each other, or whether we continue to discriminate irrationally against them.	In Hong Kong: * Lots of tension regarding the upcoming handover of Hong Kong to China. Many Hong Kongers, especially the younger generation, want Hong Kong independence or true democracy for Hong Kong.
Are you afraid of marrying the "safe choice"? And if you already have, what is your life like now?	Safe choice means to me a shitty sex life. This IS my fear, because I will cheat. Maybe someone can share their personal experience?	No. I think the person you marry should be "safe." Not safe as in boring or for the sake of marriage, but a person you're confident meets your needs, who makes you feel secure, and who you know is a compatible and worthy partner. That's what safe is to me.
Women who clean regularly and have consistently tidy places, please tell us your secrets?	I don't enjoy doing it. It's simply part of being an adult and keeping healthy. Seemingly, being an adult isn't cool anymore. I truly can't stand other men and women who can't maintain a presentable household, budget, or cook for themselves. Jesus Christ, it's not rocket science.	It's not that I enjoy it... it's more like the mess stresses me out more than cleaning. I usually commit one day a week towards cleaning. Even if the apartment isn't super messy, I do little things just to keep things tidy. It also helps to have little things you do each day to maintain the cleanliness. Don't leave dishes sitting at the end of the day, put the clothes away after wearing them instead of on the floor/chair, fold blankets after using them, wipe the table after each meal, etc.
In a relationship, besides jealously, what instantly screams "insecurity" to you?	Being a people pleaser. I can't be with a guy who takes longer doing his hair than I take with mine, and if they keep up with social media waaay too often.	I know a few couples that constantly post over the top lovey dovey stuff on Facebook. These are the same couples that regularly break up and get in major fights. Now every time I see someone in a couple post tons of mushy garbage, I just assume their relationship sucks and they're just trying to prove it to other people/themselves that their relationship is actually solid.
What's the most insidious way someone made your special thing all about them?	I'll offer up a light one: My partner and I went pretty non\-traditional with our wedding plans: low cost, informal ceremony, two parties a month apart, one on each coast. I made my dress, but splurged on a super cute pair of shoes I had been stalking for a year. ADORABLE Fluevog mary janes in my perfect color and style, and went so well with my dress you'd think I'd been orchestrating this for a decade. At our second party a friend of my mom's/mine sees my shoes and goes gaga over them and says "OMG I love those shoes, they would look so good on me. They are so ME!" B\*tch, you wish; you can tell me how much you envy and appreciate my style now though, thx.	I was sexually abused and scared to share it with anyone but police. I specifically told my mom not to share it because I was scared. My mother proceeded to call everyone she knew, even past neighbors we had, tell them all about it, and then talk about how hard and crippling it was *for her*.
Have you ever sat in on a Women's Self Defense Class?	210 comments on a thread about Women's Self Defense Classes and not a single mention of the best all time King of the Hill episode?! THAT'S MY PURSE!! I DON'T KNOW YOU!!!	Once. It was funny. The instructor asked me if they could use me in some demonstrations. I'm not a big guy either, 5'11 or so, 160-ish, tall and wiry with long arms. It was just a whole lot of "No, you need to stand exactly like this and come at her in *this* way, otherwise she can't try to throw you" and "No, turning your hips to shield your groin with your thigh as you grab her is unfair" and "No, you need to attack with your left hand for the move to work, not your right hand" *wtf i'm right-handed and so is a huge chunk of the population..why the fuck would I come in with my left..this is stupid* Ladies, just buy a Taser or something, because those courses are total bullshit.
When you first met your SO, were you instantly attracted to them, or did it just develop over time? How do relationships normally happen?	We started dating because a mutual friend told me that he was interested. At first I was not attracted to him but I decided to give it a shot because my friend told me he was such a nice guy. It wasn't love at first sight nor love at first date, but I felt comfortable around him and every time we hang out I discovered a new aspect of his personality that I liked. He turned out to be a very sweet, compassionate and respectful guy. We complement each other in so many ways. I started to become attracted to him more and more every moment we spent together. We've been dating for more than a year now and I couldn't be happier! Even though I wasn't attracted to him when I first met him, now he is the most handsome man in the world to me.	Saw my SO in first day of College, was like dayum. We were friends for like 3 years, now we're dating. Now I'm still like dayum whenever I see him.
WHo is a character in a movie or show who is supposed to be the romantic lead or super sexy but you just find repulsive?	No one from those twilight movies, Christain grey, Benny Cumberdrum, or whatever his name is, and that greasy guy who played Loki. I never liked Fabio, the Hemsworth brothers, and Ryan Gosling. I must be weird.	I don't know why but I can't stand Meredith Grey from Greys Anatomy. Love the show, can't stand her. I feel like her face shows almost no real emotion. Or she's a bad actress. Am I the only one who thinks this?
Have you ever had a woman be way too into you and it was uncomfortable? How did that work out?	There was a fat girl named Brianna in my high school Public Speaking class who flirted and played around with me. She was 14 while I was 17 at the time. One awkward moment came as I was doing my work and we sat next to each other. She crouched on the floor and looked up at me, saying "I can see up your nose!" That moment weirded me out. She also at one point asked me out to the prom, but I wasn't into her.	Sure, I think everyone has at one point or another. I broke up with someone after only a few months because I was being suffocated, she said 'I love you' after only knowing me for a few days, I would get the infamous '???' passive aggressive texts if I didn't respond fast enough, all that stupid shit. For weeks after we split I still got anxiety whenever my phone would go off.
How many of you drink coffee in the morning simply because it makes you poop before you leave the house?	Uh, if coffee is supposed to keep me regular then it has failed. I drink coffee because it's delicious and perks me up.	I drink coffee because I like the taste and the caffeine. Regular and consistent bowel movements are just a bonus.
What is the most disgusting thing you've seen on Reddit?	Mostly abject sexual degeneracy: theredpill, people claiming sex with underage people/animals/children/family members is morally ambiguous, some girl who had slept with over 100 men, and some guy who as a fetish got his balls chopped off. I don't know what it is about gross sexual stuff/attitudes that I hate so much but I really do	That guy who defended pedophilia and bragged about raping a 9 year old. Edit: And the ones about Carl H.
Anyone go from fit to fat? Did you get depressed, and how are you doing now?	Was never really fit the way you describe, but I was a regular runner and supplemented with weights at times. I got more responsibility at work, and my wife and I were expecting a child, so I got lazy and sedentary. Next thing I knew I had this bulging gut and was 20 pounds heavier than I had ever been. Shirts that had easily fit me now were disturbingly tight. It was a little depressing, but I got into eating right with Myfitnesspal and joined a gym. Lost 30 pounds. Felt good again.	I was a bike messenger for a while, which allowed me to eat & drink pretty much anything I wanted. Then 3 years ago I sold all my stuff and moved to Japan to teach English. It's a sedentary job with long hours, which has made it tough to get out on the bike, and my tiny rural town has no gym. Stress-related emotional eating & drinking, plus a high-carb Japanese diet caused me to put on a LOT of weight in my first year. I've since started to lose some of that weight, but it's a slow process, and I'm still bummed about it when I look in the mirror. To all you guys who are trying to make things right and get fit again, keep on keepin' on!
Favorite yoga pants or leggings?	Lululemon. I never understood the craze til I bought a pair. It's quite pricey but they're made very well. If anything goes wrong, you can easily exchange for a brand new pair. I have one that is 2.5 years old but still looks/wear like new. Bombshell Sportswear.	I love the ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù fabric leggings from Aerie, they come in lengths and some have big pockets on the sides, and the lining on the inside is like fleece! Super cozy.
A woman that you have gone on a couple of dates with asks you over to her place at 10pm on a Friday to watch a movie and says "I hope you like alcohol because I have a lot." How do you think the night will go?	If she invited you over to chill and watch a movie, there‚Äôs a very strong chance you were invited over to chill and watch a movie. She was probably down for the night to go in either direction but your pushing made her uncomfortable and she shut down. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get laid. But hey, now you know.	I'll get blackout drunk and deliver one of my famous drunken monologues on whatever off brand topic is on my mind this week before waking up in the morning hung over and embarrassed.
What's your embarrassing childhood story that your family always brings up?	In my family's dining room there is a buffet (a piece of furniture, not a restaurant) that has a bunch of family pictures on it. One of those pictures is of a cute smiling little baby girl, which people usually assume is my sister. It's not though, it's me. I have a cousin that was born the day before me, and one time she and I were getting babysat by our aunt as our parents went out golfing. Our aunt decided it would be funny to switch our clothing, so she did. My dad loves to tell people about that and how they called me Lucretia because of it. I didn't even have any sort of control during my embarrassing story. I was an adorable baby though.	Crackers. On my 5th Christmas, my mom wrapped a stuffed elephant in a cracker box. When I unwrapped it, I yelled "**CRACKERS! I GOT CRACKERS!!**" Now I get a present in a crackers box every year. I'm 35 years old.
Guys that cheated on their SO and were forgiven. How's that relationship going?	It's going great. Went from GF to Wife. It was definitely rocky at times afterward and took time to rebuild trust. Been over a year now since the incident and I'd say we are in a perfect place. I'm sure she still has her own moments, internally, where she questions things but she has always had jealousy problems that she constantly reminds me of.	Girlfriend and I both cheated on each other during a very unhealthy relationship. We broke up but got back together 6 months later. We then enjoyed a fairly decent 3.5 year relationship before she cheated on me again. I guess I thought if I changed, then she would too. I was wrong.
What's your favorite lady-to-lady term of endearment?	Sis is up there at number 1. However I try to be careful with gendered terms because I don‚Äôt want to potentially hurt anymore!	A homeless man recently called me "sis" and I loved it. I aspire to call other women that. I use "lady" and sometimes "mama" or "girl". "Chica" and "babe" feel dated to me. I worked as a bartender in college and "Hon" is my least favorite ToE.
Am I the only one who feels like this sub has a severe childfree bias? Why do you think that is?	I don't like other people's children, but I like my own kids. If I had to decide whether or not I was EVER going to have kids based on dealing with everyone else's kids, I never would have had them. I mean, some other kids are okay, but I don't often find many.	* Reddit leans childfree in general * Reddit skews demographically young. Younger people feel less constrained by expected gender roles, but also may feel more strongly about the issue than older people * People who feel they're going against the grain on an issue like that may feel it's notable enough to mention. * Confirmation bias * Parents may have less time for Reddit
What is the number 1 rule on your Bro Code?	I just assumed naturally, that when I tell the guys things, they aren't going to turn around and contact my girlfriend and rat me out. I had a guy do that to me once when I made a joke about my girlfriend to him and he tried to finagle his way into a relationship with her by breaking us up. It only ended up causing a fight. Anyway, it was low class. Whenever guys tell me things like they are cheating or whatever, I don't tell anyone that stuff. I also don't play games with ultimatums or second chances. He betrayed me once and that was it. I still hung out with him, but I never told him anything worthwhile again.	If your bro asks seriously for help, you do it. Doesn't matter if you feel shitty, if he really needs you, buckle down and help him. I've had to ask, and I've been asked. You value it because if you need them, they're there. Just kinda sucks when you have to drive 30 minutes to help them dissemble a keggerator and pack it up for moving.

How do you fit and betray your stereotype?	Standard geek Fit: * Overweight * nearsighted * sloppily dressed and shaved * mostly talk about my field (information technology, specially as it pertains to the web) * live with my parents (though I can afford living somewhere else and have done so already, but since currently I'm working in my hometown, there's no point spending the extra money). Betray: * I'm pretty liberal and egalitarian * don't like that many "geeky" things (not interested in conventions, board games, video games, games of any kind, only three tv shows, only one of which really intended at geeks; and I only watch genre movies because I watch *all* movies) * am interested in music and will probably/definitely take singing and dancing lessons this year EDIT: Format.	Stereotype: big native american Fit: Quiet Meek until provoked Physically strong but slow and deliberate Outdoorsy Kind of a drunk Betray: Well-read Technologically inclined Social chameleon Non-spiritual Can't stand having long hair
Reddit admins just announced that subs that promote raping women and the like will be banned. Will this make reddit a better place for women?	Personally I don't support the banning of any subreddit which is not actively promoting distasteful content outside of itself or consisting primarily and deliberately of content that can only exist through exploitation, abuse or any other deplorable behaviour outside the confines of the subreddit. I don't believe /r/rapingwomen falls under those criteria (it's self-admittedly a satire sub) and thus I think it ought to simply become unlisted (or whatever they're going to call it). That said, I am definitely in the very pro-free-speech camp, and I'd support anyone who decided a place that allowed such discussion is not for them. I just don't think said people should choose whether or not to blanket allow discussion of controversial topics.	I mean, it is not going to miraculously solve all of reddits problems, but it is a step in the right direction. Just because it 'might not change anything' doesn't mean that not doing anything about it is the best approach. Kinda mad that Ellen got so much backlash for banning 5 subs, and now the original co founder is banning things and there is no where near the level of backlash. Also, I am getting so much entertainment over this reddit drama.
Ladies with breast implants - how did your life change, for better or worse, post-surgery?	My wife got them a year ago. This morning she came to me and said "It is nice looking at myself in the mirror". She went from having to sloppy hotpockets after 3 breastfeedings to perky 75D's, and to be honest, it is the best 5k‚Ç¨ I have ever spent. She is much happier with her body, and is a much more comfortable being. Bonus-edit: Best thing about them is that I get to buy a lot of sexy lingerie to her - I average one nice set per month that I buy for her. One of my favorite activities.	Only changed for the better. I had no breasts. Not even AA. I come from a long line of tiny, breastless women. So I got B cups, and I have been happy ever since. I felt like such a child without them. I hardly felt like a girl. I am not ashamed of them at all. If it comes up, I proudly tell people I have implants.
What is something you own that is overkill for the purpose you bought it?	I told my wife I wanted an AR15 for home defense. I ended up buying that and another upper for a .50 BEOWULF. That round will drop a charging elephant. Totally overkill but WTF not right	I mentioned to my SO that I needed a potato masher. I just had a plastic, inexpensive one in mind, but he went out and bought a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer because he once heard it "does everything." When I laughed and said "I just meant the little handheld one!" he turned around and bought an immersion blender. I still don't have a potato masher.
What 'hero' character isn't really such a good person?	Harry Potter is a jerk but Hermione is a legitimately bad person and I'm baffled that she's considered a good role model by so many. She's a snob who (along with Ginny) looks down her nose at girls who have more traditionally girly personalities/interests (Fleur, Lavender). She permanently disfigures a girl's face for protecting her mom's job just out of pettiness instead of a more logical thing like warning people who signed onto the DA they'd get hexed if they snitched. Worst of all, she lets Umbridge get taken by the centaurs. In Greek mythology, centaurs always wanted to rape humam women, and there's no way she didn't know that. In general I find JK is super biased in her writing and not very good at writing actual heroes, but Hermione is a nasty, self-righteous person.	SpongeBob. Even if he means well, things usually end up going to pure chaos because of how selfish and idiotic his thought process is.
What was your most recent deep conversation with your SO about? Did you feel better after?	We talked about our baby timeline last night, but it wasn't super deep. I'm so excited about it. The last deep one we had about us was last week, after an argument that lasted too long and at the end we realized we agreed with each other. We essentially argued for nothing, but that happens to us sometimes. We took a step back to explore why we talk "around" each other sometimes, and why we get so defensive that we miss what the other is *actually* saying in the moment.	Having a child. I thought I felt better, but really we just go in circles. For some context, we‚Äôre both fence sitters. I thought we were leaning towards having one, but now I think we‚Äôre leaning against. We‚Äôve been talking about this for a year. I just want to pick a side and be done with the conversation. Edit - words
My SIL is pregnant, but husband and I don't plan on procreating any time soon (if ever). What are some tactful, graceful, and/or funny ways to respond to "You're next!" comments?	If it's an older person saying it to you, say it back to them at the next funeral you're both at	I once heard someone suggest, "Every time someone says that, we wait another year." I still haven't decided if it's funny or rude, could go either way.
What's the dumbest thing you've said to a girl just to keep a conversation going because you didn't want it to end?	Where I live, there is a really good coffee chain called Dutch Bros. Its very popular with girls in my area. I have gotten girls to spill their guts and open up just by asking "So, do you like Dutch Bros?" Works every time.	I'm female, but I've had a few guys try to show me things so I wouldn't leave. Ex. all the sweaters they own, all the food in their cupboard, all their climbing gear...they would talk about each item. It was dumb, but also kind of endearing.
How does your SO initiate sex? How do you like it?	My last SO never did, and I preferred she didn't, anyway. i'm a domme. I liked taking her any time I felt. And, most of the time, she liked me doing it.	I'll be relaxing in the living room. He'll come out of the bedroom, and with a smirk say, "can I borrow you for thirty minutes?". Yep. That's how he does it.
Ladies who left college without graduating, how did it turn out? What are you up to now?	I'm not a lady but I did drop out of university. Was studying history. It sucks! Trying to find a crappy job but so far in vain. *Halp!*	I am back in school and doing way better than I was. I am really glad I left because I am actually pursuing a degree I really enjoy now. I dropped out after a semester, worked several jobs until I found a decent one with benefits. Realized I detested the career field and really wanted to keep learning, and went back into college around age 24.
What preconceptions did you have about men which you later learnt weren't true?	1. That a guy could want a marriage more than I do! (my current situation right now). I used to think all of them didn't want to settle down, be a bachelor forever, etc. 2. That ALL of them grow overwhelming chest/back/leg/butt hair after a certain age (not the case at all) 3. That they're terrible cooks, excluding "professional chefs" of course... see above. Probably reinforced by my local culture, where men don't really cook at all. 4. That a man could be into shoes/fashion more than any woman I know (that's my brother) 5. That they are all more assertive/less introverted than me. However, all the guys I've liked were far more shy than I am!	The first time I saw a penis in real life (my current boyfriend) I had no idea what a "grower" was, or that they even existed. So my reaction in my head went from "It's not that big but that's ok" to "OH OK NEVERMIND".
What does child birth/being in labor feel like?	Just remember as bad as it hurts our bodies where created to handle the pain and giving birth. Otherwise we would never have children after the first one. It's honestly different pain for everyone and every pregnancy. I'd say cramps and back pain are probably the most common symptoms. The good news is that they have drugs that they can give you at a certain point to ease the pain. They don't work correctly all the time but do most of the time. The end result is definitely worth the work. :)	At first it was like bad menstrual cramps, then it progressed to something far more painful, as if my uterus was trying to escape my body. Then I had an epidural and slept through most of it feeling no pain.
What is something a ton of people brag about, but you aren't impressed with?	NOT wanting kids. This applies to Reddit especially. I fully support people not wanting to have kids, they should have that choice and there's nothing inherently worse about not having kids, BUT there's nothing inherently better either. Choosing not to have kids doesn't make you a better person, smarter or more enlightened, than someone who chose to have kids ("chose" being the operative word here, as in, someone who made a well-thought and responsible choice, rather than had kids because they didn't know birth control existed or didn't have access to it, or did it out of societal pressure).	Drinking. How much they drink. How often they drink. All of the "crazy" stories they have from drinking that are more of an indication that they have a problem than something they should be proud of.
Would you like to see naked photos of my GF?	Depends if he'd lend me his phone to whack off. Picture a gibbon masturbating at the zoo. With a phone. That'd be me.	No matter what happens, any pictures given to me have never and will never be shown to other people. It is disrespectful. Even if we argue and completely fall out; even if she disappears from my life; even if she cheats on me. I refuse to stoop to such a level. EDIT: Wow :O thanks for the Reddit Gold, anonymous awesome person!
Mothers, what is the most embarrassing thing your child has ever done?	I‚Äôm not sure if this is what u mean but it sure was embarrassing when my 19 year old scrolled the wrong way on my pics and seen my naughty pics lmao	Well, last week my son announced to the people at the park that we were growing "lots of penises" in our garden. Carrots. We harvested carrots.
How should a guy initiate the first kiss?	If this sub has taught me anything it's that you ask her, then get express written consent, signed and notarized.	Look, there's nothing foolproof. If you're looking for body language and situational cues you're on the right track, and if you sometimes get "the eyes" and sometimes get a kiss, you clearly don't "always" fuck it up. Personally, I don't mind at all if a guy asks if he can kiss me or says he wants to‚Äîmuch prefer that than a guy I'm making awkward polite chitchat with while his friend shifts my friend at a bar suddenly trying to shove his tongue down my throat‚Äîbut again, it might not work every time and that's kinda just something you have to deal with.
What was your experience with women who were bad at sex?	Honestly I would say most women I've met are bad at sex. Maybe my grading curve is skewed from a handful of really good/compatible partners. But most women I've been with seem to think that any sex is good sex in the eyes of a man. With that said my first really bad experience wasn't something she could change. Sex was either painful or uncomfortable for her, she was a trooper but neither of us finished. Tried a lot more foreplay the next time, took it slow. Same results. Told her I was sorry but this wouldn't work for me. There is a huge difference between that and starfish sex.	Had a girl not move and make no noise. She wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. She just kept staring at the wall. I feel at this point I do need to mention it was completely consensual and she initiated. After she said she was nervous and it was her first time since her and her husband divorced.
Do you have a disappointing engagement story? How did it turn out?	Your engagement is not terribly important. Your wedding is not terribly important. What is important is your marriage, and your partner. And the biggest part of a successful partnership is good communication. If you're so concerned with having a big fancy surprise engagement with the "right" ring, then communicate what it is you want. If you expect him to read your mind, prepare to be disappointed.	My ex proposed to me on my 21st birthday in a cab (he proposed many times but this one is the time with a ring). He gave me a ring that he later gave to someone else while we were on a break. We got back together, then when we broke up (again), I saw it on a different girl that I considered a friend. He later tried giving it back to me when he ditched her and ran back home. That ring was kind of like the sisterhood of the traveling pants, except none of us had a nice time and we all hated each other. Ah, young love.
How enthusiastic does your SO get when it comes to giving oral sex?	My woman gives UNBELIEVABLE Head... and, she swallows. But, her VijayJay is even more UNBLEIVABLE. Though, I admit I give her Waayyy... more head than she gives me, and I Love it just as much as getting it.	I only get it when she feels like it and so the degrees vary. She is always pretty enthusiastic but i can tell how horny she is by how hard she goes at it.
Short women, where do you buy your pants?	I‚Äôm five feet and honestly never have a problem. I buy jeans from Topshop when there‚Äôs a sale, American Eagle, and Abercrombie & Fitch. When there‚Äôs a short option I choose it. If not, I get the regular ones and cuff them if I want to.	american eagle, they usually have "short" length pants in store and while they are pricier they last a long time and their jeans are comfortable af!!
As a 21-year-old female, what are some skills I should learn or habits I should start that would be useful in the long term?	You should absolutely be at least basically familiar with how to use microsoft office stuff. You should know how to make a basic excel spreadsheet, type up a word document, make a powerpoint. You should be familiar with acceptable fonts (times new roman, arial) and unacceptable fonts (comic sans) for both formal and semi-formal writing. This may seem like it is silly or a no brainer, but you should also know how to compose a clear, concise email. When applying for a job, interacting with your boss, or doing work related projects, these tools are invaluable and are often the yard stick by which other people will judge you. Learning to look professional in an electronic format is critical to your success.	Eating healthy and exercise. Make both of these part of your daily routine. Schedule shopping trips, cooking time, and gym time into your days so that you can't miss them. Prioritize these the way you would a doctor's appointment. If you think you don't have time to take care of yourself, you'll have to eventually find a lot time to recover from being sick, whether it's immediately from an injury, or down the line from a chronic illness. The best time to create healthy habits is when you're young.
What was the dumbest reason a girl gave you for not wanting to date you or when breaking up with you?	I was this girl: he had a toothpick habit and that‚Äôs what I told him when I broke up with him. I mean he carried them around everywhere and picked his teeth at the table. Legit nicest dude I have ever dated. Funny, smart, sweet, decent earner, had a great family and probably would have made an excellent partner and co-parent. All around everything a girl could ask for. But I could not get past the toothpicks and the vision of my future of picking up these wet tiny pieces of wood all over the house.	High school era...I dated a girl for two weeks. She dumped me because I didn't pay enough attention to her. Problem was, she didn't tell me we were dating. I said maybe 5 words to her at some party, and have never seen her since. Her friend told me. I had no idea what she was talking about, and didn't even know my new ex's name yet.
John Kasich says you can avoid being raped by not drinking at parties: what would you say to the women who were enthusiastically clapping for that statement?	All too common reminder that we have rules against derailing, invalidation, and generally being an asshole. Please keep that in mind before you decide to post your Devil's advocate-style comments.

Fellow retail workers: What was the most wtf thing a customer has ever said to you?	"what do you mean there is no replacement part for this 60year old pen"? -old dude "The company that made those special pens doesn't exist anymore" -me "surely you have some stock left?" -_- some people need to be cleansed from the genepool	I had a woman returning a dress that she purchased and then decided she didn't want. She told me I needed to give her gas money for her having to drive back out to the store to return a dress that had nothing wrong with it. I had a guy try and guess my cup size while he was buying a shirt for his girlfriend.
What is the dumbest/most embarrassing/most cringeworthy thing you've done for someone you liked?	I have wrote a long "I like you" letter in my cellphone when we both were in a bar... She read it, then kissed me and said "but I just don't want any rings on me" I just paralized, started to laught and hugged her... Then never touched in the subject again... Until now I just can't compreend WTF did i made in that day...	I was still in my teens. And in a foolish moment of drunken lust, I emailed a cringeworthy "confession" of my feelings to my crush, who was also a student coworker. I threw in every corny cliche I knew, including something about us walking along beaches together. She never responded, at least not directly to me. Instead she wrote an opinion column in the campus newspaper that appeared two days later, taking to task how people who annoyingly gush out confessions of their affection over email. I wasn't named at least, but my email was extensively quoted.
As a Brit I don't understand why Hilary Clinton is so vilified. Can you explain?	Because she is a woman in politics. The men have done things just as bad or worse than her and they get praise, or at least arent as hated.	Personally I don't like her because my perception is that she has corporate interests in mind more than the wellbeing of the people.
I'm sick of all the anti-child bias here. What DO you like about kids?	That they won't be children forever. Oh, and I like that there are people, saints really, who actually like those little shits so that I don't have to deal with them.	I am child-free, but I generally like kids. I like talking to them and hearing the crazy or wondrous things they have to say. I like that they always wanna play and I have someone who's totally down to play hide n seek, tag, or board games (and I'm almost 30). I like giving advice to teenagers too, because i went through some shit and feel I can relate. I like smiling babies that just beam positivity. I like the hope I see in the good kids who are gonna be something later in life. I have my own reasons for not wanting any of my own, but I certainly will help be a positive experience for the little ones I come across.
Is lusting for other women (wanting to bone them) while you‚Äôre in a loving monogamous relationship ok, or normal and why?	Matthew 5:28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Do you want her to do you like that? Luke 6:31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.	Looking and finding other people attractive is normal. But after that, it gets very grey. Imagine the roles are reversed and you are witnessing your wife lusting after her male coworker, checking him out, imagining what sex with him is like, getting the adrenaline rush from flirtations, etc. It would probably bum you out to realize that a lot of her time was spent daydreaming about other dudes‚Äô dicks. Just make sure you aren‚Äôt allocating a huge chunk of your time to fantasizing about other people and that you are still finding ways to engage with your actual partner.
How can we create a main-stream dialog surrounding male issues similar to how women have done?	>without trying to trample on feminist spaces or try be detracting from the feminist movement as a whole So basically you want to form a movement that is feminism's bitch?	I think a lot of it has to do with the expectations of men to be this stoic, unemotional figure, and that by discussing anything like this, it's seen as a sign of weakness, which is a load of bollocks. It takes guts to admit you might need a bit of help from time to time. Bottling it all up is harmful and doesn't let you find a solution. One thing you can do is just make sure your mates are OK if you think they need it, doesn't have to be tears and ice cream, but just go for a beer or whatever, I find just being able to share perspectives is a great help.
When did you realize someone close to you couldn't be trusted?	Fuck his gf to get back at him/her. Have a couple though. One former friend for whatever reason did a complete 180 and started shit talking me and showing screenshots of our convos to someone she knew I really, really did not like. Another former friend flat out blocked me when I voiced an opinion about disagreeing with the war in Iraq. He apparently thought that I thought all the military did there was kill babies or some shit, which I don't, but whatever.	Be happy. You just cut two toxic people from your life. As I've aged, I've cut back my friend circle tremendously. I really only have time for a few, and I want those to be the best.
[Serious] How do you cope with being relatively physically unattractive?	Pretty enough to get noticed but not pretty enough to get a guy to ask me out. Mostly a high school dilemma, thankfully. I just cried and hoped someone would find me attractive enough one day. Good news, it happened. Happily in a relationship with a guy who thinks I‚Äôm prettiest. To the point where we‚Äôve stopped prettying up for each other unless we‚Äôre going out together.	Besides the obvious (lose weight, work on yourself), realize that while the majority of people might not find you conventionally attractive, some people do. If there is something about your appearance that you hate but can be fixed (weight, teeth, hair), figure out ways to fix it. You need to be happy with yourself but not for anyone else. Wear the kind of makeup you want to wear. Realize that people are way too invested in themselves to worry too much about you. The ones who DO focus on your issues are paranoid themselves about what others think.
What negative stereotypes do you fit into perfectly?	I'm bisexual and polyamorous. I can't do monogamy. And I have cheated before. I'm a feminist with hairy armpits - though I don't think that's bad... I'm latina and hot blooded.	I'm a ginger and my temper is epic. I don't have the short fuse redheads are supposed to I can take a lot before I go off, but when I do, it's time to duck and cover.
Hi ladies, what is something you would like to talk about right now but have nobody to talk to?	Been married five days, already received two cards addressed to Mr and Mrs [HisLastName]. I am not changing my name. I'm Ms [MyLastName] just like before. Just the fact people assumed and didn't even fucking ask me! (There are people I could talk to but I'm not gonna text them out of nowhere just to complain.)	I'm getting fact checking fatigue and it's making me really disappointed in people and apathetic toward politics. I'm super liberal but I see just as many liberals as conservatives passing off nonsense as facts and posting stupid memes covered in lies. And then when I very politely post a reliable source that proves the lie is a lie, I get called nasty names, or sometimes they'll say "Okay, thanks for providing a source!" and then they're reposting the same shit the next day. I don't get it. You have access to the greatest information source ever to exist and yet you can't be bothered to google whatever crap your posting and liking and upvoting.
Non-white women, how do you differentiate (or do you) between someone who is attracted to your ethnicity and someone who is fetishizing you?	I'm white as far as anyone can tell, but I've been stereotyped in certain ways and it's never impressive. It's one thing to like red hair or smooth brown skin or a big ass or devotion to family or a freak in the sheets or w/e. It's another to assume someone will act a certain way because of the way she looks. That's just gross.	When guys tell me they've "never fucked a black girl" or "I wanna see that big, ghetto ass", it's usually a good tip off that a guy is just into me because of my race.
Have you ever dated a guy but when you saw him naked for the first time lost all interest?	I know I'm nitpicking, but it's a wom*an*, several wom*en*. They're pronounced very differently, woman is pronounced woman, women is pronounced like "wimmen". I see this mistake a lot on reddit, and it drives me up the wall! :)	No - if I'm getting naked with someone, I'm probably first nervous about my own body, and then just excited to be with them. If we're at that stage, then that Amy Pond quote probably already applies. > You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful and then you actually talk to them and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick? Then there's other people, when you meet them you think, "Not bad. They're okay." And then you get to know them and... and their face just sort of becomes them. Like their personality's written all over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful. EDIT: Added the quote to this comment as well as one below.
What is the dumbest way you've accidentally hurt your own balls?	I was playing with a 10-gallon bucket in the shower. The bucket had a rope handle. I held the handle as high as I could while water flowed into the bucket. The bucket became to heavy and the rope was unable to support the weight. The nearly full bucket fell down on to my balls and the lip of the bucket cut my dick. I then put a band-aid on my dick boo-boo and after I applied the band-aid I realized taking the band-aid off would hurt a lot and it did. Needless to say, all three incidents hurt a lot.	I was really drunk and thought it would be funny to run, grab onto a light pole, and swing around using my leg. I was nearly blackout drunk and don't actually know how to do that... so I just basically ran at the pole and jumped at it crotch first. Bad times... bad times.
How do I politely tell a guy that I don't want to sleep with him on the first date?	I hate this world. This behavior is normal and don‚Äôt let them tell you it isn‚Äôt. Why should you *have to* politely tell him that you don‚Äôt want to sleep with him on the first, or even second date. These days it seems like they just want to use our body and we are so afraid to be honest about needing more time because we are afraid they will leave. Someone that has suffered sexual abuse I find it impossible to have a relationship with anyone because it‚Äôs always them demanding sex before I‚Äôm even comfortable with being around them. Men in my experience are way to fast.	Unfortunately, you might have to be straightforward. Tell them you‚Äôre not willing or conmfortable on the first night. If you‚Äôre still interested in them though, I think you can still tell them how much you enjoyed yourself and would like to go another date. If they keep pushing/pressuring you, end it. It sucks, but you should never feel you have to be pressured into something you don‚Äôt want to do. Also, sex does not have to equal being in a relationship. Your friends have the wrong mindset.
Those who married young and are still together, what‚Äôs your story?	I first got married at 20 but it was on/off for three years. A few months after the divorce was finalized, I married again (to someone who was a few weeks shy of 25). It‚Äôs been close to seven years and we are still together. He‚Äôs very happy but I‚Äôm not THAT happy despite is a problem he‚Äôs trying to fix (it‚Äôs related to his health).	I got accidentally knocked up at age 19 and we got married a little while after baby was born. He was not that young though, he was already established in his career, he's older than me. Honestly I don't know for sure why it worked, we weren't even really in love when we were hooking up, it's something that developed throughout the pregnancy. 20ish years later we're perfectly happy , I mean I wouldn't change a thing.
Men, how much sharing of your sex life by your SO with their friends would upset you?	Here's what she's sharing: anything that isn't overly embarrassing to her. She's probably sharing just about everything else which is worth mentioning and there's nothing you can really do about it.	I have to admit that I get really irritated at women that share intimate details about me with their friends. I just don't understand it as I would personally never share any kind of information about the "bedroom activities". I'm also a very private person, so it might be mostly that. Plus there are some things about me that I feel very insecure about, so the less the lady I'm seeing shares, the better. In my understanding women do this more than men and I personally never understood why. Maybe some of the ladies here could explain why they feel the need to share those intimate details about their sex life with their friends?
Would you ever have sex in public? If you have, what happened?	Does the movie theater count? If so, it was awesome. With the lack of a condom she ended up taking a shot in the mouth then decided to spit it out at the end of the isle. And then literally, LITERALLY as soon as she sat back down a huge group of people walked into the theater. Shaunna if you're reading this...I miss you lmao	There is something very in touch with nature about fucking on a hike. Some of my favorite times having sex were bending a girl over a convenient boulder out in the wild. I tend to stay off of the main trails though, wouldn't be good to be balls deep in her when some family comes hiking up the trail.
Women of Reddit who did not go to college: What is your job? Are you struggling to make ends meet?	Well I do have a degree and I'm currently working a $12 an hour job. So be happy you at least don't have loans to pay too. I did have a job as a nanny where I made $20 an hour.	If you like babies/kids - be a nanny! I did go to college for 5 semesters, but I dropped out due to finances. And because of that- my transcript has been on hold til I can pay 30k üôÉüôÉüôÉ I‚Äôm a full time nanny/housekeeper and I love it. I make between $15-16 an hour after taxes are taken out. I wish I made more and had a degree obviously, but I like what I do and live alone without trouble paying my bills. And living in the heart of Dallas with a fairly high cost of living, that‚Äôs saying something. IMO. Just throwin it out there ! :)
Men of AskMen, what's the most Macgyver thing you've ever done?	I bought a Christmas tree, but it turned out some of the lower branches made it unable to fit into the holder. I didn't have a saw, so I ended up taking my drill and drilling holes in the branches until I was able to break them off by hand.	I didn't get any solar glasses, so just an hour ago I threw together a pinhole camera for today's eclipse while at work using a frozen burrito box, a soda bottle cap, a thumbtack, and some tape. It's sitting right next to me on my desk. I love astronomy, but I'm also a huge procrastinator.
Donald and Ivanka got me thinking. How is your relationship with your father?	My dad is cool. He rides motorcycles and plays bass. He's always been super supportive of everything I've done and helped get me through undergrad financially and otherwise. Now, I'm almost done with my Ph.D. and he is very proud. He's retired and divorced now. He works on doing his own stuff for the most part since me and my brother are much older now.	Great. When I was a kid, my dad didn't interact with me much. I have since found out this is because he, like me, has no idea how to interact with children. As an adult we have long conversations about work, friends, social problems, etc.
Women who didn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the one‚Äù feeling right from the beginning with their SO, how are you holding up?	. Sometimes I think that the world can‚Äôt really handle that crazy passionate mad insane love for too long. You have to have two extremely healthy people because what those feelings do to us- is bring out every single worst characteristic we have ..... every issue we have. Because we get afraid .... and it rarely very rarely happens that you have two people that can handle gracefully that kind of fear - The best relationships are the ones where you are best friends... sex is one hour out of the day. What are you going to do with the other 23?	We met on a blind date. I thought he was a pompous ass. He seemed to like me. He kept after me for 6 months. When I moved to another town, he was the only person to call me and wish me luck. He called everyday to check on me. He became my best friend. He finally told me he loved me and asked me to be his. I said okay...22 years...18 years of marriage...and 5 children ago. He is the love of my life.
What attracted you to a woman that caught you off guard?	Her small frame. I'd like to have an experience with a girl that I can actually use to jerk off with instead of to.	If you like/know other languages hearing someone talk in their native tongue knocks my socks off. Also hearing them speak with an accent is really sexy as well.
How much does your current SO know about your past love life?	I always let them know I‚Äôve taken massive dongs in the past so I always have that over them, that look in their eyes when they know you‚Äôve already been conquered by a bigger beast üëÄ	He knows as much as he wants to know. I'm always open for questions about my past and he's open to answering any questions I might have, which have been very few. Honestly, his past is his past and helped shape him into the wonderful husband and man I call my best friend. Same for my past. The events in it were important in creating who we are today but that's about it. The past stays in the past as we walk forward into our future together.
Those of you over 35, what's a misconception you had about women and relationships when you were younger that you now understand?	That you have to pander to their every whim and treat them like princesses. That's a good way to get yourself cheated on.	the concept of maturity - i'm over 35 and just as many people are stuck in high school as there were at 25.
What muscle do you have to put very little work into at the gym for it to come out looking great?	I don't do gym, but somehow my quads just got stronger and stronger hiking, climbing and backcountry skiing. Basically, lots of activities where you gain altitude through leg power. The problem is that it overpowers my hamstrings giving me pelvic tilt :/	Forearms. I do literally no work on them specifically, but they look great. My evidence is that I can hardly get anything done if I have my sleeves rolled up to the elbow when working around the house. Wife will jump me, guaraneteed.
What's your wildest online purchase you've made while inebriated?	I once tried to order a $1 Billion dollar bill from Zimbabwe for like $12 USD but fell asleep and when I looked at my cart the next day I realized I almost accidently ordered 1 Billion $1 Bills.	At 2AM I was browsing Amazon and adding things to my wish list. Turns out I was adding them to 1-click ordering. A few days later my 7 year-old told me UPS was at the door with a trailer. They had a hand truck that included a professional quality dehydrator, speakers, salad dressings, facial scrub, and the list does on. I didn't want to admit to my significant other that I had no idea what was happening so now I'm in the jerky business, and she secretly adds things to my wish list.
My girlfriend just said "I'm obsessed with your face" what are some of the weirdest compliments you've received?	That i have nice calves. I have no tattoos and thats where i wanted to put my first tattoo partially because of the compliment. But she doesn't want me to get one there. Women are baffling.	"I really like the way your hair is dark in the middle" My 8 year old nephew reminding me that I needed to do my roots.
How does it make you feel when a woman says she "feels safe with you"?	A little annoyed, like now I'm going to get blamed when she feels unsafe because I'm not around. I really have things to do.	I recently had a girl stay over my place, we slept in the same bed but nothing happened because, while we had both been drinking, I was pretty sober. In the morning she told me I made her feel safe and kissed me goodbye. She then blocked me on everything and we haven't spoken since. So now I just feel confused.
What is the worst thing you've ever overheard after the other party forgot to hang up, buttdialed, or thought you were out of earshot? How did you handle it?	My ex butt-dialed me once. However he left a voicemail, and in the message he was talking to his cousins about beating some guy's ass. A few days later, he tells me that he got into a fight and I was a wreck. It was the start of me realizing that I couldn't be with this man anymore	My parents broke up when I was in high school. My dad moved to a 2br apartment, and I would come stay with him every other week. The divorce was a huge blow to my mom who started dating and drinking a lot. Well, one day I was at the apartment by myself and checking the phone messages. There was this one new message that sounded like a buttdial, but I was curious so I kept listening. I could hear muffled voices. And then moans. And then unmistakeably my mom's voice. She had recently started seeing a new guy, so I'm assuming he was the male voice I could then hear. I'm still not sure if this was unintentional or if she wanted to shove this in my dad's face as retribution for him leaving her. I'm hoping for the former, but it's definitely haunted me ever since.
How do YOU know your SO loves you?	I actually am polyamorous and my husband still wants to be with me despite this. That's asking a whole heck of a lot that I know the majority of people would not be willing to put up with. (He is free to see other women for the record.)	For the most part, beyond him saying it, its random little things like: picking me up a bomber of my favorite beer when I am having a rough time/or in crampy hell, giving me a passionate smooch when I am just on the computer or making food, waiting for me when we hike a rough trail and I cant go as fast as him. There is a lot that is hard to verbalize (like how he looks at me, or the way he says my name), but a big one is he makes me feel loved when I feel utterly unlovable.
What do you wish you did/knew while in high school?	I wish I had discovered drugs sooner, instead of buying into all the DARE crap. I wish I had taken school more seriously and tried to nab a scholarship to a college. I wish I knew which friends weren't my friends at all. And I really wish I didn't care about seeking approval from so many people who looked down on me. I coulda been a lot happier!	How to not be afraid of rejection. Everyone has that one person they miss not asking. I had, and kinda still, a gigantic crush on this girl. I wish I had gone for it.
What do you wish you knew before starting therapy?	Make sure it‚Äôs a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program. This program will give you the techniques to be successful. It is hard work but it will help you. Going and whining at someone once a week will not help you in the long run.	1. Be honest, share everything, do not censor yourself. 2. The work is done in between sessions, where you practice what you talked about, practice introspection, and work to change yourself. 3. Establish goals with the therapist. 4. It‚Äôs ok to choose a different therapist if you don‚Äôt have a great relationship with the therapist.
What's an academic or work related achievement you're really proud of but can't talk about?	Failing yoga. It‚Äôs the easiest course to take in highschool but i still managed to fail lmao. This is like legit one of my fave accomplishments from highschool. That and like having a great comeback from being hella depressed the year i failed a bunch of shit to gettjng straight a‚Äôs the next year ;p . But ya failing yoga.	I did pretty well last semester. I'm in law school so it's highly, highly competitive. It's all a curve so it all depends how well you do compared to the rest of the classmates vs. just knowing the material. (Everyone in law school knows all the basic material anyway) I don't want to talk about my grades because I know a lot of people didn't do well or as well as they'd hoped. Most people just want to be median but I made it way above median (like top ~20%.) I'm pretty happy about it but I don't want to brag in front of people who didn't do as well. EDIT: Btw, congratulations on graduating early! That's amazing!
What are your tips for getting out of a funk?	The hug is pretty powerful. Hung out with a girl late at night one time. Just cuddled in the cool breeze for hours. ... Couldn't sleep for the next few days afterward, lol !	I read a book once that taught me about the value of going on alone-dates. Take yourself on a date, totally alone. Explore somewhere new, see new things, get a new story you can tell to someone else - because they weren't there to see it. Learn to listen to your own thoughts again. Enjoy space. These 'dates' will always get me out of a funk.
Is a refusal to stop using condoms in a LTR a dealbreaker?	IMO as a woman yeah. It's basically telling me "I don't trust you 100%". Especially as someone who's been on the pill for 10 years or so.	Do you have a time limit? Like, do you envision using condoms for...two years? Five? After marriage? In between when you have kids (if you decide to start a family eventually)? Up until menopause, 20+ years? My boyfriend is more paranoid than I am, and I'm willing to use condoms for a few years. But forever?? That would make me sad.
What notion about yourself would you like to dispell?	I'm not sexist because I act in a manner to which women respond well; and am subsequently successful with them. I didn't make the rules.	Let‚Äôs dispel once and for all with this fiction that I don‚Äôt know what I'm doing. I know exactly what I'm doing.
What are some cute things your SO does that makes you appreciate them more?	He stays downstairs with our baby so I can get some sleep before he goes to bed. Our son is a noisy sleeper so even when he sleeps I sometimes can't if he's close by.	He leaves for work at 6am, I have to get up at 6. Before he leaves he wakes me up with coffee and lies down with me for 5 minutes for cuddles. I love that
What things do you constantly do the 'wrong' way, but work for you?	I haven't studied for any test or quizzes since 3rd grade. I somehow still manage to get B or higher all the time.	Everything gets washed warm and I don't separate my colors/lights/darks. It all turns out clean and nothing is ruined. VOILA.
Is it irrational to not let my man do any sexual stuff with me when family are in the house?	Yeah, it is pretty irrational. Your parents have sex when you are in the house. Unless they have made a rule saying you can't have sex in their house then I don't see what the problem is. At a party I was hosting last year I slunk off upstairs with a girl and about halfway through the act my father opened the door to kick whomever was in my room out, noticed it was me, chuckled and shut the door again.	You are perfectly ok with setting boundaries like this. You just need to be straightforward with him. Literally tell him "I'm not comfortable doing this with other people in the house." He may be frustrated because you have done it before. So you might need to find some other outlet for sex besides "Let's just hang out platonically unless our family isn't home." I would find it frustrating having an up-in-the-air sex life like that. I'm not sure what that solution is or what your options are in that regard.
Who is your favorite rapper?	Macklemore. I can't put down his new album. I'm addicted! Lil dicky is a close second though followed by Kanye, Jason Derulo and anyone who has rapped about butts Edit: when you get down voted and you don't know why! Guys feel free to down vote me but at least let me know why haha	I love Run the Jewels! Idk I just enjoy all of their songs, but I'd recommend listening to Blockubuster night
What embarrassing thing did you do and hope no one will ever find out?	A few years ago I was working as an architect on an 80 year old local state monument and accidentally gave George Washington crossed eyes due to a screw up in the schematics. I had been working late and I was on the verge of finishing the design, or upkeep to be specific, and emailed them before double checking them. Unfortunately, my boss caught on and was furious but tried to contain her rage before she pulled me into her office and, with the fury of God she yells, "In nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h–µll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table!"	I tell people I got into martial arts and boxing because when I was 11 I was beat up by two 16 year old kids. Great sob story, yadda yadda. I leave out the fact that I literally pissed my pants during that incident and the sheer embarrassment of wetting myself has driven me all these years.
Those of you with a 9-5 job, how do you find time in your day to relax/pursue other hobbies?	I and plenty of people work 40+ hours a week and find time for everything. Reading your post you sound kinda whiny. Did you expect adulthood to involve not having to work? People make time for what is important or they make excuses not to.	You might want to try not making so many stops. For me it's real nice to get up, hit the gym with a bag of work clothes, and go straight to work. Going to one, coming home, going to the gym, coming back and then getting on with the night would probably add about an hour of driving
How many guys have gotten in an actual fight with a guy because he was messing with your girlfriend?	This is a weird question. ‚Äùhow many‚Äùimplies you want to know how common it is, but there's no way a bunch of discrete internet answers could demonstrate that.	Once almost, but she started it with this group of guys. She was taking a lot of pictures in one spot so they started snickering at her, so she turns around to them and tells them the pics are not of them so mind their own business. So they mock her going "oooohh scary" so I just say ignore them lets go. Then she gets mad at ME saying why didn't I do anything? I was fucking astounded at the lack of thinking she was using, I was going to fight at least 5 dudes and probably get the shit kicked out of me over pictures. It was stupid selfish shit like that led me to breakup with her later on.
Men, what are you looking forward to the most about becoming a dad one day? And if you don't, why not?	Don't. 55+, haven't made it so far as cohabitating yet. Planet is also more than sufficiently crowded. Certainly also don't want to be dealing with diapers, ... nor having 18+ years of my remaining life sucked up with being obligated to raise a kid. I also don't think raising a teenager is my idea of how to be starting my retirement. And too, kids should't be having parent(s) at high school graduation that are older than most parents ... that's just quite messed up - not to mention they'd also get to have a lot fewer years of their parent(s) even being alive. Oh, yeah, becoming a dad would also mean something went significantly wrong with the vasectomy and the test results after.	I've always wanted a daughter, but as years go on, I feel the urge getting weaker and weaker. I feel like that if I was a father, I'd be a "full-time dad". I'd live, breath and die for my child. I'm not sure I'm willing to become *so* selfless anymore... Maybe one day. My mind is set on having it a lot later, though, preferably in my 40's. And only one child, regardless of sex. I wanna make sure that, at least, I have the experience, money and time to care for them, 'til I'm either dead or they don't need me anymore. I'll be 26 in april, if that matters.
I feel like no one talks about the changes your body REALLY goes through when you get older(even from your teens to your twenties). What has changed for you that you wish you could have told your younger self?	I wish I could tell my younger self to never use liquid foundation (which I did every day for about 15 years). My pores are horrible now that I'm in my 30s.	I thought that when you reached your 20s, your skin cleared up and acne became a thing of the past. That didn't happen. It just changed locations. It went from being a problem on my forehead to being a problem on my cheeks. I finally gave up and went to see a dermatologist who told me that that shift down is very common due to the hormonal changes your body goes through from teens to 20s. I wish I had discovered retinoids and double cleansing sooner. My skin didn't get naturally better in my 20s; I got better at managing it.
What is the hardest part of dating you?	My best friend is a guy, and I don't tolerate any jealously from any potential partners about that. Either accept that we're friends and we're going to do things just the two of us, or gtfo.	I'm very independent and need a lot of alone time. I also care for people but am not very emotionally expressive.
Left my gf of three years after finding out she has been "dating" someone else for a year and a half. Tips on how to focus on moving on?	>Tips on how to focus on moving on? Get back together with her, treat her like a booty call, cheat on her then finally dump her? Not really good for moving on, though, but maybe a bit cathartic. Wouldn't recommend it, though.	Shit dude, that's bad. First thing I'd do is cut contact with her completely. Second thing is surround yourself with friends who'll help you get from day to day. It's a clich√© but things do get easier with time, in the short term just try to distract yourself.
Men, what was the most spectacular way a fellow man hit on a woman and it worked?	In high school, a good friend of mine was working as a waitress at Perkins, when another male friend of ours walked in, calmly superglued his hand to hers, told the manager she was done for the day, tossed dude a $20, took her home and took her V-Card. Just. Like. That.	Once I saw a dude with a little sketchbook ask a girl on the bus if he could draw her. He started chatting her up while drawing and she seemed super into it. He even had these super pale sunglasses (like 10% grey) and a scarf in the middle of summer and shit, couldn't have looked more like a caricature of a deep wannabe if he wanted to. Within about 10 minutes he'd scored her phone number and kept drawing. My favorite part is that she couldn't see his drawing but I could. It was shit. She never asked to see it.
What do you only know about yourself that you only know because someone else has told you?	Damn. My cat is named Asa after a singer. You know what I like Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. The best joker from all of them, and Heath Ledger set standards.	I used to silently mouth what I just said. For example, if someone asked what time it was I'd say, "A quarter passed 7," then they would be weirded out as I mouthed, "A quarter passed seven. I used to second guess myself in social situations as a kid. I fixed it by middle school. Has anyone else done this?
Married ladies who took your spouse's surname...does it suit you? Was it weird at first, having a different name?	I took my husband's name. It doesn't suit me and I don't like it, we're divorcing and I CANNOT WAIT to get my maiden name back. Lesson learned. I will never change it again.	It was odd at first but I got used to it in a few months. I was a bit surprised how quickly I got used to it. Mrs. LastName took me the longest to get used to because that's my mother-in-law, not me. Oh, yeah, it's me too. One of my husband's older relatives always calls me The Lovely Mrs. LastName; I'll have to ask if my mother-in-law is also lovely ;)
What is some advice that sounds good on paper but doesn't really work in real life?	"Just exercise more and eat less to lose weight". Clearly this is just not working for the majority of the population, and I highly doubt the problem is people just not caring because there's all sorts of social pressure and discomfort wrapped up in being overweight.	"Live every day like it's your last." Ummm, if I did that I'd never go to work, have no savings, and would probably never put on pants.
What do you actually do in the shower with your SO?	We just talk and go about our normal shower routines. Sometimes he tries to touch me while I'm washing my body and it drives me nuts. I'm not a monkey or child needing help with my hygiene.	I REALLY enjoy being naked in the shower with my SO without it being sexual. He'll wash my hair, wash my body, give me kisses. I'll wash his body, rub his back. We usually don't have sex in the shower because the angle isn't right, but it's still incredibly Intimate! Then it usually devolves into him spewing water out of his mouth like a fountain and being grossed out by all of my hair on the side of the shower haha I love him.
What have you done to improve your life lately?	NoFap, studying the bible more working out gaming a little less Getting a job and my permit this summer (I'm 16)	Drinking a lot more water. Now I feel like I have wayyy more energy than always feeling tired all the time and my piss is crystal clear.
What type of diet makes your body feel the best?	I feel best doing intermittent fasting and eating basically the opposite of vegan, so I eat nothing all day (though I do drink a cup of coffee with cream in the morning and stuff like Powerade zero throughout the day) and then eat like a whole rotisserie chicken or a pound of sausage for dinner. I don't know how to explain it really, but I hate the way it feels digesting things, so I limit that unpleasant sensation to once a day. Also carbs make me really moody from all the blood sugar spikes and drops, so I mostly avoid those, though I'm not keto-strict.	I took 9 months off drinking alcohol entirely and I'd never felt better. I slept better, my skin looked better, I'd lost a few lbs (not intentional, but hey, I"ll take it), my overall *well being* was better. dunno why I stopped stopping tbh.
Men who got bullied when young, how much do you think the bullying shaped your personality?	Made me tough as nails, but compassionate towards people being bullied. That being said, I don‚Äôt coddle them. I offer them the tools I used to be better and if they choose not to rise above they deserve to be bullied.	I don't trust people. I don't open up to people and am very shy with new people. I'm desperate for people to like me and am a people pleaser. it affected me too much.
Female friends of yours have talked about/know your penis size. How do you feel about it?	My ex actually bragged about my size and performance while drunk when I was present in a bar. It was kinda funny but nothing more. I don't care who knows, it's just a penis.	I have a small penis. My ex told her friends, her friends would make snide comments about it in a "joking way", they brought it up constantly, somehow managed to relate everything I say back to my penis, cut off all contact with them, now have no friends.
What was your favorite romantic gesture or gift from your significant other?	He gave me his grandmother's necklace. Says it all, right? Nope. I gave it back to him today, along with all of his other stuff.	Early in our relationship, a very close friend of mine died suddenly. It was shocking and terrible and I was grieving hard. My BF was unemployed at the time and one day at work I got a text from him asking if I could take a break at work, because he wanted to come by and give me a hug. It just so kind and wonderful. He had remained just as kind and wonderful since then, but that moment early on really struck me and I think of it often.
How comfortable are you with changing your clothes in the same room as your female friend?	No Problem there . I showered naked in Front of my female room mates and in front of 100s of people on beaches all over Europa. What is it with americans and stigmatizing nudity?	i dont assume a regular friend would want to see me naked so out of respect to them i don‚Äôt change in front of em
Ladies who don't like a beard on a man... why?	Probably the same reason a lot of men don't like hairy legs. Some people just like less body hair. I like beards personally. Or preferably that nice bit of stubble some men keep.	I only suggest an actual full blown beard for a man with a weak jaw line. If he has a solid jaw line, that is one of the things that attracts me to a man the most, then you are hiding it behind a bunch of hair. A short beard/five o'clock shadow/scruff is still sexy though and you can see the jaw line.
Do you have a lie or a secret in your life that you feel like you have to dance around? Will you tell us about it?	Nah. Lies take too much effort and I'd rather do fun stuff. I'm also not cool enough to have major deep dark secrets.	The fact that I have such lingering mental issues. It's not that I'm SECRETIVE about it, it's just that I know people would begin to treat me differently if they knew. Mostly my colleagues. It's kinda embarrassing to talk about and they're pick-of-the-crop type guys.
How do you know your dad could kick my dad‚Äôs ass?	Can women play? My dad was a counter-intelligence operative for the US Army. Your dad's ass could already be kicked *and you wouldn't even know it*.	My dad has a twin, so while your dad is sizing up my dad, another my dad would run in from the side and take him out velociraptor-style.
If you and your SO woke up and had switched bodies, what‚Äôs something they would need to know?	Electron microscopy, as that's my job. My boss would be baffled that one of the better technicians is suddenly ass at his job. A whole bunch of programming languages, both for my job and for school, along with Git, Vim, and a couple of other tools that I like to use.	If you try and bend the right knee past 150¬∞ you'll be in pain for weeks. Additionally, holding an athletic position for longer than 5 minutes will cause the knee to fail entirely. Random pricks of pain are sporadic, global, but go away or you get used to it. The right foot cracks when rotated. The joint connecting your left leg to your pelvis is wonky. Your stomach is lying to you. In order to "that" trick you have to mimic a heartbeat rhythm when you flex.
Are there any beauty rituals/ grooming you guys do that are still scared to others because it's "too feminine"?	Not really an answer to your question, but I LOVE using those Bior√© blackhead strips. It's kind of awesome to see the gunk it pulls out of your skin. I used to do them together with my exgirlfriend.	If anyone calls me a faggot for putting lotion on my face and body, I'll force him to suck my dick.
If you could magically look into the future and see that you were never going to find love. What would you change about your life?	To be honest, I'm not sure I'd believe him. I mean, I'm engaged to the woman of my dreams now, so I'm speaking hypothetically. But even in my decades as a lonely virgin with nothing too special about myself and zero prospects, I always just believed everyone finds love eventually.	Would changing anything change that outcome? If not, then I'd probably stop actively looking for a relationship but that's about all I would change.

If you have any questions, please message the moderators through the link on the sidebar.
What do you wish your SO had told you *before* moving in together?	I wish she would have said: "Oh, BTW...you aren't allowed to have a personal opinion and everything you say will be met with either criticism, disbelief or outright opposition. Sex will be controlled by me and when I don't get I want, I'll show you that I'm angry for 2 or 3 days but actually hold my grudge for the rest of my life." Side note: DON'T GET MARRIED GUYS! (And by guys I mean MEN).	"By the way hun, I don't actually use the alarm clock to wake up, I just press the snooze button over and over again until it's five minutes before I have to be out the door."
What have you done for a partner who you thought you'd never do?	Anal with my last ex. Never again. I use to actually swallow and now I can't anymore. It actually makes me very sick.	Clean up blood. I do not do blood. But when the person you love has blood coming out of them, you do what you have to do to make it stop.
Do you have a 'never again' girl?	A feminist. The constant disparaging and belittling of me was not healthy. I was the personification of all the world's evil. Every accomplishment and trait was trivialized, every word had to be carefully chosen.	Yes, my ex. She was selfish and bad at communicating her wants/needs. Instead of addressing them by communicating and working through the issues, she decided cheating was easier. I dumped her shortly after. What sucked was she was my first major relationship and it lasted through my teens and into early college, so for many of our issues I thought,"well, this is how a relationship with women must be." Dating around and meeting new women quickly helped me realize this wasn't the case, thankfully.
AskMen, what story will make us jealous of your relationship with your SO?	Does all the house work Dinner on table every night Will offer BJ randomly Has never said no anytime I've asked for sex Will get coked up with me and watch porn, whilst also blowing me off. Will tongue my arse if I wanted her to. Cracking set of tits, nice legs and beautiful face. Probably more that I don't even notice.	We dont fight, she gives me earth shattering blowjobs 3-4 times a week on top of sex, she looks like a sexy librarian, she is a great cook, she is fun to be around despite being quite reserved, she has the same hobbies as me, and she smells like vanilla and almonds without any deoderant on, and she lets me dote on her like we are highschool love birds. Also she is a nurse so nothing ever grosses her out. We've been together for 8 years and I know it makes me a lucky man.
If forced to wear historical clothing for a week, whqt decade would you choose?	I'm not sure what era they became popular in, but I really do like saris and other Indian dresses. I also like some traditional African clothing and style	Definitely Ancient Egyptian times. Wrap some comfy fabrics around my body, maybe have a boob or two out. Also the jewelry and kohl(?) eyeliner?? Yes please.
How do you "freshen up" quickly before sex?	I take a bath every day and shave everything, so I don't usually need to freshen up before sex. If I'm feeling particularly gross, I'll hop in the tub and use the handheld faucet to wash myself off.	Wet washcloth with warm water. Scrub gently. Pat dry with towel. I used to really like talcum powder, for staving off swamp ass throughout the day. I'd buy it in those little travel-sized containers. So portable and convenient! But of course, now I've seen all the TV lawyer ads, which solemnly promise that Johnson & Johnson is patiently waiting for its chance to use baby powder to make me grow ovaries, which will then grow tumors inside them and kill me. Betting on tap water not to fuck me up *too* badly. But who even knows anymore?
How have askmen helped you?	It's made me feel better about myself compared to all of the whiny, sexist, virgin guys on here who do nothing but whine about how much their lives suck.	I came to this sub from a therapist who suggested that hearing more male voices might help me recover from an assault. You guys are amazing and you have helped me a lot.
What's your more creative date ideas?	I honestly dont even know how to meet interesting women at my own age so I have no idea about proper dates either. 28 single, and at this rate I will die alone.	Last time I went on a first date with a girl, we went to the natural history museum of my city. It seemed like a good idea because there's plenty of things to look at (and to talk about) and since it's a museum, you can't talk out loud so you have to get close to each other. The date went really well and I plan to go back next time I have a date. Of course, it all depends on you both, some would find it really boring.
How do you feel about a girl who laughs during sex?	Not sexy. It's like you're putting this distance in a form of humor between what is happening and your idea of yourself because you can't fully accept it as is. Like you were finding it kinda silly. I prefer the classic, joking-is-over, fierce intensity.	Given your comment for your main post, laughing is fine. personally I'd love a little more humor when I'm getting busy. I'm also pretty sure I've been the chattier one for each girl I've been with. Not sure how I feel about that part.
I'm going back to college at 25, is it creepy to date regular undergrads?	Dude, I'm 34 and I've 'dated' two girls under 20 this year. Who gives a fuck? Especially in an atmosphere where those are the girls who are going to be around you all day. If you're not hurting anyone, do what you want and dont apologize for it.	I went back to college at 25.. I didn't DATE any of my classmates, but we did other neat things and it wasn't weird.
Do you think sexually about all women you spend time with? Do you intuitively form a sexual opinion about all women upon meeting them?	No, not in ANY context. It depends. If the woman is attractive, then yes, no matter how fleeting the interaction, I instantaneously think sexually about her. If the interaction is long and/or recurrent, I will, almost subconsciously, make up my mind about a woman sexually. So long as she is within an age range. If a woman is over 40, only exceptionally beautiful women strike my fancy. If I am in a relationship, the mental activity regarding other women does tend to simmer down as long as the relationship is happy. Generally, I think that my mental activity regarding women and sex is hardwired and subconscious. When it comes to particularly attractive women, it bubbles up, and it is difficult to not think about how badly I want them.	There are two different things here; noticing whether a woman is attractive or not, and actively thinking about her sexually (like fantasizing about her, or even a quick thought of "wow, I'd like to fuck her"). Seeing a woman and noticing whether she's attractive just seems natural and automatic. Seeing her and *not* noticing whether she's attractive is about as alien to me as going outside and *not* noticing whether it's raining or not, meaning that it's pretty rare. Actively thinking about women sexually is different. It's an actual action that you do, not simply something that you passively notice. It's going to happen for fewer women (depending on their attractiveness, what other things are occupying your mind, whether you're single, etc.).
Gay men of AM, how do you feel browsing this sub?	Gay men are men too. So why should they feel left out. There was a comedian that said that gay men are more man than straight men, because I don't know any straight men that would dare take one up the tailpipe (they probably exist though). Frankly it scares me, so good on you bro's	I don't feel alienated or left out, from what i see on askgaybros a lot of problem are relatable. One thing i find funny is guys saying they don't understand women or that women are too complicated, i feel like it's more general, women and men are complicated. I also like to see how on some topics straight men are really picky while gay dudes doesn't give a shit. For example, sexual partners numbers, it's a recurring issue here while for gays it's pretty rare, most don't care from what i've seen.
Adult Men/Dads, How do you handle it all without going insane?	Its funny you mention Ukraine and Isis. I live in Israel. This past summer was wild. I live close to Syria and Lebanon and Hizbollah is threatening to start war in the North soon. Im in rocket range. We have gas masks in case of a chemical attack. But me and my wife are pretty chilled about the whole situation. We trust in God. It sort of comes with living in Israel. i was also in Ukraine 2 weeks ago and nothing happened to me. Just chill. Besides that - i pray, meditate,smoke cigarettes and makes lots of music. edit- why downvotes?	Plan everything. Try "outsourcing" as much things as you can - hire a cleaning lady, hire someone to do yard work, don't fix the car yourself take it to the mechanic, etc. When I stopped doing shit myself it was magic. I lost out on some money, but I gained a ton of time that just didn't exist before.
What should everyone know about partying?	The usual guideline for buying drinks for a party is to reserve two drinks per person for the first hour, and one drink per person for every hour after that. That's a good baseline, if you don't know your tolerances. I also like to stop drinking at least ten hours before I plan to wake up, and go to bed with an ibuprofen, to prevent hangovers.	Drink but know your limits. After the evening drink at least 5 cups of water, maybe more since hangover is not really fun. When you dance just don't give a shit about what you look like, imagine you are in an empty room, like another poster said focus on having fun not looking like you are having fun.
What's the best decision you've made in the last 30 days?	I agreed to participate in bodybuilding competition with my brother for next summer and the SO is down to go through the experience with me. Works out (pun unintended) because SO and I are planning to be a bit more fit for our halloween costumes, since it's bulking time it works out with the holiday feasting, and then by next summer we'll have beach bodies. Plus, it's actually giving me a goal to work towards in the gym instead of the usual lifts and cardio that I normally do just to stay in shape.	Ended things with an Ex of 2 years. She contracted HSV-2 while we were getting back together, slept with me, blamed me for giving it to her, told her family, emotionally manipulated me to stay with her, then told me she'd commit suicide if we didn't get back together. Tested negative, cut her out and blocked her from social media and ignored calls. Told her mother of her contemplating self harm. Talking to a much nicer, less scarier girl. I'm so happy and as are my friends who saw this a mile away. Definitely dodged a bullet.
Whenever I'm dating a woman, I usually end up sacrificing my own happiness to make her happy. Anybody else do that? Why do we do this??	As a man put your happiness first. No one else will. Now it just so happens that it makes us happy to have our SOs happy. However a man who rushes around kissing her ass and saying "happy wife happy life" MIGHT be the sorta bitch of a man that no woman can respect. Women want a dynamic and strong man who has a mission in life beyond them.	Every relationship involves sacrifice. I sacrifice my happiness for my wife all the time. She sacrifices hers for me. This is the nature of human interaction. It's an issue when you sacrifice everything and you're the only one doing the sacrificing. Don't do that. However, make sure your eyes are open and can see when she's giving things up for you. A lot of people only notice their own losses.
Men who thought they were never going to find love and eventually found it, how did it happen?	I'll probably be downvoted for this comment but... I honestly feel like some of these stories are Tall Tales from the basement.	Short guy, lousy athlete, skin trouble, workaholic. Woman at client site got stuck waiting to lock the door when I worked late. We got to talking, sometimes grabbed dinner after work, she was interested in the project I was doing. She made me laugh. I talked about places I'd traveled to. We weren't trying to impress each other, but we enjoyed talking and hanging out. We're married, together almost 30 years. She's still my best friend.
What is the most uncomfortable situation have you ever been put in- by a guy? Any kind of unwanted flirtation- or something of that nature?	I once shook a hand of a male distant friend of mine during high school. He stopped and slowly felt up the palm of my hand asking me as to how do I make my hands so soft. Another male distant friend during high school (As I was wearing a bag/backpack) asked if he could put his hand on my back as we were walking like a couple without the hand dropping down to my ass. I don't entirely remember but I think it was just one of those moves to stick some shit on my back.	Not flirtation but definitely beyond uncomfortable. Once I was sitting on the outside patio of a coffee shop studying and an older man (50s?) came and sat at the table right next to me. I noticed him staring at me but just ignored him. Not just glances, a straight up staring. Five minutes after he sat down I noticed some fidgeting out of the corner of my eye and took a quick glance. Not only was this man still staring, he straight up starting playing with himself...in public...in broad daylight...5 feet away from me.
How often do you get "girlfriend-zoned", and what is it like?	The term friend-zone and girlfriend-zone is pathetic. People just need to grow up and realize not every girl wants to date you and not every guy wants to date you.	I've had it happen once, it made me feel like crap. I think I'm an awesome friend, and I never lead anyone on. Why was my friendship not enough? I value my friends, I value those close friendships, I expect others to do the same. Then he started moping about how I wasn't interested in him, which made me feel like a bad person. I was in the position of constantly having to shoot down his advances because he was repeatedly ignoring me saying I wasn't interested, then I was the bad person for hurting him. In the end, I decided he wasn't someone worth being friends with.

What are some Nice Guy‚Ñ¢ anthem songs?	Would "Blurred Lines" be a good fit here? The whole concept of 'man knows best' is interwoven through the whole song.	The What Makes You Beautiful song by One Direction popped into my head. "Don't need make-up, to cover up, being the way you are is enough." "You don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful." There isn't much more to the lyrics, but this song rubbed me the wrong way. What if I know I'm beautiful? Does that make me ugly?
Men, what do you want to get off of your chest?	The sarcastic, ironic humor of my generation has been weaponized and I am sorry to you younger people. It has bred legitimate assholes. We were just playing at it because we knew it was awful. Somewhere it got poisoned. We all lost something when this happened. I am sorry for my part in not seeing the signs and continuing to dispense ironically prejudiced humor in a now post-irony climate.	Argh. Fuck this heat! I'm sweating my bollocks off and tomorrow I'm going in to a hot office with no aircon to sweat balls all day. Yay me.
Guys who went from being unnoticed by women to being extremely noticed - what did you change?	Be social! Just talk to people. Walk with your head up and your shoulders back. Dress well. Get a real haircut and fix your hair. Every. Day.	I mean I'm not *extremely* noticed, but women do notice me now, I basically started caring for how I look, my posture (back straight chest out head UP) and I become more confident with experience.
If a girl took sexual advantage of me when I was extremely drunk, am I a rape victim?	You would be in court, if not jail, right now with your reputation in tatters if the roles were reversed here, much like the bloke who had fully consensual sex with the mattress-carrying girl in the USA. So I'd say you are a rape victim here and should seek vindication in whatever ways possible.	For me, it very much depends on how capable and lucid you were at the time. If someone has sex with you and you were too physically too drunk to prevent it happening, then yes, you have every right to describe it as rape. That's very different than where you choose to have sex in an inappropriate situation because you're inebriated and then feel uncomfortable about it later (even if the other person is stone sober and a manipulative sleazeball). Only you can really know where you fall on that scale.
Pet owners in relationships: who do you greet first, your pet or your SO?	Depends who greets me at the door first. Usually it's Luna the cat, because the sound of my car horn usually means I come inside and feed her, but the SO has been there a few times too.	If you have a dog, you don't have a choice in the matter. They make sure to get to you first.
Guys, do you need to be needed?	No, we're heartless creatures and don't deserve to be needed. Does your father want to be needed when you were growing up? Does your mother want to be needed when you were growing up? We are humans too, obviously you don't care about the guy if you don't want to need him, this is the whole point of the relationship...	Just an FYI, but whenever it seems like things aren't going well (date life) because of things that aren't really problems (your self sufficiency), it's probably a good sign that your own delusion is stopping you from seeing the real problem. I highly doubt that people are dumping you because you're *not* a burden on them. It's probably something else you're not aware of and/or admitting, or it could just be the competition in your environment is offering up a better deal for these particular dudes.
Do you ever feel like you're living your life to be Instagram worthy? As in, you want to participate in activities that show you have an active social life? How do you combat this?	No. I would like to get my selfie game back, though. My girl friends all post amazing selfies all the time and they're so gorgeous but I just can't be arsed to take the time to snap 100 photos of my fucking mug until I produce something decent.	I deleted most of my social media accounts. "Out of sight, out of mind", as they say. Never looked back.
Men who are thick in the head when it comes to picking up hints from women, what are your stories?	Men are not thick when it comes to women's "hints". Women are simply being soft and vague so that, if rejected, they have deniability. This keeps them away from the negative emotions of being rejected. It's dishonest, manipulative and a form of lying. Any girl who does this should be immediately rejected if detected, and then given a plain, frank talk about why this is a shitty thing to do when they'd NEVER put up with it if men were doing it. Come on, girls, BE the equals you claim you are. This position is objectively an equal one, and to reject or oppose it makes you a sexist. Cue butthurt, silent downvotes and idiotic, whiny comments from losers who don't get it...	wearing a santa costume at a house party Girl: You know what i want for christmas? Me(verydrunk): What? Girl: Sex. Me(stillverydrunk): aight. *walks away*
How did you prepare for marriage?	Gonna go a different way, and say: by not cohabitating without commitment. Marriage, to me, is a different pair\-bond than dating/ living together, and I wanted to differentiate marriage from dating, publicly and emotionally. I don't buy the idea that you need to live with someone to know them, so when I met my now\-husband and realized we are compatible as roommates, financial partners, friends, romantically, we just talked about our expectations regarding everything, ESPECIALLY money and roommate stuff	I think the most helpful thing was discussing our values behind the recommended premarital topics - money, kids, household duties, etc. For example, my husband values spending money on hobbies much more than I do. Understanding his value for this, rather than just the budget, has been very helpful in marriage. Budgets and expectations can change, but learning how to articulate value is so important. Like some posters, we didn't live together before marriage. I understand why some people want to do this! However, I think it helped my husband and I separate the difference between dating and marriage and intentionally restructure our lives once we made the marriage commitment.
Would it bother you if your girlfriend let it slip that her last boyfriend was very well endowed?	That would be like your girlfriend being upset with you because your ex had way larger breasts than her. If it bothers you, so be it. But it's not a thought worth vocalizing because absolutely nothing fruitful can come from that conversation/argument.	Yes, of course. I am well endowed myself, so I have a high threshold for getting insecure about it. But no matter how big or small you are, a statement like that obviously implies that he was bigger. I would bet most girls wouldn‚Äôt love it if their boyfriend "let it slip" that his last girlfriend had really spectacular tits. "Oh, yours are great too, honey. Hey, I‚Äôm with you, right? So obviously I like your tits. Really, really, really gorgeous tits aren‚Äôt the most important thing to me. What matters is that the girl knows how to use them!"
Are there any questions that you've wanted to ask someone of a particular ethnicity (that isn't your own), but haven't been able to?	Why do black women criticize other black women who get weaves saying they are whitewashed? Why do lots of black people call other fellow blacks "Whitewashed" if they speak properly and aim to have a nice job and nice life? Why so many single moms in the black community? Only asking questions to people who have seen the aforementioned things happen, no I am not generalizing I have just seen it happen lots of times to deduce it was not an isolated case and I wanted to know. European here, so I get my information from the internet. Thanks :D	YES and it's a really dumb one and I don't know how to ask it without sounding like a goddamn racist, but here goes: I'm a lawyer and I have noticed that black men and women tend to wear formal hats more often than any other given ethnicity. Particularly men. I've wondered why wearing hats with suits has become more and more uncommon (to the point where when I see a white guy in a suit and a hat my knee-jerk reaction is UGH DOUCHE) in the "white world" but that it has continued to be fashionable and appropriate in the black community. I've never known how to ask that without saying something utterly idiotic. Not sure I accomplished it here. To be clear, I have absolutely no objection to black men dressing however they damn well please. I just always wondered if there was a historical or sartorial significance.
Men of Reddit, what do women seem to think you don‚Äôt care about but in reality, you actually DO?	Makeup. Please wear makeup. If you show up to a date with no makeup, it's just telling me you don't give a fuck. I put my best look out there, and you didn't.	How you treat me You may think we don't notice all the subtleties and nuances, but we do, your actions speak volumes about you as a long term partner. If we feel like we're always the bad guy, and nothing we do is good enough, we're going to leave, simple as that. Reason I say this is because some people seem to think as long as the sex it's fine right? No, the sex can feel empty and hollow, almost soul crushing when you feel like the person is just using it as bait or to keep you around.
Ladies of Reddit, have you ever felt you were a ‚Äúlate bloomer‚Äù on something a women of your age should have down by (makeup, romance, etc)?	Um, yes? Before this year, I hadn't worn a dress (excluding when I was 4), done any makeup, worn jewelry, gone on a date (though I did have a serious relationship), done *anything* most women have done. But I'm catching up as much as I can.	I didn't have my first date until 33. I didn't learn how to do my hair until 32. I didn't learn how to do make-up, or dress in a flattering way, or any of those really girly things, until then, really. There's a correlation, I'm sure. Prior to that, I lived in books and not the real world. Sometimes I miss those times.
What‚Äôs something that most female writers get wrong about writing male characters?	Have you read or seen handmaids tale, this is not what men are like but extremist feminists would like to think that way. I love my mother my sister my wife my friends.	I don‚Äôt think they understand modern-day boys. Bullies aren‚Äôt going around like, ‚ÄúGive me your much money and meet me at the bike rack at 4:00. You‚Äôre dead meat!‚Äù I grew up on the 90‚Äôs and 00‚Äôs. Boy bullies nowadays are just dicks. Like they won‚Äôt fight you, they‚Äôll just be a dick to you 24/7. You kind of wish you could just knock them out and it will be over, but when you try something like that, you‚Äôre the one who gets in trouble.
How did your parents marriage affect your views on marriage?	At some point around my birth, they randomly fell out of love and Dad began cheating. I don't want to get married. People change, and there is nothing romantic about a legal contract	I learned that I will never go for an arranged marriage, and will instead search for a partner that I truly love and adore myself. I also learned that compromise is key- all arguments between my parents don't end sooner than they should because neither of them will ever admit they can be wrong. Having grown up with a verbally and emotionally abusive mother, I'm so scared to form an emotional attachment to a woman. I grew up with 18 years of being told I was never, ever, ever good enough no matter what I achieved, and that I will always be singled out for what I failed to achieve instead. That I'm nothing more than a distracted idiot who will end up homeless on the streets. :(
What's it like as a kid to hear that you're unequal to tasks that are 'for men'?	I just realized I was better for some tasks than others. My brother wouldn't be able to help my mom with sewing- because he's uninterested and wouldn't enjoy it. Similarly I didn't want to help my dad with yard work. Oncw when we were cutting firewood, I wanted to help and my dad said I wasn't strong enough but let me try. Guess what, I wasn't and let my brother go at it. I never saw it as misogyny but that we are best suited for different things.	I was 4 and told my grandfather I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up. He told me women could only be nurses or teachers. I became an engineer and got a job at NASA and married a (male) teacher. :) But how did it make me feel? That my grandfather was a moron.
What's your funniest sex story?	I accidentally hit the wrong button on my Hitachi, bumped it up two levels and switched it to pulses instead of steady vibrations while I was giving head. I basically fell over and would have hit my head on the headboard but for his quick grab. And then I was exhausted -_- ...	Once I was having sex with this dude, it was all going below averagely until he started shouting "YES RUSSEL SHE'S LOVING IT! YEAH YEAH SHE. IS. LOVING. IT. UH UH UH UH! YOU DA MAN! SHE'S GETTING SO NAILED, SHE LOVES IT!!!!" No I was not loving it, and I was trying to fight back laughter as he flopped around on top of me cheering himself on. I told him to stop and get out of my house because I thought someone was coming home.
What do women do that they think is romantic, but men actually find cringey?	Ex I was dating bought me a rose once. Got mad when I let it die cause I forgot to put it in water.	I dated someone who was more interested in sharing with others that we were in a relationship than actually being present in the relationship. Like an over exaggeration of our romance. Selfies galore, it was exhausting. I think what did it for me was when I took her out to enjoy a sunset, she snapped a "perfect" picture and decided she wanted to go. The sunset was a fluid 30 minute event, how are you satisfied with a moment's snapshot?
Men of Reddit, as the technology advances, would you ever consider buying a Robot Sex-Doll? Why or why not? Do you have any reservations about them?	To me, sex is awesome because: -I'm giving pleasure to a girl I like/love -I'm getting validation that I'm desirable from a girl I like/love -I'm sharing a very intimate moment with a girl I like/love -It feels nice. Three of these things require another person. The last one by itself is achievable by masturbating. So no, I'm not gonna spend a thousand bucks on a big and awkward fleshlight.	I think about the after jerking shame and how it would increase exponentially if I was staring at a robot filled with my cum.
What were you taught as a little girl that you will never teach your own daughter?	You are a lady which means you know your place.. Never will i allow my daughter to feel because of her sex she has to hold her tounge and be a mother at a young age (cook and clean) that its a life skill that is nessecary. And college is a privelage. Education will be a expectation for my daughters. They will be smart enough to be succeful with their brains not becuase of who they get pregnant by.	I remember my mother making lots of negative comments on other women's appearances, and she still does. I want to be conscious of what I say and how it might impact my daughter, if/when I have one.
What's the meanest thing you've done that you DON'T regret doing?	This girl I knew for some time came to hang out. A virgin at the time, I decided that she‚Äôd be the one to lose it too. Turns out she was a wet towel in bed. Just laid there and took it. No enthusiasm or emotion what so ever. The next morning I told her I had got called into work. Walked her out of my apartment, said goodbye, got in my car, drove around the block, saw that she left, and went back inside. Never spoke to her again.	My old roommate moved out without warning and paying rent so I got her car towed when she was moving. She moved about an hour away so while she was gone with the uhaul, her car was towed away from my home
Men of Reddit, did you ever hit a woman?	I'm not a man, but I've been hit by a man before. I was out clubbing with friends and someone accidentally pushed me forward (it was packed in the club and I'm tiny so naturally I went flying) into the back of this guy's friend and made her spill her drink. Then the guy turned around and started yelling at me so naturally I tried to walk away and I felt his fist collide with the back of my head and found myself on the floor again. It probably would have hurt more if I'd been sober.	Oh yeah, my sister and I used to beat the shit out of each other. She split my whole fucking head open one time with a fisher price xylophone, and I retaliated with a grand slam upside her dome with a wiffle ball bat.
Men of Reddit, what's bothering you?	My SO [F/19] has strict and conservative parents. I want that to change so we don't have to keep hiding.	My SO argues about everything to get her way, and I'm annoyed that I'm going to have to fight back over stupid shit so that I can have a say about anything.
Mixed race ladies, what are your unique experiences in regards to your ethnicity/race?	I'm tan, and everybody jokingly called me Mexican in school. Honestly I didn't really remember having a problem with it, except maybe sometimes when it might have been getting old or derogatory. And airport security always gets me, even would separate me from my white mother sometimes. I'm french actually, and strangely whenever somebody would remark about the french I'd take it a little personal... Just a fun fact.	When I was younger I definitely looked hispanic (my family is from Cuba) and had an accent to match. I grew up in a hispanic area so I never really thought about it. But then I moved to another country when I was 19. Every time I flew, US security would question and search me, and occasionally pull me aside to another room for further questions. The first time I flew with my husband (as pastey white as they come), was the first time I flew without all that. I never thought of myself as anything other than a typical white American before then. Now I live where it's cold, I lost my tan, and most of my accent, so now people are surprised to hear I am hispanic.
What's something that's super popular in your area, but basically unheard of in the rest of the world?	I don‚Äôt know that I have anything for my area. Maybe Starbucks or Seattle‚Äôs Best Coffee. They‚Äôre basically on every street corner and in every grocery store. Part of being in their home state. I‚Äôve been to places that don‚Äôt have Starbucks or SB, only Dunkin Donuts, which pales in comparison. Or Jones Soda. Do other places have Jones Soda? And Voodoo Donuts. I know there‚Äôs one in Texas somewhere. But they‚Äôre pretty much only a PNW/Portland thing.	Not in a hipster way but Yorkshire puddings and crumpets. I honestly thought that any country that ate roast dinners on a Sunday would have Yorkshire puddings. Until I went to a carvery with some American friends and saw the "WTF?!" look on their faces. I think other places do crumpets but I'm not sure if they love them the same way we do. The excitement when "giant crumpets" were released by Warburtons was too real.
Hetero men: how do you feel about the expectation to buy your SO an engagement ring?	I find it ironic and that women still demand certain traditions while running away from most others while crying oppression.	I think they're expensive and fairly pointless trinkets, but my wife likes them so I buy them. I'm sure she buys all kinds of crap for me that she considers equally silly.
What is your weirdest dealbreaker?	I'm not sure if this is necessarily weird, but I can't date someone who doesn't have a degree. I understand college isn't for everyone, but I'm not someone who wants to date a college isn't for everyone type of person.	brought someone to an indian restaurant and they called the waitress over to ask for ketchup, because he said he needed ketchup in his rice. was surprised an indian restaurant had no ketchup. kept complaining that they had no ketchup. BYE...
Any adult women out there willing to admit they were one of the ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù in high school? If so, how do you feel about that now, looking back?	I was definitely a mean girl growing up. I was the girl who was nice in your face and talk shit about you and make fun of people with my friends. I don‚Äôt even think it was coming from an insecure place, it was just something my friends and I did to make each other laugh at others expense. Even now I sometimes find myself being that petty mean girl always laughing at someone. I try to stop myself but I feel no way about it! I hate to say it I don‚Äôt feel bad, that was just the page I was on! My friends and I just love to laugh!	In middle school there was this girl who was an outcast that no one ever hung out with or extended friendship to. Looking back, I did not say anything when others would look down at her. I was picked on a bit during that time but people still hung out with me so instead of putting myself out there I just let it happen. I've recently facebook stalked her and she seems happy and normal so I'm pretty sure it was middle school pettiness that was the issue, not her. I still feel a bit guilty sometimes thinking about how lonely it must have been back then... Especially since I know how it feels.
Men who lost sexual desire for their partner then gained it back, what happened?	Hey may also just be asexual. I know in all the relationships I've had I feigned enjoying sex early on because I had the mindset that I'm a guy, I have to want sex, that's how it is. But I can't keep doing that and it eventually comes out, could be the case here as well.	I wanted to just post "Alcohol" from the title but your post deserves more Sneaking about is fun until it isn't Parents in the house can be a real passion killer. Same with kids, just because they are there. Why don't you book a hotel room for the night, i used to do this where there was a pub (aka bar) next to it. Few drinks, back to the room and voila! The reason for the bar was so it wasn't just a go here, have sex, go home as that could create pressure. A night away from normality usually works wonders.
So I [25M] have been asked 3 times in 12 hours to hang out with a coworker [18F] outside of work, how do I tell her nicely that I don't think we should be hanging out outside of work and still keep things good in the work place?	First, number 1, foremost... contact HR, and tell them you've been asked out by a coworker three times, and you will be turning her down. Do not file a complaint, and inform them that no action needs to be taken, you just want this in your record, in case things go south (and they can go South). Second, tell her that you don't want to mix your personal and business life. If she loses her mind about it, and starts getting ugly, then you've got the note in your HR file that this was what happened, and these were the steps you intended to take. If things go back to normal, then no harm no foul.	Folks are saying here to just tell her straight up and they're right... but you specifically asked about also keeping things at work good too. The fact is... it might not be possible. Saying no to her is obviously the right thing to do, but she may or may not take it well. Those are the breaks. It might blow over as no big deal at all, or she might get butthurt. We don't know you or her, so there's no way to tell. Do your best to be polite and considerate, and then hope for the best.
What's a subtly hot way of letting him see me naked for the first time?	Have you tried opening your mouth like an adult and just telling him what you want and what you're comfortable with and having a conversation about your relationship and the speed you want to take things at? I know it's a crazy idea, but it's one of those ideas that is so crazy it might just work.	Hey "Johnny," can you come here for a sec? *Wait for him to enter your room.* *Drop the bathrobe from your shoulders.* Does my birthday suit still fit me? *Laugh*
Have you ever backed out of sex with a new person at the last second? What caused it?	She asked me to fist her. I was just like nope not gonna stick my dick in that grand canyon.	We were both really drunk. I nibbled at her neck, or i'd move my hands around, or whatever, and would say, "no, you neeeeeed to stop that", or just "stop", but in a playful way. Every time I stopped she said, "why'd you stop? keep going". It was really uncomfortable for me. After the third or fourth time she did that, I said I can't do it, and I asked her to leave.
What may be some things you girls see as sexist, while we, men, may not be realising it is?	ITT: Everything a man does that a woman doesn't like is sexist... Bullshit. I'm a woman and to be quite honest, some of these suggestions of sexism are hilarious. Oh a guy offers help with something he thinks is heavy = sexist. Someone calls a woman a girl = sexist. No wonder some men get confused.	As an example, I was waiting in line (for over an hour) to exchange a cable box a few weeks ago. I was holding the cable box under one arm, and was told about _three_ times by different men that I should put it down so it didn't get heavy for me. Not one of those men felt the need to tell men who were holding the exact same cable box that they should do the same. I had to keep telling them I was fine holding it. I mean, the thing weighed like, a whopping 7 pounds. I think things like this happen a lot without people thinking twice about it. Also, assuming that a woman is not legitimately upset about something and automatically blaming her "attitude" on PMS.
