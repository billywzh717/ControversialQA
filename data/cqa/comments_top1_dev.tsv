Men who have had the "I have a boyfriend" line pulled on you when you weren't remotely interested in the girl, how'd it go?	Me: "Hi, you are really cute and I'd love to get to know you" Her: "Aww you're so sweet but I have a boyfriend" Me: "Lucky guy! Enjoy each other".	"is anybody using this stool?" "I have a boyfriend!!" "Is he using this stool? I'd like to sit with my wife"
Opening the door to girlfriend in lingerie - yay or nay?	A healthy man will always take sex over rest. He might want a shower first though after traveling. Answer the door in the towel and offer to take a shower with him or some shit. That sounds good to me.	It's a great idea, just make sure he is coming home alone (i.e. his aunt isn't coming by for a surprise visit)
Just chased down a lady who hit my car, what is your most ridiculous car accident story?	A few hours ago I barely grazed this dudes car. I guess he noticed because a few mins later he was LITERALLY CHASING ME DOWN FOR MILES. Geez, what happened to chivalry, aren’t you men supposed to show some respect to us women?	I got rear-ended, pulled over, and the guy who hit me pulled over. The first thing he says was "It's not my fault. My brakes don't work." Whatttttt
How do I get over my failure in my 20s?	I don't think it's actually you that wants to sleep with lots of women. It's your ego. But you won't believe me. And it's ok, I totally understand that. You won't change your mind just because of my comment. One way to change your mind is to actually fuck those dozens of women and realize that the emptiness inside didn't go away, that you're still not happy. The other way is psychological self-awareness you can achieve by introspection, psychotherapy, getting rid of your ego, meditation and learning about Buddhism. I'm not telling you to become a Tibetan monk. But I encourage you to get into Taoism, Buddhism and Zen. You can start with book "Tao of Pooh" by Benjamin Hoff	You need to find out why not sleeping with a lot of people means being a failure. That's a pretty shitty scale to judge your success on.
How long had you and your SO been together before you said "I love you"?	I totally worked it out of him. I had been feeling that way for a while. We had been together for 4 or so months at that point. We spent the night just talking and being cute and then when we went to bed I told him, "I can't believe how much I've fallen for you." And then he said "I love you" and then I said it back. Anyway, getting married in September.	3 months. He said it first. On my birthday. We were drunk. I said it back. Then the next morning when we were sober he said it again.
In retrospect, what were the little signs that your partner was falling in love with you, or you with them?	With my husband it was stuff like holding hands or sending me extra cute texts. With my boyfriend it was the addition of hand holding and forehead kissing during our normal kinky sex.	I feel him kissing my forehead/shoulder/back of my head, in the middle of the night, when he thinks I'm 100% asleep
What's the greatest compliment a woman has ever given you?	>"stevenson123 is a straight up 10/10 in everything. He's attractive, smart, successful, a great guy. A straight up 10. How could anyone not want that?" /r/cringe a little. I wouldn't consider this to be a huge compliment. I'd rather be known as an asshole/dick who has dated some/one of those hot friends, than the 'greatest and nicest guy IN THE WORLD' who none of them wants to date. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwxZzTjgr9U , Here's my boy Adam Carolla explaining it in much better terms than I can/could.	I was hanging out with a friend and she whispered in my ear "You're who I think about when I masterbate." I have never felt more alive.
I just found out I'm pregnant. What was your experience with getting an abortion?	I haven't had an abortion but i'm not against it. I hope you make the right decision for yourself, whatever it may be. If you are taking the abortion, you are still pro life. You are pro YOUR life, which is equal to the clump of cells in your body. Now as selfish as it sounds, having children is selfish no matter what. Kids never ask to be born so to make a choice in this will always be a selfish one. You will get through this, talk to someone you trust and make sure you have at least 1 person to support you, maybe to discuss this with, someone that can be as neutral as possible and knows you and your life. Good luck!	Hey -- I've never had an abortion, but FYI I used to be an abortion counsellor at a feminist health clinic and abortion provider. Happy to answer any questions you may have regarding what I learned from my clients.
What are you jealous of in other women?	Mod note: Locked due to rampant rule-breaking. Thank you to those who participated within the rules. Please continue to report all rule-breaking.

What is something that you've done to a woman that would make you mad if someone did the same to your daughter?	Pulled her hair, choked her, spanked her, fucked her throat, fucked her in the ass, fucked another woman while she watched and diddled herself.... the list just goes on	She said I love you. I said it back because I "had to", despite planning to break up with her. It's almost 2 years ago now, and I still hate myself for that.
Would you be offended if your SO said they didn't want your genes in their future children?	If I had a SO that said that to me, I would be beyond livid. It is an extremely insulting thing to say. In your specific case, she might have a point. However, I think that, with anxiety and depressive disorders, a lot of it involves the environment a child is raised in. If you two are emotionally stable enough to raise adoptive children in a stable, loving family, then biological children shouldn't be too much of an issue.	I think she was making a small joke in passing. Not being serious. But, yes, I would be deeply offended if someone told me they thought I was so flawed that I should not pass on my genes.
How does ordering alcohol at the bar work?	You pull out your dick and start slapping it on the counter while maintaining eye contact with the person to your right.	Think of a bar like a restaurant. Just tell them what you want. If you want a certain beer say the name of beer. Same thing for harder alcohol. You can be generic and say rum and coke but they'll usually give you whatever their house rum or whiskey (in the case of whiskey and coke) so there you may want to specify as well unless you don't care about the brand.
How do you feel about revealing your age publicly? To what extent is the year of one's birth a private matter?	I'm 33 and I don't care who knows. The only thing is, I don't go around publishing my birthday online because I don't really want scammers to get a hold of it. But beyond that, I don't care if friends/family/acquaintances/whoever know my age. I don't even care personally how old I am, which is why when someone asks me, I usually have to stop and figure it out, lol. I think I stopped keeping track of birthdays around 25? Basically, once I was old enough to drink and have cheaper car insurance, I totally stopped caring about age.	I tell folks I am 15 years older than I really am but I moisturize. Then they tell me how great I look.
What house rules has your pet created?	My dogs live outside in our big, fenced in back yard, but occasionally we let them come in, get a bath, and be the lazy creatures they were meant to be, but in air conditioning. They say that toilet seats can't be closed because they'll just open them anyway. They also say that it is definitely not bedtime until they have eaten every since thing that resembles food that is not in the fridge or out of reach. (No worries, there's nothing toxic that they can get to, especially because I have 2 kids.)	Nut butter is to be shared. No exceptions. If the dog loses a toy under furniture, this is the fault of whatever human is closest. This human should fix their error and retrieve the toy. If pets are not given in a timely fashion, expect increasing nudges and wiggles until dog floof is all you can see and thus pet. All clothes come standard with hair during shedding season.
When it comes to dating, what do you think is the biggest misconception men have about what it's like to be a single woman?	The " Why are you not in a relationship?! You're great!" *women don't have to be in a relationship throughout their lives* Some are single because they *wanna* be.	That we have orbiting men around us all the time and that we aren't rejected. My friends have had men 'ghost' on them frequently after what they felt was a great, successful date. This ignores women who appear unapproachable, unattractive women, or even average/attractive women who aren't social butterflies.
When is the best time to tell people I'm 4'10 on online dating and why?	I'm legally a midget in your profile is a pretty funny way to start things off. Women are more attracted to men who can laugh at themselves. But I'm sorry for your loss. #tallboysquad	Putting it on your profile bio would be the best place. That way you save yourself from being ghosted when they ask your height, or completely shut down.
What is your biggest breakup regret? Why did you break up with him/her? Why do you regret it?	I went on a few dates with a guy who was super sweet, shy and funny. We had a great time together our first couple of dates, but he had a nervous habit of asking REALLY dumb questions (and also he let me pay for stuff, but I'm only annoyed by that because I'm an asshole). I blew him off after the third date using that as an excuse, but I think really I was just afraid of getting closer to him. This was a few years ago and I still regret it sometimes. Looked him up a few months ago and he moved to a different state. C'est la vie.	Breaking up because of school. We planned on getting back together after he was done with school, and I planned on talking to him during summer break. I never saw him or spoke to him again, though, because he died just before the semester ended. 12 years of friendship, 8 years of dating. It seemed like a good decision, and I missed him, but we were doing pretty well. And then I got a call from one of our mutual friends. He told me to sit down, and he gave me the news. It might have been the right decision at the time, but I regret not calling him, texting him, telling him the whole thing was stupid and that I missed him too much during those 9 months before he died.
What's something women do that's essentially shooting themselves in the foot when trying to meet guys?	Being overly interested in me. Sorry, there was someone else at the table too. At least try to act like we were there as three people not 2 + 1. Did I even look like I was interested? You're nice enough, but no.	Not show signs of interest. A conversation can be just that; a platonic conversation. To actually show interest and make the guy know you are into him is another point.
What's that one super embarrassing thing you did that keeps you up at 1am cringing about it years later?	I won best dressed at prom.. I said thank you all for voting for me because I was so shocked that my class did that and I was very unpopular then and spoke to no one and the "late chick" during my school days. Edit: I would like to make it clear that I was an awkward teenager and didn't expect this and didn't know what to say and I had said it as though I'm the prettiest girl in the world because I do not know what to say at that moment. I still cringe at this moment.	I was a new boss and had to fire an employee for the first time. She packed her bag, cleaned out her desk and I followed her to the door. And I said ... "See you later". It was just a habit. The way she looked at me ... I still cringe so hard thinking about it.
For those who have stopped wearing make-up or greatly reduced its use, what made you call it quits/reduce, and how has the change affected the way people view or treat you?	I only wear eye liner, mascara, and cover up literally. And people still compliment me on how it makes me look nice. So you don't really need a lot to look good :)	Honestly I just got lazy and prefer the 15 extra minutes I can sleep in before work. I only put on makeup when I'm getting together with my friends or going out on the weekends or at nights with my SO. No one treats me differently about it. At work it's more about the quality of my projects, not what my face looks like.
What dealbreakers or ideal traits do you want in a girlfriend that most of reddit would call you dumb for having?	My list of dealbreakers include: Drug/cigarette use. Tattoos of any kind. (They look trashy as hell on women.) Swearing. (A swear-word or two occasionally is tolerable, but I'd prefer none at all. I've been with my current SO for 2.5 years and I have never heard her swear, so it is possible.) Piercings in places that are not the ears, nose, tongue and mouth. (Seriously, WTF is up with nipple piercings? And those stupid eyebrow ones are even worse.) So go ahead, reddit. Explain why I'm an idiot.	Dealbreaker: No passion for something that isn't material or just a total fantasy. I need *some* ambition, I like to see people always improving themselves. Ideal: I actually like shy and clingy, as long as they're within reason.
What TV show or movie do you view differently from when you watched it as a kid or teenager? How have your opinions changed?	ICarly. I used to sometimes see this with my nephew when they visited years ago. Didn't realise it at the time but Sam (girl) used to constantly seriously assault the boy character Freddie, like at least once per episode. And this was proper assault not just slaps (which aren't excusable either) and it was all done for laughs with him never being permitted to defend himself. In fact she assaulted other male characters like Gibby and some adults too but only once did she attack a female	The Phantom of the Opera. I fell in love with the musical when I was a child and grew up loving the angsty, misunderstood Phantom. Why on earth would Christine fall for that bland goody-two-shoes Raul? Erik is totally the one who's more in love with her, and he can sweep her off her feet with his music and tragic backstory. At the age of 33, I realized that Phantom of the Opera is my Twilight. FML.
Which qualities are important to you in a future pizza?	Pizza is one of my least favorite things. I get that statement is an abomination, but there are just too many other foods I prefer.	They need to be hot, but not too hot, that's intimidating. And while I can appreciate a certain level of cheesiness, I don't want them going overboard.
What's the best thing about your pet?	My conure will lean back on my chest and ask for head snuggles by laying her beak away from me.	Her personality, she's the most vocal dog I've ever owned; she'll have complete conversations with you. She's sassy. Last night I was ignoring her because I needed to work, so I turned my back on her, she walked around looked me in the eye, gave a very deep bark, and immediately walked off. It was totally a "Fuck You!" bark. She's 65 pounds of solid muscle and is terrified of the neighour's 3 pound kitten. She's obsessed with snap peas; like goes nuts for them, she eats a small bag of snap peas a week. Whenever there is tall grass she bounds through it like a deer, hoping and leaping through the fields. [Here she is](https://imgur.com/a/LgerM).
When did you last say "fuck it" and went along with something that probably wasn't a good idea, but did it anyway?	Had sex with my FWB, I really need to stop because I have strong unreciprocated feelings for him. I didn't want to, but then he suggested sex in the shower....... it was really good and fun sex. Sigh we'll chat next week, he'll tell me he doesn't feel the same way, then I'll be heartbroken for a bit. Wicked fun.	Last weekend my girlfriend and I capped off a long day of day-drinking and Netflix binging by demolishing a large pizza and six Dunkin' Donuts in one sitting. I admit that it was my idea, but I still probably shouldn't have gone along with it.
CNN just fired comedian Kathy Griffin for her "anti-Trump" photo shoot. Do you believe she deserved to be fired? Did she go too far? Or are public figures fair game for just about anything?	I thought it was pretty fucking funny, but I can see why CNN wouldn't want to be associated with it.	It's not the fact that it's Trump's head that pisses me off it's he fact that it was a recreation of an ISIS photo. Completely insensitive and too far. Should she be persecuted for it by the government? No. Freedom of speech. But that doesn't mean CNN doesn't have the right to fire her.
Full time working men, what do you do after work that makes your weekdays a little better?	M, M, fucking, A. Nothing gets the frustrations out like practicing your most violent takedowns and trying to shove a dummy through the floor.	I work out. I work with special needs people and I love my job, but after a 12 hour shift I need an hour of not talking to anyone and lifting heavy things while an angry black man yells about how the tables flipped now we got all the coconuts bitch straight from my headphones
I dream of starting a cat-friendly bar, like a boozier version of a cat cafe. What are your silly business ideas?	I think all offices should have cats. My cat, specifically, so everyone can feel my daily pain of trying to type with a cat laying on their arm and licking their hands. But, also, cats are just so relaxing and hilarious at the same time. Too bad about people with allergies, though :(	A clothing store for people who are confused like me, where kind, soft-spoken salespeople take you aside and gently but firmly inform you which pieces look good on you and why, and send you home with a complete trendy but flattering and photogenic wardrobe. "Goodbye!" they call as you go out the door. "See you next year!" You leave content that you will not have to think about how to look cute for the next twelve months, when you do it all over again.
What's your go-to recipe to impress a girl?	Teriyaki chicken and rice or shrimp. Take the rice, chicken (or shrimp) and put it in a bowl, grab some kikomAn teriyaki liberally apply it to the mixture and mix it all together. Women love home cooked Chinese for some reason. My wife knows absolutely nothing about cooking so even just cooking a very rudimentary dish for her during our early dating days was a huge "oh my god I fucking love you" kind of reaction. I highly recommend that guys learn to cook to impress women because so few women know how to cook these days that it actually is impressive for a man to know how.	Risotto. Fancy sounding, not much harder than mac-and-cheese to make (unless you're going super fancy), not *too* time consuming, and slow enough to allow you to chat while it's cooking. Seriously, you don't want to do "omg, it's gonna burn- get outta the kitchen! Don't interrupt me!" stuff on a date.
You know that tangent you were about to go on in the middle of a conversation that would have totally derailed it but was a really good take, and you were kinda bummed you decided not to talk about it? What was that tangent?	How trump hamstringing federal bureaucracies isn’t the same as enacting good policy aimed at shrinking government. A better course of action, rather than unplanned budget freezes and 90% cuts is to ask for each organization to submit an efficiency plan with ways to cut their overhead. The people in those offices know where the waste is. Our government can be so much more efficient. Pulling the rug out from under them keeps them inefficient as well as ineffective. So don’t tell me you support Trump’s policies because it includes enacting said policies and “shrinking government bloat” needs to be done in a way that works. Slash and burn never works and that’s how companies go under.	My coworkers were discussing how funny it would be if someone in our industry (geoscience) was a flat earther. I wanted to talk about the guy who graduated first in my class in geological engineering who believed the earth was 4000 years old. I asked him about it once, his response was “God can make things seem older than they are.” Can’t argue with that.
As a male writer, and as a film fan, I want to ask you, which women in fiction you think has most accuarately represented you? Which one was most free of clichés, platitudes, preconceptions, missconceptions, prejudices, etc?	You ladies need to read about Alizebeth Bequin from the Eisenhorn trilogy, what a woman! Edit: This is just some reading a friend handed to me one day and it opened up a complete universe based around a board game I do no play. The character is one I will always remember, very well written.	All the women from Parks & Rec. I'm half Leslie and half April, but I want to grow up to be Donna. Even the unlikable characters feel very real in that show.
What can an ugly woman do to be seen as worthy of love?	Be willing to be with a man who's just as ugly. If you don't like that option then you either need to absolutely luck the fuck out or get less ugly yourself.	"I do try to be upbeat and cheerful but the loneliness eats away at me" OP, hang in there. You're doing all the right things like putting yourself out there. Opportunity will come at random points in your life; the more you meet new people the more chances you get of meeting that special someone who wants to share the rest of their life with you.
Let's talk about the real highlight of going out on the town: What's your favorite "drunk girl in the bathroom" encounter?	Three bar flys crowded into the men's bathroom once while my guy was in there peeing. I was on my fourth strong Bloody Mary. He came out and was like those chicks goosed me while I was peeing! He had to pick me up and carry me away from the bathroom entrance before they came out. I was pissed.	I just really appreciate every time I've been in a shitty club bathroom where none of the doors lock right and girls stop what they're doing to hold the door closed so I don't have to struggle doing a weird leg thing
I've had primary custody of my 15 year old son for 3 years. He called me today, to tell me he wanted to try living with his mom for a semester. Can someone please tell me how to feel, or what to do?	Sounds like momma wants your money, so she carefully explained all the benefits he would get if he lived with her. Let that run its course, because he will eventually find out the truth.	I think the biggest thing here is not to take it as a rejection. If he's been living with you for a while now, maybe he just wants to spend some time with his mom, especially since he said it was only for a semester.
Men! Have you ever considered whether or not you were being 'sexy' or do you consider this to be an exclusively female condition?	It's not exclusively female but it is much harder to be sexy as a guy. Tall, ripped, rich. Get two of these.	Hah, my default feeling is that my very existence is awkward, but once a girl gives me an indicator that she's interested, I feel like the very embodiment of Adonis. Confidence is attractive, and when I feel confident, I feel more attractive.
Women who were initially unattractive in their young/teen years, and then became attractive, how has the experience been?	Welp, it sucks. I hate that I am treated better now that I am attractive. It discouraged me from fully developing a real personality, because attractive girls don't need to be funny or interesting to get noticed. And being that I am in my late 20s, I'm starting to worry about how well I'll navigate getting older and having to acknowledge that once again, I am invisible.	The people who bullied me at school for being different sometimes try hitting on me and I get a smug sense of satisfaction.
Women in STEM- what are your personal experiences with the gender dynamics in your field?	I'm an accountant. My experience has been really positive. I've not really run into any sexism or other negative gender issues. I work with mostly men and a few women - neither of which cause any problems related to gender. Maybe we're just boring enough that it personalities don't clash? IDK, but all through business school and in my career it was fine. I also have a B.S. in Math and Economics. Same deal - predominantly men, no examples of sexism or anything - the overwhelming majority of my experience has been positive. Not sure how common others experience negative gender experiences or the underlying causes, but, IME, that was not the case	Mechanical engineer here, the gender ratio in my undergrad class was 10%. Overall, it was pretty good, except for the one technician who assumed that I wasn't actually working on an assignment with my teammates in the workshop, but instead, 'had just come along with my boyfriend.' Cheers. That's **definitely** why I'm wearing steelcaps....
ladies who have lost a significant amount of weight,how did you do it?	Drug-induced anorexia. I mean, I know that's not the answer OP was looking for but I get asked this question all the time and I have stopped being coy and evasive and honestly, I went off the medication that was making me fat and onto one that barely allowed me to eat at all.	I follow Weight Watchers. It's essentially calories in vs. calories out, but I have an easier time wrapping my head around 30 points/day as opposed to 1300 calories/day for some reason. Because the plan isn't prepackaged meals or anything like that, it's really helped me completely change my eating habits.
Have you ever dated a significantly older woman? How did it go?	When I was late 20s, hooked up with a few mid 50s women. One was off reddit, she looked her age, but she had huge tits. We texted a few weeks then we met at a casino nearby had some drinks, she's a big gambler so she had reward points. Got us a hotel suite (she paid) I ordered us take out. It felt awkward checking in, but the young cute hotel receptionist probably didn't care. Sex was good, blew a load on her stomache. We hooked up once more at her place when her daughter left back to school (college). The other looked mid 30s, active, some work done. I'd take her out on regular dates, she was kinda nutty but sex was amazing. Creampied her a few times. I'm still friends with her on FB,and once in a while I'll browse her photos and rub one out.	Based on your story I feel like the ball is in her court. I would tell her how you feel and let her decide what to do. It sounds like she’s into you, but just not in the right place to get involved right now.
Do you like it when a woman makes the first move?	Yes, for the 100th time, yes. You are boring AF. Since women have clearly told us (through false alligations and metoo, etc ..) that you dont want us to make moves unless its wanted, we stopped doing it, because we dont know if its wanted unless we try. And you know, other men exist, not just the 6' 6" 6figure men, these other men also want to hit it. Its not our fault you think you deserve the best men available, when all you can offer is boring question, nagging and a used kitty. Now its your turn to put on the pants and go out and actively look for a partner.	Honestly we find it flattering. And a relief. Sometimes it creeps me out, like when a 40-50 something woman heckles me while I’m doing my job as a deckhand (I’m 19 for context) but generally we like it when y’all make the first move
What is your favorite course in Mario Kart , and what character do you play as the most?	Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64. If I'm racing I usually try for a medium weighted character like Mario or Luigi.	I don't have a favorite track but I always play as princess peach. It annoys my children cause they say a man can not play as the princess and I tell them I can be a princess if I want.........Its just my little way of giving them mental issues as they grow up.
Have you ever "broken up" with a friend?	Yes I have. My grandmother JUST passed away and I called my bestie because I needed someone non family to talk to and she was my "go to girl." I asked her to come visit because I needed someone and she told me no because she was in a crappy mood because she broke up with her boyfriend. She then kept on and on about them breaking up when I finally told her basically "get over it because she'll get another boyfriend but I'll never have my grandmother back" and I hung up on her. I ended up calling my bestboyfriend (he's like a brother to me, he siblingzoned me btw, im fine with it) and told him all what happened and he was actually more there for me than she was.	I generally let my friendships fade, rather than breaking it off immediately. Breaking up with an SO is different because I don't have any commitment with my friends to exclusively be friends with them, so I'm not denying them the ability to find new friends by backing off. There's a different level of commitment with an SO. The only friends I've just stopped dead with are people who were a significantly bad influence. There's no need to make people feel rejected otherwise when you can just feel you've grown apart instead.
What is with this "niceness coins, sex vending machine" thing?	It has become a trope because it is so common. If you saw the number of posts on askwomen where a guy is upset that a woman didn't want to date him even though he was *soooo* nice to her and it must mean that girls only fall for alpha assholes who treat them badly... It would make you vomit.	Also consider the corollary theory, as also described (possibly coined) here on Reddit. Many women do start relationships with guys they know are assholes or cheaters because they *know* their love will change them. But then it doesn't work out, of course, and they complain that all men are assholes, and this guy should have changed after all the work they did... "But Men aren't vending machines you can put sex coins into and kindness comes out."
Hey, how has your opinion of dating/sex changed over the years?	Younger: best thing about sex = me cumming Older: best thing about sex = making her cum multiple times then asking her about it	Well, in general ideas, I place a much greater emphasis on making sure that someone qualifies as a potential partner. I encourage people not to overlook things they can't deal with, and not to go back to on-again, off-again relationships. If someone's broken up with you once, that shouldn't be someone you want to date.
What are the most striking or odd examples of men coming up with would-be solutions to women's problems?	Not a solution to a problem, quite the opposite-I'm 100% sure a man designed my bathroom. I have this huge, gorgeous shower with no place to put up my legs to shave them. I put a shower chair in there so I can shave my legs without contorting.	When I was little and my jelly shoes would pinch me, my dad would put them in the microwave and then he and my uncle would each take and end and try and stretch them out. I don't actually think it worked but I have a very vivid memory of it.
What was someting you told your SO that was 100% true but she doesn't believe you?	(I’m a guy first and foremost) that I didn’t care about his size. Then proceeded to ghost me after a six month relationship.	I went to toss a quarter in our change cup, which is an old Talenti ice cream container. Like a pint size so pretty small. Maybe 4-inch diameter opening. I was about 20 feet away and said "I'm going to make this shot 100% do you believe me?" and she said no. I drained it and she no longer doubts me.
Do you have (a) male friend(s) who you have deep conversations with and who you are completely open to, but wouldnt be in a relationship with? Why not?	I met a guy in an online video game, we talked for over 4 years. I was in a relationship and he lived in Canada (me in the U.S.) We were very close and I liked him a lot, but the distance was just too much. Now i'm in Canada and we're engaged; don't ever settle for anything, happiness is always worth it!	I have no sexual attraction towards him, and there are parts of him I wouldn't want to see up-close in a relationship (not physical parts, parts of his personality). EDIT: Also, I'm surprised at this question in general (and I know this is a late edit, sorry, been thinking about it). My default isn't dating somebody, it's being friends with them. Dating indicates romantic and sexual interest on top of that. I can be perfectly compatible with somebody and still not want to date them.
Women in STEM fields, what instances of sexism have you faced at work/school?	Whenever I interact with the public, the questions I receive are way different if I am alone or with a female coworker compared to when I am with a male coworker. When with a male coworker, they always default to addressing him when asking questions even though I know much more about the project. They also tend to ask more in-depth questions. When I'm with a female coworker or alone the questions are always really basic or just something about how cute the wildlife I study is... I also have had issues where the men at work take credit for my ideas. They will take my suggestions and present it as their own idea.	I’m a college student majoring in computer science. Luckily, I haven’t gotten too much trouble because most guys in CS are excited to have a girl there, lol. I have had guys doubt my coding skills though. When we’re working on a group project and I suggest a certain technique, it will sometimes get ignored only to later be brought up again by a guy. And everyone listens to him. *smh* But really, I’m happy to say that I haven’t experienced too much sexism. Edit: Side story, I had a guy say to me that he was glad to see so much female empowerment in this one movie we were discussing. The movie had of a lot of degrading sex scenes with women, and he thought it was great that they were “exploring their sexuality”. *Sigh*
What do you want sexually but never ask your Girlfriend/Wife to do?	Nothing. I've talked with my wife about all the stuff I want to do. She's not willing to try all of it, but we've talked openly about it.	For her to come to me without asking in her lingerie or naked and tell me she wants me to fuck her right there and then. Won't ask because then I won't feel it's her choice to do it.
What’s the most profound thing you’ve read or heard about love?	There is no such thing as love, only proofs of love. -Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne (Robert Bresson but dialogue probably by Jean Cocteau) 1945	In BoJack Horseman, when Wanda the Owl says, "you know, it's funny; when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags." That shouldn't have hit so hard but for some reason it really did.
Brides often say they want their bridesmaids to be able to wear their dress again. Have any of you ever actually worn a bridesmaid dress a second time?	I was a groomslady and wore a black dress. I removed the “sparkly” part and now wear it to funerals. It’s floor length and really nice, but I can’t see myself wearing it anywhere else.	Yeah. In another bride’s wedding. The brides didn’t know each other and happened to pick out the same dresses so I killed two birds with one dress. Other than that... lol no
How did you learn to discern your gut reaction from unhealthy reactions that resulted from abuse?	I mean the best thing to do is to talk about it with your SO or friend (whoever you’re close with that you’re getting bad vibes from). If the person reacts negatively like “I don’t know what you’re talking about, why would you get upset about that?”, something like that, then you know your gut feeling was correct. I, sadly, have always been right with my gut feelings but have never believed them.	Therapy. That is one of the things therapy is good for: keeping past traumatic experiences from being intrusive in the present day.
My parents dropped the bomb yesterday.. they're separating. Men of AskMen who have been in this situation, how have you coped and helped you family cope?	Idolizing your parents marriage is easy, but keep in mind, they wouldn't be separating if they were happy. Just treat your dad the same as you would always have, and if you notice him struggling emotionally, lend a hand.	I was the same age as you. Realise that this is **their** shit to work through, that there is nothing you can do about it, that they are still your parents and they still love you and you can still love them, that you are still a family even though you might not be together, and try to not let them force you into siding with one or the other. You're an adult, they're adults. They can confide in you, but don't let their opinion of each other affect your opinion of them. Basically, treat it like the break-up of two very close friends, neither of whom you can side with over the other, and let them handle it. If they try to be childish with each other, remind them to be fucking adults and deal with it as such rather than drag you in.
Women with male friends, what are your thoughts on having to give up a good friend because his wife doesn't trust him?	Mod note: unlocked after moderation cleanup This is not a debate sub. Do not derail from other people's responses. Please report all rule breaking	Mod note: unlocked after moderation cleanup This is not a debate sub. Do not derail from other people's responses. Please report all rule breaking
Guys who went from chronically dateless to meeting lots of women: what changed?	Me, and my opinion of women. I improved my appearance and confidence. My opinion of women worsened as a result of interacting with them more and learning more about them. (In before, oh noes, the wrong sort of man answered!)	Honestly? Online dating. I'm an OK looking, reasonably intelligent guy, but I had trouble just asking women I liked to go out. Once the relative anonymity of Tinder and OKCupid got me over that hurdle, I realized that it was really easy to have fun on dates and be my usual charming self.
What are some movies that you used to like, but started hating after rewatching them?	The Truman Show. Did no one realize he kidnapped his wife and tried to kill her with a knife? She gets treated like garbage, while he is this naive hero who (probably) gets the girl at the end.	Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper was the coolest movie in the world when I was a kid, but now that I'm older the animation is so bad that I cringe when watching it. I still have fond memories of singing "I'm a girl just like you," though!
Men, when was the last time you felt so defeated and just wanted a hug?	i'm a girl obviously. but for the don't want kids set....this is the best part of living with a small child. they run to meet you at the door with a hug so excited to see you every day when you come home.	I failed college, by a really small amount.. I felt like such a failure that I almost took my own life..
How many guys here didn't have a girlfriend until after high school?	Never kissed, fucked, or had a girlfriend until after graduating high school. I've always been a bit of a late bloomer	Twenty one here, I still haven't. There are lots of reasons, but chief among them is that I don't really put myself out there (and I'm not attractive enough to compensate for that).
Men: How persistent are you in asking/pushing for sexual activities that your SO doesn't want to do? How many times would you ask your SO to do something before giving up?	Im overly persistent I need to work on it. And the same time sometimes when my girlfriend eventually does it she finds out she likes it. I need to be less persistent. She needs to be more open to trying things that she'll likely enjoy.	I'm not persistent at all. It should be fun for both, not "I'll allow it so you shut up." because that's not as much fun.
How can women compliment men?	If you preface every interaction with "I have a boyfriend", anything you say after that will be purely platonic. As for how I feel when receiving a compliment, it feels good, like the rest of the world is finally catching up to these great things I already know about myself.	Generally speaking men don't get complimented from strangers. You can almost say anything. Something about self worth is a good way to go. "Hey I like that jacket, fits you well, dude."
What male character in tv or film is obviously a female fantasy?	I don't know if it counts since the author is a guy, but tons of ASOIAF characters fall under this category. Example: Jon Snow	I don't necessarily think he was intended to be, but Jack Dawson from Titanic. A free spirited, open-minded, heroic and romantic artist who would do anything, including die, for his true love.
Gaming women of reddit: do players act differently once they know your a Women?	Oh yes. I mostly play The Elder's Scrolls Online and GTA. In TESO, it doesn't really make any difference because a lot of women also play. But in GTA, it's different. I often get very popular, but some men get patriarcal. I've been told "Oh, that's little miss I know it all!" I've never been told stuff like that when they didn't know I was a woman. Other than that, it's cool. I guess it's because I'm good at it. If I was a beginner, I'm sure I would get a lot of gender insults.	Yes... one of the main reasons I don't use mic, have a gender ambiguous gamer tag, and play with my real life friends only on multiplayer. The few times I've used mic in game I immediately regretted it. Guys send you friend requests, say everything from "oh great now we're gonna lose" to "[my gamer tag] sounds hot".
What's a feeling you need to just vent because saying it in real life would do more harm than good?	I have this new coworker and i just hate her, mostly irrationally. There was some confusion when she got hired and it looked like she'd been hired to take some shifts that were supposed to be mine. We worked all that out and I actually talked to her and apologized for being chilly. But now I just find her so damn obnoxious. She's super bubbly and overeager and grating to me. I felt guilty about it cus ~LADY SOLIDARITY~ but I realized that nobody likes EVERYONE and it's ok for me to be annoyed by her. I'm not a jerk to her, I'm perfectly cordial. I just avoid being with her 1-on-1.	My job is so boring, but I need it because it pays a lot more than any other job I could get, and my long term goal is slowly becoming closer to reality. I am not challenged, I work on a team I don't mesh with, the work itself is boring, the culture is weird, and I feel like it is making me a boring/uncreative person. This is the reason people become so dull. I know it's temporary (contract worker/3 year contract), and I get to work near my BIL (who I am close with, we get lunches twice a week), but it's soul sucking. At least my other jobs were interesting. This is just... mind numbing.
If you were to advise young girls on what to look out for in guys, what would some of the things be?	He needs to respect his parents, especially when they try to help him. He needs to respect your body, and when you say "no" it's your word, not his. He needs to respect your money, and realize it's your money not the whole "our" money. And only is the "our" money acceptable when both of you make an income, and buy things equally.	Not respecting boundaries. I think a lot of young women (I know I was bad for this) will excuse behaviour that pushes their boundaries because they don't want to come across as being annoying or uptight or whatever. It's okay to stand up for yourself and ditch the guy who can't respect your boundaries!
What's your worst tinder experience that led you to stop using it?	This needs more exposure on twoxchromosomes or something because even though these are bad I’ve heard worse. Guys are creeps.	I had a scary experience when I was hooking up with this guy and he started to spank me, hard. When I asked him to stop he would just act like he didn’t hear me. I realized how far away from my home I was and how much stronger than me he was and how he obviously did not care what so ever about my well being or consent. So I just closed my eyes and let him finish, I don’t know how he didn’t notice me crying. When I left he asked if I wanted to see him again and I said I’d think about it. I was going through a difficult period in regards to my self esteem and relationship to my body, and I hate that I let myself go through that just to realize some things about myself.
Do you feel like guys, in general, fail to account for average to unattractive women when generalising?	To a degree, but I also think there aren't as many unattractive women as there are unattractive men, so I do think they're right at least that women in general have it easier than men in general. I'm not really sure how much easier, though. Obviously there are more variables than attractiveness and even an attractive girl could have trouble if she's just not particularly confident or willing to put herself out there.	Yes. "Women get free drinks, chivalry, and sex!" Oh honey. Conventionally attractive women get that shit. Your average Justine does not.
Ladies of askwomen, how much of your body do you shave (or use another method of hair removal on)?	I shave my legs, from just above my knees to my feet, my armpits, and my groin/genital area (not all of it, but quite a lot). I also pluck any hairs that grow on the tops of my feet and my big toes, along with the random long hair that grows out of the "beauty mark" on my face or the random long hair from around my belly button. I shave solely for my own comfort only. All the hair I shave and/or pluck I do because it is hair that otherwise annoys the frack out of me.	I shave: * legs * under my arms * toes * knuckles * some of my pubic hair And then I pluck my eyebrows. I do all of these things almost every day because I find hair itchy and uncomfortable. I don't have particularly thick or dark hair.
If you could rewrite the ending to your favorite fairy tale, children's story, or nursery rhyme, how would it go?	Mulan realizes she really prefers dressing as a boy, falls in love with a Geisha and becomes best bros with Shang.	Little Mermaid: She WRITES A LETTER to Eric saying that she made a deal with Ursula and she can't talk so if he kissed her that would be greeeaaat. And then they actually learn about each other. Then she decides for herself that damn, I fell for this dude just because of his pretty face but we don't get along well at all. She goes back to the ocean and apologizes to her dad because she is only 16 and a dumbass.
What impact do your career and finances have on dating?	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, other than maybe you should network with more like minded men for friendship. Look at it this way, there are a SHIT ton of unhappy marriages, families, and dysfunctional children. Marriage is something that needs to die. Nobody should get married. Most people had kids in the past because they had to. That was there retirement. Thats not true anymore. Kids and lifelong SOs are not inherently bad things, but not everyone wants them. And its an option for more and more people. Your life might not go the way you think it will, and in ways the current you would not like. But thats true if you walk the other path too.	You need to consider why money is important to you. I'm career oriented and I value saving and investing for the future, because I never want money to be an issue in my life. Not going out with my friends because of money would be the exact opposite of what I want. Love, friendship, and family are what drive me to work hard and be disciplined. What's driving you?
I just found out my parents are getting a divorce after 32 years of marriage. What do I do?	In your case I would not seek out contact with my parents. Talk to your sister or other siblings for support if you think it helps you, but otherwise rely on people outside of your immediate family for support. I think it's a very serious form of disrespect that your parents have kept you out of the loop through their strife, and even more-so that they have already made the decision and still decide to actively keep you uninvolved. The onus is on them to make that right - let them come to you and don't let them shame you for not trying to untangle the mess they've made should they try.	You let them live their life. Chances are that they were unhappy for a long time and just stayed together "for the kids". Let them move on, find other partners and become happy.
Do guys daydream about finding the right girl?	Uhm, nope. I'm thinking about how the fuck I'm supposed to find a decent fuck buddy that I can improve and have fun with and have lots and lots of sex with. The closest thing I've come to thinking about a girlfriend is what kind of "dates" I could come up with. But us Swedes don't really date either. Relationships just seem to happen so I don't even know.	Definitely. I think about how she'll get on with my mom. Seriously, my mom always bonds with my girlfriends and stays in touch with them after I break up with them. It's funny. I think about how we'll do things together. I think about teasing her. Surprising her with flowers. How we'll hold hands. How she'll rest her head on my shoulder when we're at the movies or wherever. Or even just how we'll laugh together and joke and play fight and so on and so forth. It's not good for my health, that's for sure haha.
Kinky people of /r/AskWomen, have you ever had a "bad" BDSM experience?	I had a bottom who didn't know his boundaries well. He *said* he was willing to go to a certain point, but in reality, he stopped far short and complained during the entire fucking scene. I was so frustrated; I refused to do BDSM play with him after that because he didn't know shit about his own boundaries and needs.	I learned that I *cannot* be ignored as a "punishment". It sends me to a really scary, dark place and I still don't know why. I'm always upfront that it can never happen for me now though. I also think that 50 shades should be considered harmful because it promotes dangerous/abusive behaviour and newbies won't know better resulting in a lot of emotional/physical harm.
How do YOU cope with your loneliness?	I go out and talk to people. EDIT: drugs and jerking off is not coping, it's self-medication that does nothing to reduce loneliness. Why are we getting these pathetic r/foreveralone type questions here in r/askmen?? I get incredibly lonely sometimes and depressed. But I do something about it. If I'm not up to talking to people, I at least go to a public place where I will see people. I go visit my parents. I talk to someone somehow. The fear of rejection will only get larger if I continue to isolate. Interacting with people will only get easier if I continue talking to people.	I lay in bed. That's it. The only things that get me out of the house are my job, grocery shopping, and going to the gym. Depression is a bitch, especially having to go it alone.
Do guys ever think "That girl is too much for me?" If yes, how so and why?	Those men are wankers. For the right one, you will be perfect. But if you truly want to change yourself, do it because of how you feel, not because some guy told you.	For me, girls that were “too much” were the ones that lived for drama and went in ridiculous moods or held grudges over the silliest things, that was too much
My 30-yr-old daughter just leased a house with a girlfriend. How do I ask/say it's okay if she's gay?	You don't. If it is, she'll tell you when she's ready. As the other commenters suggested, telling her you're proud no matter what will make it an easier conversation for both of you if you need to have it.	you look dead at her and say "I am proud of you and your choices, if you ever need my help I am here to support you." It's deep enough for her to understand and its not bold enough to make her get embarrassed .
Guys who do not go to bars/clubs to pick-up girls, where do you go instead?	I don't fucking pick up girls. I meet people in general, and get to know them, and sometimes ask them out, and I also use OKcupid. The majority of new women I meet are from ballroom dancing.	Do things where you can expect to encounter people you don't know, and where the activity gives you a few hours cover to get to know them easily. It can be parties (especially if you have a wide social circle, less so if your friends are a close-knit group), it can be a group/outing club for an interest (ex: I'm in an outdoor activities group), concerts (pit is best), conventions, etc.
What are the funniest/weirdest fashion comments you've received from your SO?	"I like the color of that dress, but it's hard to explain. In some light, it looks green, in some it looks purple. It's grurple."	We were both in the bathroom one day getting ready for the day and I decided to put my hair half up. As I'm gathering it up and smoothing it out, I secure it with a little clip. I notice he's staring at me with this weird look on his face. I ask him what's wrong and he said, "I always thought that was a clip on hair piece...that's actually your hair?" I lost it. Apparently he thought whenever girls had their hair half up, it was some sort of weird clip on hair toupee for women.
Older men of askmen(45+), how many women have you genuinely loved throughout your life so far?	At the age of 23 two, my mother and my ex. Still looking for my next girl, it honestly seems so easy for other people so im unsure if i should lower my expectations or just keep going with what constantly turns into a fling.	Six. Six serious relationships. I look back and it seems like I've had more than my share of love in life. The last one was the hardest when it ended, the only time I married. It's been two years since she left, and I'm not over her yet. I don't feel that I'll ever love someone again, that I'm just broken, but that can't be true. I'm 45.
When do you tell your friend that his girlfriend js a gold-digger?	so what makes you think your friend is blind. He sees what you see. He's not dumb and knows he's being used just like she's being used for her bimbo looks. That is often the kind of interaction men with money make with golddiggers. Unless he's a dumbass who needs his friends to point out the obvious, he knows. LOL, does he think she actually finds him fascinating/sweet/cool/interesting/any of the above? No, no he does not care. He cares about having an annoying little airhead on his arm as eye candy and you getting all outraged is... laughable. He knows where his money is going, he knows what he paid for.	So my first question is about his ex, what's her relationship with your friend? Did he dump her and does she want him back, does she just dislike this girl because she's dating her ex boyfriend?
Women over thirty, what do you regret the most from the ages of 18-25?	I didn't take advantage of my youth and every other advantage out there. School - I would have stuck with it. Health - I would have developed better habits that would be part of me today.	I don't know if they are real regrets, because I am VERY happy with my life and path now. But looking back, 99% of the time, anytime that I settled for anything was a mistake. When I didn't fight for a larger salary. Stayed in lackluster relationships. Didn't say, "no" when I should have. Didn't say, "yes" when I should have. Basically, it was me being naive and insecure. Now, I'm more confident and have no problems asserting myself and my needs.
Wife filed for divorce. What am I in for?	R.I.P. You fucked. Your best bet is to try and play the victim and really play the judges emotions trying to get sympathy, that's the only play I have seen that can work. If you can't you are ultra-fucked.	You should talk to an attorney. Each jurisdiction handles family court proceedings a little differently, so if you want accurate information about the process, you should talk to a pro in your area.
What’s the most common-knowledge thing that you’ve had to explain to your SO?	I had to explain #metoo to him last a year a good month or so after it became a thing. That was pretty shocking. He claimed he had no idea because he doesn't use Facebook anymore.....	My husband needed some eggs boiled for a science project he was teaching at school. He asked me if it was possible to boil them with the shell still on them. 🙈
How do I beat my boyfriend in wrestling?	Before I was on hormones, when me and my boyfriend would wrestle, I'd constantly move. Keep his hands separated so that he couldn't hold me. If he did get me in a hold I would use my fingers or toes /foot to tickle him since he was extremely ticklish. Once he let go I would get on top and hold him down. And that would be the end, usually I didn't beat him. XD For reference: He's: 6'2" 350 lbs I'm: 5'4" 200 lbs	I hesitate to say this but you should be aware that he's almost certainly holding back through fear of hurting you. This means that you shouldn't be looking for ways to hurt him as quite a few of these posts are suggesting, there's nothing worse than a woman who doesn't realise a playfight is a **PLAY** fight. Now, if you're not willing to cheat like that (and you shouldn't be) then you're basically screwed, he's almost certainly bigger, stronger, has more reach and there's a good chance he's even faster than you.
What’s the least cheating-like thing you consider cheating in a relationship?	Getting really drunk, or otherwise becoming intoxicated, without me there and without telling me first. It's not strictly cheating, but it makes me feel the same way that cheating would. It's partly a holdover from my extreme straightedge days, but also it just... I dunno. I don't like the idea of my partner becoming impaired if I'm not there to take care of them (and not finding out until afterwards). Also the idea of them having a bunch of fun without me adds to the jealousy factor.	Hanging out with or texting or talking to another woman and hiding it. Any of the above would be perfectly fine without the hiding it part. That really crosses a line with me.
What do you eat for breakfast that keeps you feeling full until lunchtime?	I eat a steak, maybe yogurt and maybe veggies as well as coffee. It keeps me full till breakfast the next day. I also only eat once a day	Breakfast burritos made and frozen ahead of time. Pop in the microwave for 2 mins and I can scarf it down in no time. Made with scrambled eggs, salsa and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. Then a giant cup of coffee when I get to work.
What’s the shadiest thing you have done to hurt your ex’s feelings or “get back at them” during or after a breakup?	I hooked up with them again after the break up only to leave again, it wasn't too get back at them I was just lonely.	When I was 13 I sent unwanted pizzas to my ex's house. His parents came by and spoke to my dad, who grounded me and I never did it again.
What tropes in female characters annoy you?	The thing that annoys me more than anything else is when there is this badass female action hero character who does amazing feats of strength that I could never do, played by an actress with biceps the size of her wrists. Like, Gregor Clegane is played by a professional strongman champion, but Brienne of Tarth is a runway model. Just the idea that women are allowed to be strong, but they still have to look sexy and traditionally feminine. It's like "OK, sure we'll put her in this movie, but you know this is completely fantasy, and real women can't actually do this without elf magic, right?"	She's a wildly successful woman- a great job, great education, great apartment, great friends, great wardrobe, great car, but boy howdy, is she just a mess with men! When she gets near anything with a penis, she just cannot handle being a normal person!
"Creepy" is a word used a whole lot these days. What do you legitimately consider creepy for men? When is the word used and you think it isn't deserved?	Just a reminder to keep it civil in here and to not abuse the report function if you disagree with people. The cardinal rule of here is to not be an asshole to others. Futhermore: >Be respectful. Anyone is allowed to ask and answer questions. Do not provoke, troll or insult people. This includes in PMs.	Just a reminder to keep it civil in here and to not abuse the report function if you disagree with people. The cardinal rule of here is to not be an asshole to others.

Has anyone else noticed any words that tend to be used differently across genders?	When men say they don't like women who wear make up, they mean they like women who wear natural looking make up.	I think respect often has different connotations between the genders. Women seem to more often use it to mean being treated with dignity and common decency, something that should be extended to everyone because it's good manners or even just good morally. Whereas men seem to more often use it to mean something more like admiration, it's something you have to earn before it's given to you, more of a status symbol.
Can someone please help me figure out what this guy is thinking??	SUBWAY. Healthy, tasty, and barely more expensive than buying the ingredients on your own to make your own sandwich. I never get anything more expensive than the $5 footlong [$5.75 here in Canada :( ]. Also, dem white chocolate chip macedamia nut cookies. Plus now they have spinach here (more healthy shit, fuck yeah).	Damn, I totally fell for the title and was about to begin another exasperated reply. I think it probably counts as fast food, but The Habit burger joint (If I remember correctly, it's mostly just here in California) is fantastic.
What the fuck are you supposed to do when you walk past a woman alone at night to let her know you're not a murderer?	I think this thread has had enough responses and now a lot of the comments are turning into victim blaming, so I'm gonna lock this shit.

Why does toilet paper fall out of my guy friend's pants?	I'm like 100% sure he stands up to wipe his ass and toilet paper being shitty (hah) it shreds a bit while he's wiping. Some of it falls down into his pants, underwear and on the floor. If they don't notice it on the rim of the toilet seat it's because **he** notices it and wipes it off. He must not realize it collects in other places or maybe he does and just doesn't care. But I'm 100% sure of what I said here. I would put money on it. source: Happens to me but It doesn't collect in my pants lol	I once had an anal fistula, basically like a boil beside the butthole which will never heal, that will leak fluid (sometimes blood if you scratch it or wipe too hard) I spent a few years with a tissue wedged in there (graduated to a band-aid and surgical mesh when it got worse) Eventually saw a doctor, it was diagnosed and surgically removed. I'm pretty sure this is what your friend is going through.
Beard lovers, have you ever had a man you're attracted to shave his off... only for you to discover he wasn't so cute under all that hair?	You know, I tend to think if a guy isn't sexually attractive without a beard then he isn't sexually attractive. Just like if a girl looks like a 10 with makeup but a 4 without. She isn't a 10 then.	My boyfriend's mom had never seen her husband (BF's dad) without his beard. One day he shaved it off after losing a bet, and she made him promise to never shave his beard off again.
What moment do you look back on and can't believe how much of an idiot you were?	Believing that Hillary Clinton actually had a rat ass chance in hell of winning the US 2016 Presidential election. She is a born loser and will remain that way forever and ever.	When I was 14 my brother and I fell for the hype of rock band. Summer of 08 we went to get the game but it was like $180 and our mom didn't wanna spend that much. So what did we do? We traded in almost our entire GameCube collection, including what are now some hard to find or expensive games. That plastic drum set broke within a month and we got tired of the game shortly after since the drums were the most fun part... Fuck rock band and their shit tier hardware. I would do anything to have my old game collection back.
What's the biggest misunderstanding between men and women in our society?	That men want really skinny women. All my girl friends go on and on about how hard it is to meet up to this skinny standard of magazines and movies. And all except one of my guy friends couldn't give less of a shit. They would much rather have some boobs/ booty and a little tummy over some twig any day!	That they're somehow in competition with each other. Any time one side says they have it bad, the other side has to come out to say how they're wrong and they have it so much worse. It's like we're still in kindergarten playing boys vs girls on the playground.
What's something you saw coming from miles away that other people didn't?	I’m into astrology and I love paying attention to upcoming transits and for 2020 I saw that there was going to be an event that resulted in a lot of deaths and sure enough the pandemic hit	onlyfans shutting down pornography on its platform after it reached a certain level of prominence. paypal and patreon both did something very similar.
Boy-trying-to-be-a-man here, my parents are pressuring me into getting a first job and I am seriously dreading it. What are some good first jobs or, alternatively, some advice that could help me be more prepared for this?	Ask your parents for help in finding a job. Maybe a friend has a business? Many people say they just wish young job seekers would show up the second day. Construction and garden work is hard and out in the elements, but invariably they are looking for people to work. Do you have a school counselor? I know, it's the wrong part of the year, but school will start soon. One of the first things you should do is check in with them. Like others have said, you can always quit if you don't like it.	I was where you were at before, I bet almost everyone was, I did not want a job at first, it felt like just another responsibility to eat up my free time, but having money allowed me to buy a car, and have money always, I made a few good friends and it was all in all a good experience. But finding a first job you enjoy is borderline impossible, there is a reason kids can’t get jobs that pay good wages, and you’ll end up doing something kind of shitty
Have you ever had a friend develop extremist views? How did you handle it?	Yeah, I’ve had a few go SJW and a few go in the other direction. Not a fan of either camp, but the former especially can’t seem to have normal interactions without making it into some sort of exercise in politics. We don’t speak much anymore beyond a social media “Happy Birthday.”	I'm not sure if this counts because it isn't what we all generally think of as extremist buuut... One of my close friends from college has gotten *extremely* into astrology and the like. I don't give a shit what you believe for the most part but she cannot think outside the context of what planets are aligned or whatever, and it's gotten so bad that I cannot handle more than a 5 minute conversation with her. I feel bad because she's a good person but it's like her personality is now in this little box!
Women of reddit, do you believe in "you have to love yourself before you can love someone else" quote and why?	No, it's the other way around. The person who truly loves you with all your imperfections (can be a parent, a friend, a sinlibg, SO, doesn't matter) can show you why you deserve to be loved	I feel that means you shouldn't make relationships (including friendships) just to validate you but it's good to make relationships that fulfill you
When it comes to hygiene, Where do you draw the "unacceptable" line?	I shower whenever I know I'll have to go outside. So 99 percent of the time outside of the odd weekend day which is take out and surf the net. Honestly if I can notice it. Not clean teeth is number 1, also with longer hair daily shampooing is a must.	> The "no poo" movement of people who refuse to wash their hair ever. It's not using shampoo, not refusing to wash their hair. Shampoo pulls the oils out of your hair more so than just showering does. If you have naturally dry/coarse hair, it's just making things worse. If you have greasy hair, it's useful.
Guys who had horrible, manipulative relationships, why did you put up with it?	I didn't really accept it was manipulative and toxic. Women are far better at mind games than men. Added to that, men are trained to believe it's not possible that way round.	Because of the manipulative part. A good manipulator makes you feel like this is what it's supposed to be like, will threaten you into staying, will invalidate your feelings. Only when the relationship ends and you feel 10000x better do you realize how bad it actually was for you.
If your sexually active girlfriend randomly said "No sex before marriage." What would you do?	Lol. Boy you guys are a long way from emotional maturity that will help you last. Why don't you suggest a little third party counseling? If you're serious about her, I've had some counseling that helped my boyfriend and I skip right passed all that nonsense to the real issues. Poor thing is just insecure and young, and heard some stupid BS that made her have unrealistic expectations of you and/or what a loving relationship requires. She just wants to feel the most special. Find a way to show her she is but is expecting to see it in the wrong way. Good luck ;) you kids	I do not miss dating in my early twenties. Edit: does she also get jealous of the idea of you masturbating?
What are your thoughts on OkCupid switching from usernames to legal names only?	I used OkC to meet my now-husband years ago, and I use it now to meet new people (open relationship). No way I'll continue to use it. Too fucking dangerous. I'll stick to Tinder, thank you very much.	Sounds like a great way to get most women to stop using their website. We already have to deal with enough creeps when just using a username.
When do you find your SO most unattractive?	when she gets angry and huffy over something that she will forget about completely within 36 hours. you know what i mean, when you ask her later what she was mad about and she can't even remember. all she can remember is that *you're a dick*. some girls just need to throw tantrums and whine in order to get their fix on attention and to test whether you can handle her shit or if you will cave to her shenanigans. you both lose the moment you take it seriously.	When she pointedly forgets something that definitely happened in the past because it suits her argument. Oh *man* that one is frustrating. Oh well, we all have our flaws.

Women of reddit, does your self-esteem get better with age?	Not really. Not for everyone, because we're all different and you just become worried about different things than when you were younger. You worry whether you look older,etc. I guess if you're married, you don't care about a lot of things, but when you're still single, your self-esteem is still tied to how people react to your looks,etc.	Absolutely and a good deal of that can be contributed to fully embracing the "Zero fucks given" philosophy. At 49, I literally give zero fucks about what anyone else thinks of me, and I feel much better about myself now than I did in my 20's and 30's. It's liberating.
What is the creepiest "I stalked your Facebook" story you've heard?	In college MySpace was a thing. Huge. So all the students were on MySpace and I think I had a lot of ransoms added. One day a guy messaged me that he saw me in the school restaurant area. Turns out his apt wasn’t too far from mine too (same complex)	I went to a concert alone and spent the evening sitting at a table by myself. Didn't speak to a soul. Went home to a Facebook message (from a stranger) along the lines of "I saw you at the show tonight." NOPE.
Women on the autism spectrum, what was the moment that made you suspect something was wrong?	I've always had a harder time with things than others. When I was in my late 30's I took a test just for fun and scored super super high on it. It was then that I took a few years and started doing research on it. It totally explained my life.	Not so much a realisation that something was 'wrong', but a realisation there was a name to my experiences. I always had problems socialising with others, to the point where I seriously thought I was an alien observing others. They didn't get me and I clearly didn't get them. I was bullied for my quirks and school was generally miserable. Then when I was a teen, I read a book called Nobody Nowhere where the author wrote about being autistic. That's when the penny first dropped - that there were others who felt off-kilter to others and it had a name.

Muslim women, do you wear a hijab or burqa (or any other head garment)? And how does it make you feel?	I do wear a hijab and I love it. The women in my family have always worn it to show our love for God and I am happy to continue the tradition. I only have one thing to say to people who insist a woman can't wear one without being forced or coerced: fuck off.	I wear a hijab, have for most of my life, and haven't felt any real animosity! Sure, there are second glances and too long stares from some but nothing too unbearable :) My biggest worry was if my patients would feel uncomfortable around me (just a med student) but but they've been great! My concern was whether they'd feel uncomfortable or ask to see someone else, but no one has seemed surprised/unsettled and we've gotten along fabulously, alhamdulillah :) I consider it an integral part of me so I pretty much take it into consideration when getting dressed. Fashion is a huge part of my life so I make sure it *complements* my outfit or vice-versa if I'm rocking a particularly cool hijab :) *Edit--wrong use of compliment. Hijabs can't talk :)
Men here on AskWomen, has browsing this sub changed your views?	In a way yes, I thought I held feminist views until I started following this and other female orientated subs. Now I reject "feminism" and prefer the term egalitarian.	Yes. Probably the most important I realized is that every woman has different preferences, so whatever insecurities I have that I can't change doesn't really matter. I just need to be the best I can be and hope someone out there likes my particular combination.
I woke up to my roommate standing in my room, he’s male. What do?	Second that sleeping beauty comment. Wear a man thong with elephant trunk. 🐘 Or he could be a gay vampire a la twilight Ed ogling sleeping Bella (you)	Start by asking him. If you don’t like what you hear, consider getting a lock on your door. That is pretty weird...
What are your three biggest red flags for a new relationship/friendship?	Addictions, whether that be alcohol or drugs or gambling. Personality disorders - ie psychopathy, sociopathy, narcissism. I have to be very careful as this are exactly the kind of men I'm attracted too. DAMN.	* How they treat others. It doesn't matter how nice someone is to *me* -- if they're ever unnecessarily rude, harsh, or judgmental towards other people, then that's the real them and that's how I should believe they'll treat me once the novelty wears off or I inevitably do something they don't like. * If I ever feel that I need to walk on eggshells around the person, change myself in any way, go out of my way to seek acceptance from them, etc. * If they say or do things that regularly has me feeling embarrassed around others, having to make excuses for them, etc.
Men who make 100k+ a year, what do you do?	Majority of people in tech, consulting, finance, law, or STEM fields will earn over $100k. Many of them will even start at or very close to $100k right out of school. If you're struggling to hit $100k you're probably in the wrong field, in which case you need to think about whether it's worth studying again to try and change career paths. Some people are completely happy with less work, less stress, and less pay. Everything is a trade off.	Front end web development / analytics. When you know how to shape an online experience you can get people to do all sorts of things (mostly buying stuff).

How do you differentiate a natural fading of lust in a LTR from an actual and irreparable lack of sexual desire that would be fatal for the relationship?	Who is teaching people about sex? This isn’t confusing. If you’re not that into her, it ain’t gonna work. People think relationships are about feelings and emotions. No, that’s the icing. Relationships are about sex. And if you’re not that into her, you need to find the one you are. Personality and love do not keep a long term relationship. Every marriage I have seen survive is because they both are very much into each other physically. Lust doesn’t fade. Excitement does.	A big part of it is what the purpose of sex is to you. People who stay in 50 year relationships banging the whole way through dont view sex the same as someone who has had 50 exciting partners. Typically LTR that involve regular, lustful sex uses sex as a tool to reaffirm love/trust/acceptance/forgiveness and other squishy feelings. Exciting sex with new people is a celebration of just how sexy and charismatic you both are by engaging in the greatest feeling in the world. As the hormones and new relationship energy dies away, the need to celebrate this is lessened. That's my view anyways.
What's the dirtiest things girls have done to you that you secretly loved?	I love golden showers with my girlfriend, so one day she decided to do a poo on my penis while she was riding me. It was more of diarrhea, and as I went to blow she splat all over me, and it was like a watergun fight. I really enjoyed it.	She said she had a surprise for me as she was on top riding me, then just before I came she hopped off, went down on me and sucked on the tip like a straw as I orgasmed. It was so intense and so long that I thought I was time traveling.
Parents of /r/askmen, if you had the funds to move your immediate family anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?	I wouldn't. I live in a safe neighborhood in a safe city where both my wife and I have stable and good paying jobs, my daughter has all her friends and mentors, and uprooting them all just for some fantasy of living in some exotic locale would be foolish.	Always thought New Zealand seemed nice. Rustic, quiet, and about as far away from the crazy northern hemisphere as you can get. Plus hobbits.
What are some of the fetishes women you have dated have had?	Slapping her face during foreplay. No. Couldn't do it. Liked calling me daddy. And saying "fuck your little girl". Always hot. She also liked fucking me while wearing one of her fur coats. Wasp. Another loved getting spanked and getting the back her neck bitten while getting fucked from behind. Anal stuff. Hair pulling. Half filipina/half Indian. Another loved anal. Loved blowing me in public places. Filthy talk. Wasp. Another likes to spit on my cock when she's blowing me. Loves getting her face soaked in cum. Tells me to spit on her pussy when I'm going down on her. Spanking. Hair pulling. Squirting. Latina. I don't even consider a lot of these things fetishes really. They're common preferences.	An ex had a fuck-a-total-stranger fetish that didn't mesh well with a monogamous relationship. My wife likes it when I give her firm, but courteous requests. It's very specific. Brutish dominant bossing around doesn't do it for her. And certainly not "Honey, would you pleeeease..." The perfect note to hit is polite and gentlemanly with my words, but with a tone that expresses my relaxed, utter confidence that she will do what I ask. It's the courteous manners of a man who is in control and knows it, but puts his commands in the form of gracious, even sweet requests, not because he has to, but because *that's how he likes things to be.* It's a sweet gentlemanliness, with a subdued confident assertiveness that's so subtle that strangers wouldn't notice it.
Was there a time when you had a feeling, thought you were crazy, and turned out to be right?	I have had this feeling that the new boyfriend a friend just introduced to me is going to cheat on her 3 times now. (3 different friends, 3 different men / occasions.) And I have always been right. It's weird. And I never know what to do when I have that gut feeling.	Once I felt like a man had followed me onto the subway. I tried to brush away the feelings, sure I was just acting paranoid. When we pulled up to a station a couple stops ahead of mine I pretended to get off just as we pulled up to it. He followed me to the door, so I hopped off the train for a split second and then jumped back on after he had exited. I saw him staring at me as the train pulled away. There's a chance it was nothing, but the look on his face after the door closed was seriously unnerving. I think I might have avoided something very bad that day.
What was the absolute worst wedding you ever went to?	Not a wedding, I rarely attend those anymore. But my cousin's communion. My aunt thought it was 'different' to read a roll call of all the people who helped with the party preparations. So we sat there for 20 minutes whilst the compere read out a long list along the lines of 'Tanya's communion dress designed by ABC', 'Food catered by XYZ'. We were laughing our asses off at the stupidity of the whole thing and still laugh about it 15 years later.	When I was about 7 and my brother was 5, my father got married again. The adults left us in an empty dining room with a bartender for most of the event. I remember hiding under a table. The bar tender was nice and gave us pretzels, I think. They let us into the ceremony just to be ring-bearer with the rings on a pillow. They let us into the reception for a few minutes and my grandmother gave me 1 fork full of cake. It was lemon and I didn't like it. ETA: AFAIK no pics exist of us at this wedding with my father and stepmother, the bride & groom. Seriously, who gets married and doesn't take family pics *with their own children*.
Tall dudes (&gt;6'0), what are advantages short dudes have that they don't realize?	I'm about the same size as you and I don't have any of the problems you're describing. Neither do any of my 6'-ish weightlifter friends. Though I don't do gymnastics. You need to buy better fitting clothes.	They fit in most modern cars without their heads being on the roof or having to practically lay down to see out the windshield.

Do you shower in the morning or at night?	Morning, I want to be fresh for my friends and classmates. Whoever showers at night and goes to work or school in the morning without showering is a fucking monster and should be sent to Australia	Both. I shower when i wake up, and i shower when i get home after the gym while my dinner is in the oven.
Women not taking husbands' last name after marriage?	I wouldn't marry a women who wouldn't take my last name. Not that it would be a problem though because the type of women to be against taking my last name wouldn't be the type of women id want to marry.	It's 2015. A lot of women keep their own last name. A lot of women take their husband's. And a lot of women hyphenate. Unfortunately, no matter what the woman does she's going to receive criticism from self-proclaimed traditionalists, from self-proclaimed feminists, from family, from friends, from people who have no right to be invested in it. What I'm saying is: it sucks, be prepared for it. As it happens, my wife did take my name, which was my preference. However, it's not a strong preference. If she had wanted to keep her own name, I would have been disappointed, but she's an adult, she gets to decide what to call herself.
What’s up with nudes?	It’s for the guys seeing picking up women as a game to make you feel better than your competitors Or just something great in a relationship	Can't say I've gotten any nudes in a long time. I'd have to assume because it's much more personal when someone sends *you* nudes. More so than just finding them on the internet
Where is the worst place you've ever had to pee?	It was in some horrible hotel in Russia. An orange looking fat businessman asked me to. He had very small hands.	A porta-potty at a festival. Someone had food poisoning or something. There was vomit and liquid feces all over, and sticky urine on the floor. The heat index was in the triple digits and the humidity was... enough to make you sticky in places you didn't know existed. And it was in a crowded place in the middle of the day, so I couldn't just duck into an alley or crouch behind a dumpster.
I've heard a lot about Nice GuysTM but are there NiceGirlsTM? If so, how do I spot them? Do you any of you ladies know any?	They frequent tumblr. They have 50s style hair and cat eye glasses. They're morbidly obese or at least have a huuuuuge overhanging gut. Her arms look like ham shanks on sticks. They will have hair that isn't a natural color (blue and pink are favorites). She will settle for no less than a >6ft Adonis executive with chiseled abs you could grate cheese on. She "isn't worth anything less." But he can't be a chubby chaser, because that's insulting. She will wear extremely unflattering clothes "as a statement". Her armpit hair is so long it has cowlicks. She will call those girls who take care of themselves and have confidence "skinny bitches". "Thin privilege" is a common appellation. She is not looking for a "nice guy". She is the "RealWomanTM". Because "guys can't handle a Real Woman, they always go for skinny bitches."	I used to be one. I thought, "hey, I'm funny, I try to be nice, I shower daily, WHY DON'T BOYS LIKE ME?" Well, because I was clingy and annoying. I was also socially awkward and didn't understand the basics of how relationships and interactions with the opposite sex worked. I wanted a relationship for the sole purpose of being a relationship, not for any other reason. It took some time and soul searching, but I'd like to hope I grew out of it. It was mostly in my late high school/early college years that I was one.
What would you guys do if you woke up on New Years Day and realised it was the start of 2014 again?	Does starting a youtube channal earlyer count? If it does, i would be totally ._. since it would be a ton of wasted effort, but a faster startup :D + i would be starting off better content	My grandfather and my dog would be alive again, so I'd spend a hell of a lot more time with them both.
Men who've been married for a long time, are you still attracted to your wife?	I'm not married but I'm going to answer anyways. Looks fade and that's normal but you stay because you fall in love with the person.	Married 22 years in May. Still attracted to my wife. Her looks have changed, no doubt. She started changing pretty fast when she hit The Change, but I'm still attracted to her despite what she may fear. I try to show her by offering to make out at random moments (parked in the car, at the movie theater, ordering drinks at the local tavern) which never fails to make her blush. Which is good, because that makes her even prettier.
Question for guys who are US citizens: if the US gov't were to reinstate a military draft, what would you do?	Maybe I'd move to Canada. I'm a citizen there as well, plus I have some family there. Ain't no way I'm going to war. I'm a sensitive artist, not a soldier!	If I was younger, I would do the same thing my grandpa did during world war 2: go and enlist so I could choose a path other than front line infantry. I'm 29 now though, so I probably don't have to worry about getting drafted.
What movies make you cry?	Someone is going to say Up, and I just want to say that I really don't get the big deal about the intro. I don't really feel that connected to them as it's so early in the film, it almost feels sad for sad's sake which doesn't really do it for me. I remember welling up a little at the end of Blood Diamond. Great movie. I usually find myself more teary when something is excessively happy than sad, which I guess kinda strange.	Interstellar, when the video messages are being read. That scene always gets me. Also, the ending of blood diamond, "I'm exactly where it's supposed to be"... Damn. As always, Marley and me. Can't even blink. Finally, Lord of the Rings. I'm big on movie music and those epic scenes with the rohirrim in the two Towers and the return of the king have brought tears to my eyes. There was also a part in the extended edition where eowyn is found by eomer on the battlefield and he conveys some really powerful emotion.
What is your personal Planned Parenthood story?	I LOVE The Hood. I have an alter ego named Kiki who is an older jewish lady from New York. I regularly prank call my hood ladies and try to order birth control. They love it, they say it breaks up their monotone day. Anyways, since day one they have given me un-judgemental care. For me though the biggest deal was my first Herpes outbreak, they were kind, gentle, and had no judgement. I can't coo about my Hood enough, they have been there for me thick and thin.... Actually I owe them flowers.	When I was 20 I was in a horrible, abusive relationship and I got pregnant even though I was on birth control. I went to planned parenthood and found out. I scheduled abortion services which killed me emotionally. The women were so supportive and told me that at any time I could leave because I was clearly upset. It was the best decision for me and made me feel empowered to leave the relationship I was in. I truly appreciate the women who were there for me and supported me.
True crime buffs of AskWomen, what case(s) keeps you up at night?	I'm huge into true crime but no cases keep me up at night. I've never been really bothered by any of the documentaries. The more gruesome and sadistic, the more enjoyable. I'm just a sick person, I guess.	I've watched a lot of Forensic Files, and some of those episodes really creep me out. One I think of a lot is where a girl got back to her apartment really early in the morning after dropping her friend off at the airport (like around 4 or 5am). There was a guy in her apartment parking lot breaking into people's cars when she got there, and he ambushed her, forced her to drive to a secluded area where he raped her, and then he shot her and killed her. It scares me because it was just so random. She didn't know the guy, she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Stuff like that is my absolute worst fear.
Have you masturbated to most of your male friends?	I don't know what kind of bros you hang out with, but as a male I can say that I have masturbated to maybe 10% - or less - of my female friends. They're *friends* for a reason, and if I wanted them for anything more, I wouldn't consider them a friend. I'm guessing that, for women, it's 0%.	Nope. I've never thought about any of my friends. Guys I'm dating/sleeping with, yes, but friends no. My mind just doesn't go there.
Have you ever clicked with someone perfectly and enjoyed each other's company so much, but realized that a long term relationship could never work out? How did you accept that and stop longing to be with that person?	Haha I am married and have these two ahhhhhhhhhmazing guy friends that I know I can never be with. I often fantasized about it and wondered if I’d ever leave my husband for either one of them but I quickly realized that my husband is the only one that can put up with me. 😂 plus they have different personalities too - there are certain aspects to their personalities I am absolutely in love with that my husband lacks. But what I realize is that it’s okay - there are people in your life you’ll meet that fullfill different sides of you and one person can’t be perfect. So I am quite happy in my circumstance. Blessed to have my friends and my husband it makes my life complete lol	I read a ton of books. Didn’t put pressure on myself to find someone new right away, and treated my heartache as if it were the flu—a physical illness that would be soon to pass. Then I let myself get better and took precautions not to have more pain than necessary— like cutting all contact with him and restarting my life with a new, stronger outlook.
Happily married people, when did you realize your marriage was awesome and what makes it awesome?	Same here--my marriage is easy. Married a year and a half, together for 5, friends since we were in middle school. We know each other and strive to learn each others' changes. We laugh a LOT and share a similar sense of humor. We fight sometimes. We make up. We put in effort without knowing we're putting it in, because we love each other and want to make the other's life easier. We pick up the slack without question when the other is down. We thank each other every day. It's awesome.	I've always known my marriage is awesome. Lots of things make it awesome but i think the main point would be: - we work hard on it and regularly check in with each other about how our relationship is going
Why would men think of women who approach us first as "desperate"?	Woman here, that had to give my two cents. I approached my bf. We were on a dating site and I knew what I was looking for... No time for others. My profile was hidden, only those who I contacted could view it. He said that he was surprised and pleased. He totally understood my reasons and respected that I know what I want, go after it and don't play games. We're mid thirties and tired of the bullshit that seems to go hand in hand with most relationships.	I would love to be approached by a woman and would look very positively once I figured out she was not selling anything.
What is something you cared about a lot when you were in your 20's that you no longer cared about when you got older?	Being the "good guy" even when the action wasn't really something i agreed with/thought would help. Just didn't want to rustle feathers. I'm a lot more honest now. I live by my own moral code and im a much better person.	Video games. I just don't have the time to care anymore. I still enjoy games, but I can't tell you everything about every game that's coming out/came out in the last/next 6 months like I used to.
Why is loneliness among men such a huge problem and how do you cope with loneliness?	You have made a fundamental error in the premise of your question. Loneliness isn't pain, it is a somber companion. And most men are alone because we have to be. 90% of women want the top 10% of men or are happy with a house full of cats. So, just by sheer numbers, most of us wind up alone. C'est la gal. Golly, I sure hope I don't get a bunch of silent butthurt downvotes or whiny comments confirming my username...	It is a thing because we are taught not to rely on anybody else for help for the most part (in this world you're on your own as a man) and not to talk about things. Girls on the other hand are raised in a more social way and opening up easier in most cases. I myself am not a lonely guy but I don't have too many friends either. I don't get lonely easily because I really love being on my own. I find it easier and relaxing. Don't forget you can also be very lonely with many people around you. In fact if I had to choose a loneliest situation I remember it is one with many people.
What are some of the biggest mental blocks men really bad in dating have?	Asking women out and dating has always come really easily to me... and that's because I don't take it particularly seriously and I don't treat a woman's reaction to my advance as a judgement of my worth. The vast majority of the posts I read on Reddit regarding dating and concerns guys have about is... are tied up in the guy being overly analytical and putting way too much weight into what happens. The absolute worst thing that can happen if you approach a woman and she rejects you is that you are *exactly where you were before*: without a date with said woman. It's like looking for a job. You will never be employed if you don't look. The worst that can happen if you look for a job is that you end up in the same position: without a job.	Thinking that no girl could possibly be interested in them. Thinking that whenever they say something to a girl, she's responding only out of courtesy, and is thinking to herself ''Does this guy really think that someone like me could be interested in someone like him? He's ugly and pathetic. Why is he asking me if I come to this bar often or do I listen to this band usually, when both of us know that it's just a ploy to get him talking to me, get my number, and eventually ask me out? Why doesn't he simply cut to the chase so I can reject him and be done with it?''
When was the last time you were legitimately scared of a man?	When I realized the guy with blown up ears and an 8 pack was my next opponent. My fear was well founded as he effortlessly took me down and mauled my half guard for 5 long minutes before the clock ran out.	I was raped a few weeks ago in my own home. Been pretty on edge about the guy coming back. Anyway, my brother came by to visit one morning and let himself in. He had texted me to say he was coming over but I slept through the texts. I woke up because he said something from the kitchen and I didn't recognize his voice. All I heard was a man in my house and I was scared shitless for a second until he said something else and I realized it was him.
Former average guys who started lifting and got buff. Was there a big difference in how much attention you got from girls or were you disappointed because it wasn't as much as you thought it would be?	Puberty hit me like a truck. I was always short, and sort of 'cute' then over the course of a year and a half I grew about 1foot. I stayed almost the same weight due to my extensive running, a few years later, and I've definitely filled out. Roughly the same height, but I'm about 20kg heavier. Attention went up after puberty, but it's definitely gone up moreso since then as I improved my wardrobe and the way I held myself.	It was noticeable. Though I don't know if that was because I looked better, or that I carried my head a little higher as I had more confidence. I suspect a bit of both. I was out the other night though and a female friend asked to feel my arms and stuff, which was quite funny! I've felt so much better about my body since going to the gym. I feel much more capable.
What have the questions asked in this subreddit taught you about guys?	That dudes will always be praying that there is some all-encompassing answer that they can get from one woman that will help them understand the rest.	That there are guys out there who are even more sensitive or concerned about their interactions with the opposite sex than I am. I find that interesting somehow.
What do y'all think of girls wearing chokers?	Hipster sluts who tend to pose as feminists on Tumblr tend to wear them alot. Be prepared for some bomb head and a headache.	Not to be trusted. They take them off and they go from super babe goth chick status to wrinkly old crone with a dusty vagina.
Taken from r/AskMen. What are some uncommon signs of immaturity in a man ?	Calling their mom "mother" exclusively, I don't mean like "my mother" when speaking formally. I mean all the time even when you have never met their mom the still say something like "Mother and I used to visit that farmers market all the time." "Mother used to cook me this dish every Sunday." I am sure their are exceptions to this but both of the immature and abusive men that used to be in my life did this and it has stuck with me.	I consider a man to be immature if he is unable to take criticism or any sort of feedback that isn’t positive. How one handles being told they’re wrong or doing something incorrectly says a lot about them. If they react with anger or denial, it shows they’re too immature to admit when they’re wrong or don’t know something.
What's your story about picking up and moving to a new city?	First time I moved cities I didn't have a job but I did have a place to stay and I was able to pick up temp work really easily, and then land a job shortly after that. I had saved quite a bit of money so I was prepared. Second time I did it I moved countries as well. I had no job, no place to stay, I just up and moved. I was prepared as far as money goes. I had saved and saved for years. It took a long, long time to find stable work. First time I did it was to see what it was like to live away from where I grew up, second time I did it because it was a lifelong dream and if it was ever going to happen I had to just go for it.

How do I stop/prevent being boring?	You're not necessarily boring. You're just an introvert. Also consider that the other person may be the boring one since the two of you clearly have nothing to talk about.	Listen to people and ask them questions about what they are telling you. Ask them about them. People like talking about themselves more than anything. They'll talk about themselves for an hour and think YOU'RE interesting. Edit: Fixed your/you're
Sharing a room with male higher-up on business trip?	That's absurd. An individual room per person no matter the gender is the only professionally acceptable way. March right up to him right now and say "I will not be sharing a room with you on our trip, that's absurd" OR "I quit, you disgusting pervert." Your choice.	Yeah, no. This can't possibly be right. This HAS to be a misunderstanding. Go see your boss and clarify this. Make sure you make no assumption and no accusation. Just simply state: It looks like you only reserved one room. Should I reserve my own room, or have the plans changed and I'm not going? If he specifically states that he expects the two of you to share one room, tell him in no uncertain terms that you are not comfortable with this and will not share a room with him. If he has a problem with that, go to HR and/or get the hell out of that employment situation.
Has someone ever purposefully broken up with their SO to be with you? What's your story?	I left my wife of 3 years for a woman who was engaged for 2 years. We worked together and started a friendship before we knew it we were emotionally cheating. We were both unhappy in our relationships so we left out SO's and hooked up. It's been 7 months and I couldn't be happier.	Yes, my ex told me that she dumped her boyfriend to be with me a few months after we were together. Then she did the same thing to me eventually. She then had a child with the guy and then he cheated on her and they got divorced. She then contacted me when she heard I was getting married and wanted to get back together. I said no way.
Men who are very frugal and money-wise what tips could you give us young guys?	DON'T GO INTO DEBT. Life-threatening/ruining situation is the only exception. Cook at home, use everything (like instead of throwing them out, you can gather and freeze bones and then make bone broth that will give you basically free soups for a week) Buy clothes in outlets. You can get amazing stuff for next to nothing, but you need to hunt. If you need something specific, buy off brand. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs. And if you do, do it in moderation. Those are things that ruin budgets of poorer people the most.	Don’t upgrade your lifestyle right when you get a pay raise. You were living just fine before so why change?
What's your favorite type of girl to date?	Lookswise? Short, busty, sandy blonde hair, blue or hazel eyes, my gods, they're a treat to look at and a ton of fun in bed. Relationship-wise? Women who have seen some of the world, who work hard but don't tie their self-worth into their paycheck, educated (and not just in terms of a degree; I'd rather have a girl with an associate's in English or history than a girl with an MBA who skated humanities as an undergrad), yet with a naturally submissive, feminine nature. So basically, a girl-next-door sweetheart with a brain.	The comfortable ones. You know you meet some people and you just feel the need to be guarded around them? And then there are other people where, even if you've just met, you're so much more willing to be open with them than with others? Like, you feel as though you can be yourself and they won't judge you? They're a tough kind to find but they save worry, time, and they're usually just great to be around. The kind of girl where you can just say that stupid thought you just had ("do you think dogs have a favorite type of poop or puke to eat, like solid poos or white ones?") and even if you get a "What the fuck?" look you know she'll move past it.
How the hell do I go to a club and do it right?	Every time I've had fun at a club there were three main ingredients. 1. Go with a group of good friends 2. Bring a girl, I know clubs are supposed to be places to get women. But it's very loud and women are so guarded in clubs I've found it's easier to just bring your own. 3. Drink enough alcohol to allow yourself to go crazy on the dance floor. If that's one drink so be it, I need several.	you go in with some people, get absolutely wrecked, dance like an idiot and talk to everyone you bump in to at the bar etc then you've either hooked up with someone with your slick moves or you're throwing up down the street
What "type" of girls (or guys) do you typically attract? Are these girls (or guys) the "type" you find yourself attracted to?	I attract stereotypical neckbeards because of my nerdy interests and black dudes because, for a white girl, I apparently have a bit of a booty and I'm also in the minority on my side of town. I'm attracted to atheletic, socialized nerds. I want someone who will run a 5K with me one weekend and go to comic/anime convention with me the next. Also, at 5'9", I am one of those evil women who like men taller than me.	Spooky gals. The number of ghosts, spirits, psychics, demonic posessions, tongues-speakers, and shamans (shawomans?) I've encountered in my past ~9 years of relationships is way too damn high.
When was a time someone who considers themselves to be very open minded and tolerant proved to be exactly the opposite?	There was this one comedian Aziz who claimed to be on women's side in public. Turns out he has some pretty rapey tendencies in private	I know a ton of people in my parents’ generation who were (rich, white) lefty in the seventies and think that that gets them a free pass to be considered lefty for the rest of their lives. So, they’re super judgmental and look down on poor people and barely tolerate gay people but think they’re liberal because, like, they smoke pot and think black people should have Civil Rights.
I think my friends fucked me over... But am I in the wrong?	Fuck em. Cut them out. Still living with them? Ghost them. If I were in your shoes, they wouldn't exist.	Just playing devil's advocate a bit, but did your friends actually say they were going? Or were they just invited but never confirmed?
How old are you and how often do you hang out with friends?	i'm 31 and i moved to a new city a couple years ago so I don't have many friends to hang out with. But back where I had a solid friend-base, about once a week.	I am 72 and all my friends are dead. Most of my enemies are dead too, but I'm working on it.

Why are more men doing Tea / Coffee Meet Ups for first dates in this modern age?	On another note, from what I see in my female friends, the more a guy *invests* on the first date, she'll be more likely to think he's serious and sincere, hence more likely to reciprocate. Some girls tend to invest less emotionally if they feel the other party seems to just test around. What's so wrong about it? Girls know why some guys want to do cheap dates with them. Those who don't, they naturally stand out. If you don't feel any need to *invest* and she doesn't seem that interested, just move on to the next girl/guy. You didn't lose much as you planned so.	Dating is expensive. Going out for coffee is vastly cheaper than going for a full dinner before you even know if you like someone. And if you don't like that person, it can be a 20 minute date instead of an hour where you have to fake an emergency call to get away from the crazy.
Men of Reddit.. what insecurities do woman have about themselves but it doesn’t really bother you?	For some woman. Less make-up would work better. More ≠ better. For some even none is better. Its really diffrent per person. But never overdo it	Being too tall. I’m only 5’5, I have no room to be picky about a woman’s height. That, and I find tall women attractive
Women that moved in with your partners, what made the transition easier for you? What's something you wish you knew before?	We kind of gradually started living together. He was living with his parents and I had an apt (college). He spent more time at my place, spent more nights as it became more convenient, and eventually he had all but moved in over the course of a year or two. We never really had a conversation about it, and we just started getting comfortable and spending more and more time together. I know that isn't how it is for a lot of people, but it worked pretty well for us, as we were able to work out problems as they came up overtime rather tha jumping straight into it.	Many other people have given great advice, but I would add that you should ensure you're both on the same page on the status of your relationship and what moving in together means. To some people, moving in together is no big deal and just means that you get to spend more time with your partner. To others, it's a sign of large, serious commitment. If you're on different pages on that, you should know it. My now-husband asked me to move in with him somewhat flippantly as a convenient plan. I had to explain that I did not want to move in with a partner unless I intended to marry them. So, we waited and moved in together when we were both ready to make that commitment.
Women who have gotten abortions, what was something you were not expecting/weren't informed about about abortions until you received one yourself?	My friend recently had one and had originally tried the pill but failed so she had to so it surgically instead.	A lot of sources say that after an abortion procedure, you should be fine to go back to work, school, etc the very next day. Honestly, my procedure was fine, no complications whatsoever, but I still took a couple of days off of work... And I still ended up feverish with some infection symptoms, despite my best efforts to rest and recover. The only advice I can think of to offer is to tell her to take time off of life to recover, if at all possible. And if she needs an excuse for work or school, I found that "minor medical procedure" was an excuse that nobody questioned, if only because employers are legally obligated to not question it.
I'm the only man in an otherwise all women office and I'm constantly left out of lunches and after-work events. What should I do?	Tell them you are feeling excluded and that you won't bite or tell their secrets but you want to be part of the group! Put your hands on your hips while doing so and pout out bottom lip to make it more effective! When all else fails beg and shame them!	I had a similar thing when I started at my most recent job (although opposite as I was the only female with a group of males). I used a two pronged approach of a)inviting myself to things they organised (can be awkward at first but it turned out the main reason I wasn't invited was because they didn't think I'd be interested rather than actively trying to exclude me; and (b)organising things myself and getting them to come along!
To those that have lived both in and out of the US, what cultural practices do you wish were more common in the states?	Things I wish on the US: politeness, the time taken to just be a tiny bit formal and make sure you say hello and how are you doing before you ask (ask, *not demand* - please and thank you!) for what you're after. The right of hospitality - like someone here mentioned for Scotland, this is common in most other countries: you're a visitor, you get a drink. Not offered, not wait to be asked, it's there and it's yours. Same goes for food. And finally, the right to just drop in on people, without having to call ahead and schedule something that fits into their timetables *and* yours and maybe just putting it off entirely because who wants the hassle? I didn't ever find something in US culture that I wanted to export to other countries.	I'll explain with a story: I spent a summer in Valencia, Spain. I went to a bar often with a handful of Americans. We were leaving the country and wanted to go to the bar on our last night. We get there and it's closing early so the owner can start his summer vacation. One hot-shot I was with was like, *keep it open and we'll buy double what you make in a single night.* The guy had money to burn. The bar owner looked at him like he was crazy. He basically said, *no amount of money will keep me from starting my vacation, you crazy American.*
What was life for you like before and after taking antidepressants?	Before: crying fits for hours, several times a week. Sitting down and looking at the wall for who knows how long. Barely went anywhere. 2 meals a day. Now: a couple crying fits a year. I'm aware that my body needs 20 mins of rest after work, and that's okay. I plan and go places. 20 meals a week.	Before: Massive mood swings. Hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, and bursts of productivity and creativity followed by long periods of lethargy, apathy, hopelessness, self-loathing. After: bizarre behavior, paranoia, and thought I had 6th sense type superpowers. Turns out I had bipolar disorder, not depression, and so I needed a stabilizer, not an anti-depressant. After stabilizer: I have virtually no symptoms anymore. I have a full range of emotions, but my emotions and energy level are just...normal. There was no perception of “it’s working!” because nothing felt remarkable...which is actually how you know it’s working. Sharing because sometimes the first diagnosis and/or first prescription isn’t right for you, but the next one might be better.
Have you ever been in love with someone, but held back from being with that person? If so, why?	All the time. Why would I want to "be with someone" when I love them, what's in it for me? I mean I spend time with them but I do that with friends too; I cuddle friends and I cuddle lovers the action isn't much different in the last case but I guess it physically feels a bit more chemical and not necessarily better.	Ever met someone that you just clicked with on every level but they already were in a relationship since the day you met and that relationship looks like it's never going to end?
Do you leave it in after you have sex?	No. I'm putting spermicide in the condom so I don't get hit with a sudden 18 year case of "children"	My ex used to always ask me to leave it in. She liked the feeling of it pulsing inside her. Often we'd just leave it in while cuddling / kissing until my erection subsided. There was always something really intimate about it that I liked.
What do you think of Gloria Steinem's statement that women who support Bernie Sanders are doing so because they want to please "the boys"?	No, no, no! I don't support Hillary because she's just like all the rest of them. Washington has changed her. Yes, I think Bill Clinton was one of the best presidents our country has ever had. I think a lot of that had to do with the time during which he was president. I do not think Hillary could replicate what Bill did. As a NYer, I know that she just used my state as a jumping off point for her political aspirations. She didn't give a shit about us. Bernie Sanders is, I think, the only politician I would ever trust. If he said the sky would falling, I'd definitely run and hide. I honestly don't think he would lie to us. He's walked the walk. And, he'll keep walking the walk.	It's pretty fucking irritating when anyone assumes I do anything to please the boys or be like the boys or some nonsense like that.
Ladies, what are some typical problems you experience that men dont have/will understand?	Shout out to all the dudes in this thread trying to argue the validity (or lack there of) all the problems being mentioned. Way to keep the stereotype alive, *gentlesirs!*	When you put in a panty liner but it didn't stick to your underwear properly and ends up rolling back and sticking to your pubes instead. And then it tears a little every time you move. OW.
When Vasalgel becomes available for all consumers, will you prefer to use it or to continue using female-oriented birth control?	Sorry, but no fucking way am I injecting anything in my cock. My gf can use whatever BC she wants, that's fine with me. But I refuse to let a needle anywhere near my member.	I'd use both. Two forms of control is better than just one. Plus, I'm on birth control for medical reasons too.
What false paradigms of life did you buy into ?	That high school is the least important part of your life. Turns out it's one of the *most.* Not in any sort of 'get good marks, go to university' sense (though that's important) but the more I'm around, the more I realize that life in any work-place is basically a mirror of high school, with nicer suits. There's the same back-stabbing, the same gossip, the same smile-to-your-face stab-the-back mentality, the pretty girls/boys get special privileges. And the politicking is the *worst* because it's the *single most important thing* about getting ahead in your career: shmoozing > talent 99% of the time. The aphorism "It's not *what* you know it's *who* you know" is the single most important thing about your career. Makes me wish I were a good, slimy social climber.	If you work hard, be honest, and develop your skills, you will be rewarded, treated fairly, and appreciated by your superiors at work. Conversely, those who are lazy, dishonest, and lack skills will not be rewarded at work. Fortunately, it only took me about one year of corporate life to figure that out that was complete BS, and therefore I was able to survive in such life until I could escape.
What are some "green flags" to look out for when dating?	ITT: girls you set the bar very low. 99% of the stuff in this thread is just basic human decency and sanity.	* Integrity. They do what they say they're going to do. * Compatible libido level and/or compatible kinks. * Communicaton skills. * Emotional maturity. How do they act during a disagreement? Do they call me names? Do they walk off down the street without saying anything? Can they discuss matters calmly and try to see both sides? * Financial savvy. I didn't expect anyone to be rich, but I did desire to find someone else who lived within their means, didn't spend money they didn't have, etc.
Do you treat pretty women differently than ugly women ?	Due to bullying, I have an inner hate for conventionally attractive women (or women I'm attracted to), so I tend to try not to talk to them at all. Any time I do occasionally talk to them they are just too confident, usually up themselves and a bit arrogant. "Ugly" women? In my experience these women are very nice and usually have everything I look for in a relationship but even if I don't look for a relationship (hasn't happened yet I'm 17 and cba), they are more friendly and are better friends. So I don't treat ugly girls better, just in my experience they are better people than good looking girls. edit: inb4 all the good looking girls and shallow guys downvote me	So I was in a restaurant. I noticed two women and a man at the ice cream area. The man gets himself a scoop of ice cream, the 2 women are waiting their turn. The woman that was next, was very pretty. Conventionally attractive. The man looks at her and then offers to get her scoop for her. After he gets her scoop, its the other womans turn. She was much less pretty and heavier. She looks at him, I can tell,shes expecting the same offer. The man hands her the scoop and walks off. All i thought was ouch...
What are the most ridiculous "negs" you've received from guys trying to sleep with you?	"You seem great, I can't figure out why no one has taken you off the market yet" Uhh that's because I *am* great and I haven't found anyone worthy of "taking me off the market" yet.	"I don't really like redheads. I'll make an exception for you, though, because I like your boobs well enough to overlook your red hair." Noped right out of there.
What books by women would you recommend to a teenage guy?	Dude. Read books that are good. Don't specifically get books because it's by a guy or by a girl. The important part is the quality of the writing. Look up the best books ever written, read the classics (there's books by both men and women). But it is weird to prioritize the gender of an author over the quality of the writing. Who cares who wrote it as long as it's good.	The Earthsea series by Ursula K. Le Guin, a series of fantasy novels and short stories that have won a lot of awards and are very highly regarded in the literary world. She also passed away this year, so you could make it your tribute to her. On a similar vein, Margaret Atwood has a series of post-apocalyptic novels that start with Oryx and Crake. If you like sci-fi in general this is very good stuff from a serious, respected author that has books in every genre.
What petty thing do you need to rant about right now?	Alot of "womens safe spaces" I find are "women who fit our ideas of what women should think safe spaces" ive been insulted both after revaling my gender and while getting called a stereotype of the type of man they think disagrees with them. Theese are ironicly Also riddled with claims of how this is where women can escape societies ideals and be themself.	So both my partner and I were on vacation this last week and because we have pets we trusted a friend to watch after them while we were gone. I left detailed notes for everything they needed and left my apartment clean. (I love the feeling of coming home to a clean home.) My boyfriend came home before I did and so I woke up this morning to snaps and text of our apartment.. pee and poop everywhere, food left out on the counter, an ice tray in the fridge, xbox controllers out, pet food open and on its side, and jackets belonging to the pet sitter and his girlfriend. 😡😡😡 All I asked was him to come over and feed them, not to come over to chill, play Xbox and leave my place a mess!!!
What are some books that every woman should read?	Taking Charge of Your Fertility, by Toni Weschler. Even if you don't plan to have children. *to note: I'm not sure that transwomen will get much out of it, and I apologize for leaving y'all out.	A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. Gives a woman's point of view in a place where woman have no rights(Afghanistan). I highly recommend this book to everyone.
What unfortunate character trait can be traced back directly to something in your past?	I was taught to reject traditional gender roles and to look down on them, and as a result I’m not just bad at cooking and cleaning, it literally makes me angry. It’s really unfortunate because those are life skills.	I'm very very big on keeping secrets, and I sometimes structure my life so that I have at least one secret to keep at all times. My parents didn't believe in privacy. I'm 24, and I still live at home, and I was only allowed to start closing my bedroom door earlier this year. When I was a kid, my mother would go through my room to find my diaries, and then read them and punish me for what was in them. She would empty out my backpack once a month or so and read every single paper that was in there. I had to get very good at maintaining separate lives at school and at home, but the result is that I keep even mundane secrets from everyone, just to feel like there's a part of my life that belongs to me.
at point during dating is it appropriate to bake something for your date ?	Thanks for the input - yeah, I think my buddy just went in a little too strong without having a good read on how she felt. That’s the hard part.. reading how someone feels after one date!	I'm in pastry school so to me, it's never too early. That said, I wouldn't accept a baked good on the first or second date or anything.
How much does your SO match your initial idea of the kind of partner you were first looking for?	I would say 85% of what I initially was looking for, before I knew exactly what i needed from a partner. Now knowing everything I need, he meets that for me.	My “ideal” was always the on-the-go powerful businessperson with many degrees, the “life of the party” person who owns a room the moment they walk in. I dated a lot of them probably because I grew up around a lot of them. My SO never went to college, is happy with his life, and would rather cook with me and have people over for dinner than be out at the fanciest restaurants. He’s amazing. It turns out I needed a sweet nurturer more than a powerful leader.
How did you find out you were cheated on?	Male here, sorry😔 Use to travel for work. Came home and everything was normal. She had been reading the fifty shades of grey book, thought nothing of it. Later that night my phone dies, so i grab hers to send some emails. Turns out she has ads on CL looking for someone to be her MR. Grey. Forgave that one, then found out she was having sex with strangers on CL. Forgave that. Then she found a lover at her work, thats when the shit hit the fan. Divorced now but it was a long uphill battle. Happily divorced with 4 kids by my side. She's still sexing around and it kinda hurts knowing she is but what can i do? Cant go back to that. Time will tell when ill find my 2nd half again.	The girl he cheated on me with told me. She had no idea he was in a relationship and when she found out, she let me know what happened. Strangely enough, we're actually sorta friends now.
How do you feel about pre-operative (or non-operative) traswomen in women's change rooms?	If I could be sure they weren't some dude trying to ogle women and/or flash them, I'd be fine with it. But reality is that there are too many perverts willing to do whatever to creep on women.	I don't give a fuck who is in the changing room, as long as they leave me alone; bio-female, trans-female, bio-male, trans-male, anything and everything in between. Straight males in the changing room is no different than gay females in the changing room (and I say that as a lesbian). Don't oogle me, don't make me feel uncomfortable, don't hit on me, let's all change our clothes and go on our way.
Fuck cynicism. What is the most wholesome belief you have about relationships?	A life lived alone is worthless. I don't care what you own, what you've seen, or who you've fucked. If you're alone you're missing out.	I've gotten major pushback from saying this one before: fighting/arguing is not a given in relationships. I've been married for almost 8 years, and my wife and I have never fought. We've had disagreements, but always handled rationally and calmly. We've never raised voices or shouted at each other, slept in separate rooms, or any of the other relationship tropes like that. I've honestly had someone tell me that arguments are basically a requirement for a healthy relationship. Garbage.
AskWomen: What are your tricks/methods/pro tips to save money?	Don't eat out, but if you do, order it "to go" even if you plan on eating there. This way, you won't have to play sales tax on anything (other than certain beverages).	If you work 80-110 hours a week, you make lots of overtime and have no time to spend any money! ~*sobs quietly*~

When women are "freshening up" before sex, are you wiping your butts?	I usually grab a clean *soft* wash cloth and then wash the vulva. Since I'm already there, I give the ass a quick wipe too. That way, if oral's on the table, I know it'll be a good time. (I don't use soap because it's not good for the vulva, and isn't needed for cleanness.) If I don't have a wash cloth for some reason, I kneel in the bath tub, turn on the faucet, and wash with my hands. After I'm done, my partner washes up too. We both love oral, but neither is a fan of smegma, so this quick routine is good.	Yes. And vulva, and making sure there isn't lint and my hair/skin won't taste/smell like urine. It's a quick wash. I haven't yet found signs I'd improperly wiped, but I frequently have lint in my crack. Also peeing, because getting anything besides an empty bladder pounded on is really uncomfortable for me.
What's your shower routine look like? Are we all doing the same thing, or is there a wide variety of strategies?	Btw for those of you that don't shave or brush your teeth in the shower, you really gotta start. It's really enjoyable.	I face the shower head. I like the feeling of the hot water on my hair and face. Plus, it keeps soap out of my eyes. I don't brush my teeth or shave in the shower.
Men who have won custody of their children, what proof did you have to prove the woman unfit?	Hey so this is another thread that has run its course so we're locking it. If you have any questions, please message the mods.	Hey so this is another thread that has run its course so we're locking it. If you have any questions, please message the mods.
Why are you proud of yourself right now?	Thank you for this thread! We all need to appreciate ourselves sometimes. :) Tomorrow's my 20th birthday, and I've been really worried my depression would get in the way. But, you know what? I'm not going to let it. I bought myself a cute new dress today and picked out the makeup I'll wear. My fiancé is taking me out for dinner and a movie and I plan on looking fabulous and having nothing less than a blast! He got me a Disneyland ticket for a solo trip in July, which is something I've never done (but totally always wanted to do). So I'm also pumping myself up to go be independent and have a great time with myself then, too. Feeling good about life right now. <3	I successfully rehabilitated a mourning dove with head trauma even though I have very little experience with birds. I learned how to tube feed her!
What is it actually like to be in a happy, healthy relationship?	It's absolutely awesome. Someone asked me the other day what I had been up to and I sai "pretty much nothing and its great, I'm just happy and content" meaning- when you're in a comfortable, stable relationship you don't need a bunch of outside shit to occupy you.	Respect and open communication are key for us. We have very rare arguments - not even fights. We discuss issues rather than letting them build up. We make each other laugh.
What is something a lot of men do, and you just don't get?	Pee standing up. Sitting down is less messy. It doesn't unman you. If you're at home, just sit down. The person who cleans the toilet will thank you. (If that is you, you will thank yourself.)	I haven't met many men who felt like running away for their life when they saw a cockroach and I just don't understand that. What else does one run away from?
What do you do with your eyes while going down on a girl?	I'm shocked to see all the people here saying they close their eyes. How do you know what you're doing? I never close my eyes when I'm going down on a guy...	Look at her face. Look at her boobs to grab a handful. Look at her pussy to make sure you're doing what she likes. You're thinking too much.
What unwanted advice have you received lately?	i mentioned being fat and someone was just like YOU NEED TO CUT OUT PROCESSED FOODS AND SODA AND EAT MORE VEGETABLES AND LESS GARBAGE AND TRY TO PICK UP A HOBBY LIKE RUNNING OMG EAT CLEAN AND BE HAPPIER!!! AND HEALTHIER!!!! i ignored it. because really the assumption level in the comment was dumb a hell.	A resident at the retirement community told me to smile more or else I'll end up like her. Out of fear I smiled more because I don't want to end up like her.
Men, what do you think of nursing as a career path?	Naturally I admire and respect nurses, but I could never work a job where I'm condemned to be eternally subordinate to someone with more extensive education. For me it was either med school or something in a completely different field.	I think it's a job that has insane hours and can be emotionally taxing depending on the specialization. It's not for most people. Fiscally, the career generates a lot of money. It's a well respected position that I see more men join every year. And it's rewarding in many ways grander than money.
Have you ever straight up walked out in the middle of a date?	Yep! We went to a local bar to shoot some pool. Dude answered a phone call from his mother 15 minutes in on our first date. Not one of those "My mom is sick/a family member is sick/some other necessary quick check-in call" - this was about her wanting to give him clothes and a couch from his brother or some shit. He sat there and chatted with her for *10 minutes*. Not once did he say "Mom I gotta go, I'm on a date" or anything of the sort. Then acted like it was totally normal after hanging up. I went to the bathroom and left out the back door of the place.	Once, years ago. The guy straight up *told me* in the middle of dinner that he only asked me out to make his ex jealous. Yeahhhh...
Have you ever “stuck out” a job for a few years, please share your experience, do you regret it or do you regret leaving if you didn’t “stick it out”?	I left after 6 weeks, I hated it, different job role to what I applied for, they told me on the day I started it was ‘slightly different’ now.	Like, 90% of my "grown-up" jobs. I just sort of assumed that was what the first few years in a person's career *should* look like - utter hell. Honestly, even with that anticipatory mentality, I got jaded and drained and just totally fucked up from the stress of it all. Was it worth it? For most people, including me, the answer would be no. However, if you want to climb, there's no way of avoiding a certain amount of suffering. I felt like my own experiences just shattered my soul - I'm still trying to stitch myself up to date. Some of my colleagues, sure, they complained a lot. But, they stuck with it; they emerged from the fire stronger and more clearly-formed. Until you go through those experiences yourself, it's very difficult to know whether all the bullshit will wind up being meaningful or not.
Have you ever pulled off a successful April Fools prank? What was it?	I faked my death. I had a bunch of buddies help me out. I supposedly got into a car crash the night before, friends found pictures of the same car as mine but smashed to shit, posted those online. I had to call it quits once my parents called me asking why they heard I was dead, and when my ex girlfriend called my friends bawling on the phone. I still think it was hilarious.	went trick or treating on april fools got some fruit a little candy and some pennies People were mostly confused but went along with it.
What are your dating 'orange' flags?	Mod note: To those who might take offense at the answers here and try to argue with them - please refrain. Remember that: 1. This question is asking about *orange* flags, not absolute dealbreakers. 2. Even if it was asking about dealbreakers, it's not an attack against you personally if their dealbreaker is some trait you have. It just means you probably shouldn't try to date the original commenter. (TL;DR - remember we have a rule about invalidation, and we are having to clean up a LOT of it in this thread.)

How do you react to your SO being catcalled in your presence?	Who cares? It's not like him saying something is going to woo your girlfriend. You ignore it. Entertaining it only benefits him.	Usually make a joke. One guy yelled "hey come hang out with us baby!" So I yelled "sorry hun, I'm flattered but I'm busy". They left us alone, I laughed, she laughed. It was all good.
What things should be kept in mind when arguing with your SO?	Guy here. She puts my dick in her mouth, so I'm always cognizant of the fact that she could bite it off.	It helps me to remember we're on the same team fighting the same problem. Then we're not fighting with each other so much as brainstorming how to fight the problem together.
What are some great cooking tips for someone in college, you wish you knew earlier?	If ur on a budget add some spices and fresh veggies to ur 99¢ ramen and u have some gud soup	Look up prison recipes. You think I’m joking. Inmates know how to make some pretty tasty stuff with vending machine foods. It’s impressive lol
Ladies of Reddit, what new dating dealbreakers have you developed as the result of a failed relationship?	- If you don’t read, I can’t date you - Get a job, have a working car, and your own place - Don’t mansplain to me	He has to have his own close friends or family members. Being someone's only emotional support is way too exhausting.
Poor women of Reddit,what's the strangest thing you've been told you shouldn't have because of your financial status?	Nice clothes. Good makeup. My 3ds, tomodachi life, Pokemon x&y, animal crossing new leaf (a gift from my sister who knew I was lonely and depressed and jobless). I got told I couldn't have them because I was poor and jobless at the time. /waits for more down votes for answering the thread/	I watched a pretty great video about a Canadian Street nurse who works with homeless people. They talked about how a fair amount of homeless people had cellphones. People I know have been angry when someone has begged them for change, when they're holding a cellphone. You'd think that really wouldn't be a necessity when you don't have your basic needs met, but even homeless people have families, friends, and could need it for getting a job, etc. It's hard to see things from another person's perspective sometimes.
What are the most positive aspects of being a woman?	Being able to hide things in your vagina. I admit that sometimes I’ve wanted a little trinket in a store and was a bit overly cautious...	I guess people are less likely to consider me a threat? So when I ask for help people respond without any suspicion. Like when I got lost in an English town and had to get back to my hotel. My phone was out of battery and I was out of cash. I asked a man cleaning his garden for directions and explained that I was lost, and he told me to wait a bit and then brought his daughter out to drive me to the hotel. I could have been a bad person for all they knew, but I imagine me being a woman and Asian probably helped in this situation.
Married women, what is one thing that you skipped on your wedding day that you do not miss? Or what do you wish you had skipped?	I'm getting married this year and am skipping the following things, which I don't intend to regret: * Bridal shower * Rehearsal dinner * Formal reception after the ceremony (dinner at a restaurant with only 20 people instead) * A professional photographer & staged photo shoot * Engagement photos and Save the Dates * Engagement ring and proposal * Bridesmaids or groomsmen or any bridal party * An aisle and walking down it * A bouquet and a veil * Bridal lingerie * Getting ready robes or lounge wear * Professional hair and makeup All of this is just about our personal preferences and not cost.	I cut out wedding favors because who wants a bar of soap with my face on it? And I cut out the father/daughter and mother/son dances because my MIL is a harpy from the deep who would take her moment in the sun and milk it (like commandeering a microphone and giving an inappropriate speech). We also didn't do cake but did donuts and churros instead lol.
What are your best AND worst online dating stories?	Worst: started texting a guy I had matched with on Tindr. This was during my "fuck it I do what I want" phase, and I sent him videos and pictures of me, including a clip of a video of me blowing someone. I broke it off because he became extremely jealous and possessive after not even 3 weeks. He ended up sending the guy I blew the video I sent (which he knew was taken since he had held the phone). A couple of weeks later he texted me saying he'd pay me to blow him. I got mad, of course, and refused. He said unless I did it, he'd release my stuff. Said a bunch of lies about how he was still talking to the other guy and how they both had girlfriends and we're just using me. I ended up going to the cops.	Worst: We decided to meet for dinner at 7. he was an hour and 45 minutes late. His reason? He was at the gym doing leg day in the single squat rack in the gym, a personal trainer asked him to move so his client could work in, he refused and stood his ground in the squat rack, after 30 minutes of arguing gym management called the police to arbitrate the situation. And after all that he still had to finish his squats because priorities.
Ripped guys, how do you stay so shredded?	i have 5.1% body fat. shredded to the bone. i hate it. putting on weight takes me SO long and i have to eat SOOO much food. Just genetics i guess.	I eat mainly greens, berries, legumes, salmon, tuna, veggie patties, eggs. Sometimes eat rice, cheese, tortillas, pizza, tofu but it's rare. No alcohol, smoking, junk food, sugar, soft drinks, I prefer sparkling water and smoothies. I lift at least 5x a week, go swimming 2x a week, do yoga 2x a week. I sit in the steam room after every workout. On my off days I go for a walk or hike most of the time, sometimes I just rest the whole day. I'm 28. I used to live the exact opposite of this lifestyle a few years ago, trying to go into my 30's firing on all cylinders. edit: forgot to include eggs, one of the best protein sources.
Is a girl that cooks really all that important? Why?	Because I hate doing it. Also good, hot food evokes a feeling of someone taking care of you, whereas most women are more likely to give off the entitled vibe of "why aren't *you* taking care of *me*?" If we have to sacrifice so much just to be with you, it's nice to know you actually like us and want to give us something in return.	it is because it shows that you are a self actualized human that can be self sufficient. so that means men should also know how to cook. and both men and women should know how to clean, mend things and first aid
What did an ex say to you during an argument that caused you to break up with them?	boy here, she said that the guy before me had half inch fatter cock, i cried and left her and took our corgi	"I leave during fights because i like watching you beg for me to come home" He had done it a hundred times at that point and id cry and beg for him to come home. He basically liked the attention, it made him feel powerful and it made me weak. The next time he pulled it I told him to never come back
You guys got any good stories involving shitty roommates?	One of my old roommates used to bitch about me piling dishes in the sink and never doing them. He put them under the fucking coffee table and left them there for days. #Fuck you Nick.	Old roommates were awful. The #1 reason why I live alone now. One of them got a dog without consulting any of us. He refused to take care of the dog, and locked him in a crate all day. He only got the dog to show off to girls. We ended up raising that poor dog for him. They refused to buy groceries. Spent all of their paychecks on weed and ate all of my groceries within a day or two. Never cleaned the house. They actually complained when I cleaned because "it didn't feel like home to them" when I did. The final nail in the coffin was when the roommate who bought the dog brought a 14 year old girl home to sleep with. She was the little sister of his best friend. He was 22. I don't speak to them anymore.
My girlfriend recently died in an accident, how do I get past it?	Please take this off and do not ask Reddit for advice with this, for your own good. Seek professional help.	See a professional therapist or grief counselor. A forum such as this is in no way capable of giving you the kind of help you need right now.
What weird things has a doctor said to you regarding your body?	While checking my cervix, my OB said “whoa girl, you are tight!” It was very uncomfortable bc she was hot and I got a little turned on?? Idk I think about it a lot.	The gynecologist with fingers from one hand inside me and fingers from the other hand on my abdomen feelin' my organs stopped and said "Your bladder is about...halfway full". I was like "Thanks, I'll take care of that later".
How do you feel about other men who have been or want to be with your girlfriend?	This sounds a bit like - am I too jealous? A few things I have learned is that your wife has a past you are not entitled to judge or blame her for, it is unalterable and your relationship goes forward to an unknowable future. How well she cleaves to you and rejects other attention is - if you are wise - also her business. You also have little control over how attractive she is to other men and how they respond. Assuming she doesn't actively flirt and flaunt her sexuality you have no complaints or worries.	If I'm honest I get a little jealous about it but I recognize it's my issue and try not to put that shit on her. I've had some. . . rough experiences with women that make trust a little hard to come by.
What are your "my friend is a bridezilla" horror stories?	A few years ago, my best friend at the time invited me to attend her aunt's wedding. The day after I bought a dress to wear to the event, Bridezilla decided to un-invite me for no reason. As a high schooler who saved up the money for the dress on my own, I was so mad.	My best friend's coworker is getting married later this year, and oh, man, this girl's got some problems. She's very religious and "pure," which, if that's your thing, is fine. Whatever. However, she told my friend last week that **she doesn't want anyone at her wedding who was born out of wedlock**. Which includes my friend, who is the daughter of a teen mom.
Guys who've recently told someone you were dating that "this isn't working out": what reasons did you give her/him, and what were the REAL reasons?	Lol i feel bad but i told her she reminded me of my ex and i didn't wana deal. But really she had facial hair and it freaked me the hell out. Shallow but no regrets	**Told them:** I need stability and consistency in life and relationships. I love you, but I can't live without them. I think you love the person you thought I was or the person you thought you could turn me into, but I don't think you love me. I don't think we're compatible. **Kept to myself:** Being in a relationship with you is unpleasant. You are unpleasant. It feels like you are a different person wearing the skin of the person you presented yourself as when we started dating. Her, I miss. You, I never want to see again.
Fellow straight dudes, how many of you actually told your first time sexual partner that she was your first time? How many tried to act like you knew something? And how did it go?	She knew it was my first time and it was her's too. Wasn't much to hide given that we were each other's first date, first kiss, etc... It went reasonably well. There was lots of laughing because we didn't know what the fuck we were doing. After a few failed attempts to get it in, we managed. She didn't cum, I did, but she was happy we'd managed. Got better fast and before long we were fucking like bunnies. I was 18 and I think she 14? It was legal at the time, I was a Senior she was a Freshman and we had Romeo and Juliet laws where I was grew up.	I told her. She recoiled and wanted to have an (understandable) conversation about what sex meant to me, why I was a late stage virgin, etc. I imagine she just wanted to ensure that I wasn't going to get attached or harboring some sort of sexual trauma.
Have you ever received any backlash for dating someone considered "superior" to you (looks, class, race, personality, etc)? If so, what happened?	I don't go after people who are far more attractive than me. If a super pretty girl asked me on a date sincerely I would say no.	I've been married for almost 12 years, and I still often get "THAT's your husband??" when I introduce him to people. Ok yeah, he's a little better looking than me, but I'm not a troll, jeez. Not exciting, but that's pretty much it. Mostly I just make jokes about it.
My work just upgraded from Office 2003 to 2013. What's the last thing at your job you got excited about?	I walked into work, and there was a baby shower held for a few pregnant coworkers. There was Chick-fil-a and Chipotle catering. I thought I died and went to heaven.	I gave notice at my work because we were moving out to a new city across the country solely for the lower cost of living. My company asked me to stay on and work remotely. So now I make a good salary in a super cheap area plus I work from home in my pajamas with my cats. Prior to that it was probably when they got a Keurig and I could make so many teas and coffees and cocoas! But then they took that away and got a regular coffee pot, so that was a sad day.
What was your best purchase of 2017?	I got trashed the shitty old Christmas tree my grandparents gave me and bought a nice 8 ft tall one. I love it! Got it on clearance at the beginning of the year.	My cat, hands down. I'm counting her adoption fee as a 'purchase'. She's an idiot but she's my sweet idiot and I am so glad I have her.
How do you deal with losing friends in your 20's?	Get involved in your local dance scene. I started learning how to salsa a few years ago and found a community there. It's a great workout too.	I'm 39, and I think what you describe is extremely common. It just takes a lot more effort to maintain relationships as you get older. People get busy with their careers, advanced schooling, starting families, personal issues, etc. Friendships typically take a back seat to all those things. My advice would be to focus on the quality of your friendships, rather than the ~~quality~~ quantity. If you have even just one or two real friends, you can consider yourself pretty lucky. Getting old sucks. Edit: sorry for the typo.
Men who've been in a workplace setting where it was predominantly women and you were the minority, what was it like?	Ohh we had this inner circle of office bicycle's all married rooting anyone that pulls their dick out , that did the text guy's and do No Fucking work ? Yeah got a complaint about me that I abused her ? I told the boss it was because I rejected her advances .I don't go to clubs or drink alcohol in public , I'll have a beer at home if I want one . I was in a relationship at the time . She does zero work . And messes up everything she lays a hand on . That lady is not touching my me . I'm plenty messed up without any help thank you kindly . And I have never cheated , don't plan on starting soon . 😂 She was madder than a cut snake .	My experiences were all around positive. I used to work jewelry/ shoes at Walmart and clothes was right next to my department. Between them I was one of like 2 guys. There were a few younger girls but for the most part they were middle aged and up. They were some of the nicest coworkers. Yes, they wanted help with heavy and tall stuff, but they were always polite and I was happy to help. I had been losing weight and though I was still big they were always encouraging and would mention when I made progress. I think every work place is different, and luckily I had mostly good coworkers.
How many people have taken some time to be alone and not date for 6 - 12 months?	LOL. This thread basically shows how women have it easier in the dating game. You're actively choosing to stay single for a decided period of time? And then when all is better with yourself you'll go out and get into one again. While I've been single not by choice the entire time.	I haven't dated anyone in just over a year but not because of any conscious "I'm taking a break" decison, simply because I'm just not.
Have you ever had a prison pen pal? How did that go?	I was pen pals with a guy on death row. He was in the Latin Kings gang and ribbed a bank, shooting and killing a woman. He was very polite and a wonderful artist. He drew me a few pictures. We talked a little about his family and his day to day life and then I stopped writing. I still feel guilty. He's still alive so I might resume one day. Who knows.	My brother while he was in for about 2 years. He was using me, but I love him. The only time we ever really talk is when he's locked up.
Guys over 25 - do you find yourself comparing your life with friends from school?	I am the person people compare themselves to. I'm not trying to brag but after years of dedication and hard work I landed a great high paying job, bought a house, bought a dog, got engaged and bought a brand new BMW. This was all in the last 1 1/2 years. I believe I'm a nice guy, and genuinely will do anything to help anyone. I smile a lot and try to make everyone feel happy. It fills me with pride to know I'm doing well in my own life and it makes me feel even prouder when I can help some body else. I'm 26.	Everyone asks each other what you do. That's pretty standard question for someone that you haven't seen in forever. Most people at my age (25) though aren't concerned with success as much as they're afraid they're going to end up old and alone with 50 cats. I'm at the age when the first round of people in my cohort are getting engaged and married
AM, have any of you dipped your pen in company ink? How did it turn out?	No. I've never been attracted to any guy I've worked with, and even if I was I'm not that stupid. Plenty of other guys in the world.	Sort of I guess. When I worked st the hospital a nursing secretary and I had a thing going on for a month or two. Got oral pretty much every day after work for a while. Was a good few months until she went back with her ex. No real relationship and no drama. 10/10.
Single men, do you ever go through a phase where you become a robot, do what you need to do to survive and no interest in anything else?	Holly duck. Wait till you get married, you become the fat version of the T2000. The best time in your life is now. Old enough to be independent and earning $. No commitment or responsibility to tie you down. Freedom	Yeah currently living like this, feels like I’m on autopilot and all I think about is work since it’s the only thing going on in my life.
Would you want your fiancé to wear an engagement ring too?	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders of your partners. This question is not limited to women who date men.	Please feel free to respond regardless of the genders of your partners. This question is not limited to women who date men.
Homosexual men, is domestic violence as big an issue for homosexual couples as it is for heterosexual ones?	Domestic violence in same-sex relationships occurs with about the same frequency as it does in opposite-sex relationships, but it tends to be reported less and there are fewer resources available for victims. Also, we prefer the term gay, just so you know.	It can be. My first boyfriend broke a few of my bones, and I've called the cops on him. This was like... 10+ years ago though.
How do you really get over someone?	time. i ended up everything with my ex one year ago and i closed full contact. 1 week ago she was in my town and needed to give me a bag so we went and had dinner together as friends. she has a cute thing that is calling me by my name when shes about to ask me something silly, and she would make this sweet voice and laugh. she did it at dinner to ask me to drive my car, and last year i would melt and love that little smile... 2 weeks ago i felt nothing, that's how i knew i was over her :) also we went to my house so she could meet my new cat and had sex twice but after that we remained friends and i know i dont love her anymore lol	There are no cheats. Time heals all. Perspective. If you have a habit of checking how they are doing - break it. No contact is the tried and trusted method, if that’s not possible, be cordial.
For those of us that never really had nice things, how did you get rid of that feeling of “waiting for the other shoe to drop” when you actually had something nice?	It was a slow, gradual process. When I was a kid I ate gubba'mint cheese and powdered milk. Mom made almost no money (and I think she was bad at personal finance). It took years, some ups and downs, but I got to the point where I realized I saved up for vacations and purchases ahead of time. I have six different whoops/emergency funds. I am going to pay my house off early. I made a great salary. Now and then I'll still find myself doing poor people stuff, tho. Cobbling a ghetto dinner together out of random shit in the fridge because I've mentally calculated the price per meal ... or refusing to buy coffee at home because it's free at work, etc.	The thing is the other shoe is always going to drop. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. You need to just take the moment to appreciate things while they're good and not worry about the things that are bad until they happen. Some planning for misfortune is a good thing, but always worrying about it is not. Nothing stays perfect forever. Trying to exercise control over everything never actually works. Just try to appreciate it when things work out because it's temporary. The problems will show up on their own concentrate your efforts on making the good things happen.
Single ladies: What is your monthly salary? Do you feel like you can live comfortably on it?	I am "single" in marriage terms but live with my boyfriend. I am a teacher and barely make ends meet with splitting bills with him. I would not be able to afford to live on my own with my current student loan payments, car payments and shitty paychecks. I do not live in an expensive city. We have very affordable housing here. Idk how some women do it either.	I earn $3kish a month. I have side gigs so my monthly income is variable between $3k and $4k. Honestly, I have an easier time meeting my budget when single than when in a relationship. In a relationship, there is a lot more entertainment spending and spending to indicate fondness that you simply don't have to do when single. No date nights. No Netflix subscription. And no one else's spending habits to compromise to humor.
Women who were forced to carry a pregnancy to term after being denied an abortion (any trimester), what were your experinces and what is your current relationship with your child?	Man, all of these stories are nice and all but I strongly detest children, the idea of me personally parenting and am tokiphobic as hell. If I was denied an abortion (which hopefully I won't be, I have a normal period, money saved up, and am a normal weight) I honestly think the shock would lead me to suicide. Even with adoption I don't think I could handle 9 months of pregnancy.	I was the child and my mother and I never had a close or healthy relationship. Lacked affection and much of a bond. Sucks.
Have you ever spooned/shared a bed with a girl who just wanted to be friends?	Always make a move, the worst you can get is a no. At which point you boot her to the couch.	Ah dude, this is all sorts of awkward. Honestly, if she is a really good friend you need to avoid making a move. It is easy to say (as /u/ChiefmoBaggins said) that "the worst you can get is a no" but I disagree - you can ruin a friendship. Save making a move for the clear light of day where you can judge if she is flirting with you better.
To what degree do you think the notion of "sex dies after marriage" is true? What do you think are the causes for it?	Many people use sex as a tool to obtain and secure a relationship. For these people, the more secure the relationship, the less need for them to continue to have sex. Exclusivity is more secure than casual dating; engaged is more secure than exclusivity; married is more secure than engaged; having kids is more secure than just married.	From the 1977 movie "Annie Hall", which stars Woody Allen as Alvy Singer and Diane Keaton as Annie Hall. -------------------------------------------- ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST: How often do you sleep together? ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST: Do you have sex often? ALVY: Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week. ANNIE: Constantly! I'd say three times a week.
A girl whom I could have slept with but didn't just posted a picture of herself in a schoolgirl outfit. Which "what if"s keep you up at night?	is there really a point in thinking about what ifs? you make your decisions judging by what you feel is best for you at that time so there is nothing to feel bad about. you want sex? rub one out and with new clarity ask yourself what made you not sleep with her in the first place. for example if you didn't because you had a relationship already. good for you you are not a total asshole. if it was because she had a odd personality quirk. good for you never stick your dick in crazy. if it was simply because it wasn't the right time, well you always have priorities that come first that's life. move on	Honestly? Steel. Specifically, how to make steel. Had this weird late night *"what if I get sent back in time to the upper neolithic"* thought and I lay in bed for hours thinking about it, and the thing that most concerned me was that I didn't know how to make steel. So eventually I caved, booted up the PC and googled it; only after that was I able to sleep.
Women, have you every tried the menstrual cup, if so how'd it work for you?	I hope it's ok I comment as I'm not a woman but, my wife has 2 of the divas and swears by them now... no more cotton... I have actually seen a change in her mood ever since. Much happier and way more comfortable now. She said " omg I cant even feel it in there! ". She highly recommends them. They look crazy to me but if it works it works... no leaks either...	Yep! I like using the diva cup. It took a little while to get the hang of it and some trial and error to get it to seal properly but now it's my go-to over tampons if I know I'll be home when I need to empty it.
What male stereotype pisses you off the most?	Male privilege, implying that female privilege doesn't exist and we are somehow better off in society. Just last week the wife was going on about how in 1945 French women got the vote and how that was so late. She didn't care much for me pointing out that men had just been forced to die by the millions.	I hate the dumb, fat, bumbling, horny TV dad. I may be all of those sometimes, but not all at once.
Single men, how often do you go out by yourself? Women, how do you view men alone versus in a group?	As a man, when you go out alone it's possible to be left alone except when you want someone to interact with. That's not really true of most women. Similarly, if I go to a bar & get toasty alone, I don't have to worry about getting hit on, drugged, or for the most part taken advantage of while blacked out. Being a man is like having a super power.	I would be way more willing to approach a guy on his own than in a group. I see a group as, "We came here together to enjoy each others company, not yours." And, a person solo as "I wanted to go out and socialize, just didn't have anyone to do so with tonight." But, I probably see it that way because that's how I am about going out solo. Even if I'm in a group, I'm happy to meet new people :) Edit: I need to stop using voice to text, or check it well afterwards.
To those who are gay, at what age did you know?	I wonder why people don't ask at what age straight people knew they were straight as much. Or to ask generally at what age did people know their orientation without specifying the orientation.	11, I had a brief period (about 6 months) where I tried to deny it but then I started watching Six Feet Under with my parents and I accepted it. I've never tried to pretend I was bi or try to be straight. I did remain in the closet until I was 16 though and I've been a big homo ever since.
Dealing with codependency?	In short, it sounds like you others to care for your emotional wellbeing without giving a damn about theirs. And, no, unless you live in a shack in the central Nevada desert, or a small cabin on the Alaskan frontier or are otherwise cut off from human contact, you can't really say that you just rely on yourself and yourself alone.	from my perspective as an independent dealing with the same thing: it's incompatibility. it definitely is in my case, at least. but I would postulate it is for you also. How to deal: tell them that it isn't working out the way you want it to and move on. if they push the issue, bring up needing more space and independent time and that while normally, communicating is an endearing trait, the way that they are doing is turning you off heavily.
Did you take your spouse's last name? Why or why not?	Dont want to be married, but if I ever did, I would not take his last name. Im not becoming his property. It's archaic as fuck. So much shit around marriage and weddings is archaic, and gross in my opinion. Man asking the womens father for permission. Father "giving away" the daughter, transferring her owndership to the husband to be, so she takes his last name as she belongs to him. Gross.	I did, yeah. My maiden name is that of a fish. My husband's last name is hispanic and pretty badass, tbh. I jumped at the chance to have a cool last name.
What skill unrelated to your profession would you want to learn or improve at?	Can we get the mods to just stop adding tags to posts here? Being a mod is supposed to be about supporting the community and the information flow, not soap boxing about your own personal opinions. Yes this is a good question. How is it helpful to the community to have that as a tag on this post?	I would like to learn how to work on cars and motorbikes. Anything mechanical actually. I have a boring ass desk job... Edit: guys thanks so much for the advice, some real good stuff in there and I'll definitely start a project now. Better buy some tools! 👊
What are some things that you are trying to improve about yourself right now?	Two main focuses for me right now: 1. Relearning JavaScript and a new framework (react.js) to re-enter the workforce as a web developer after being a stay at home mom for 4 years. I’m nervous at finding a new tech job at 30 but hopeful! 2. Gaining better control over my emotions and strengthening my ability to not take things so personally, but rather learn and grow from criticism. This one has been really difficult.	Say out loud when something bothers me, giving more positive feedback to my SO, handling the rejections, defining my feminity while accepting and emphasizing it.
What cheap, healthy meals do you like to make on the regular?	Not a meal, but I like to snack on carrots. I buy them cheap, the really big ones in a 10lbs bag and cut them small, 2,3 carrots per day and snack all day at school (I take breaks though, to make sure I’m not turning orange:)	I mix one avacado with one can of tuna. Add black pepper. Tastes awesome and has a ton of protein and Omega fatty acids. Super quick and filling, great for a busy lifestyle. I personally prefer Skipjack tuna over all else.
What are some common fuck-ups I can avoid for my first job?	Punch someone the very first hour you're there to assert dominance. Pee in a corner of the office. Bark every time someone goes near it or talks about it. Hire a lawyer and hit the gym, it'll make you feel good. Don't go on social media for a while. You should see a doctor about it. Dress for the job you want, not the one you have. Amazon has great prices in Batman masks this week.	Stay out of any office drama/gossip. And keep your personal life mostly personal until you really know people. Good luck!
Why would you stay friends with a rapist if you knew what he had done (and knew it really did happen)?	Nope, never. The rub of it, though, is that innocent til proven guilty. If we strung up every guy accused of rape, we'd be left with Pope Francis and a bunch of screamingly obvious gay men. EDIT: I'm not saying rape isn't a serious issue, I'm saying if I don't know, I've no business second guessing. Once it's known and convicted slam dunk, dude's so written off.	Fuck no. I would have cut them off from my life instantly. Especially since you even showed proof and it wasn't a pure he said/she said situation.
Gentlemen of Reddit, what's the weirdest reason you aren't someone's "type"?	I treated her too well, she was having feelings (because apparently all of her exes were douche-bags), and couldn't take a married guy home to meet mom.	I was once flirting with a girl in a bar when I was 19 amd she was 20 or 21. The topic of age came up in conversation. She estimated me to be about 23, and when I told her the truth she excused herself and said she would never date a younger guy. I find that a very odd idea, especially given that she clearly seemed interested before when she thought I was older...
Have you ever, despite feeling lonely, avoided dating because you didn't consider yourself worth dating? What made you feel that way? How did you cope?	Yeah, low self-confidence is a shitty thing. I just focused on myself - my mental health, my diet. I'm of the belief that if you don't truly love yourself, nothing's going to work. Other people aren't the answer to making you happy. YOU have to make you happy. And once you're good, then other people can make you happier.	Yeah, low self-confidence is a shitty thing. I just focused on myself - my mental health, my diet. I'm of the belief that if you don't truly love yourself, nothing's going to work. Other people aren't the answer to making you happy. YOU have to make you happy. And once you're good, then other people can make you happier.
Ladies, what do you donate to?	Nothing, because I know that charities will just use most of the money for themselves and then use maybe about 5% of the money for the actual cause.	I can't give money, so I give my blood. ETA If I ever were to live in the states again and able to donate, I'd give actual GOOD food to pantries. So many heartbreaking stories of kids having to choke down disgusting canned meat products on Thanksgiving. If you wouldn't eat it, be kind and don't make it someone's only choice.
How often do you think about fucking those around you?	I make this same fucking argument all the time here. FtM transgenders always report this once they start hormone replacement. Yet, everytime I say men and women are different, and that men have a MUCH higher sex drive than women I'm downvoted. To answer your question, yeah pretty much I do.	It happens very often, but it is a fleeting thought. For example, when I walk to work (I work in a city) I will see an attractive woman walking towards me. I will look at her, the thought of her as attractive, sexy, or bang-able passes through my mind, and then its gone. This will happen most times I see a woman, but its a fleeting thought, much like when you see a fancy car. You see it, acknowledge its nice, and then the thought is gone. Very very rarely does the thought progress beyond that or last more than a moment.
What is the biggest obstacle you and you SO have faced in your relationship?	Our mental illnesses. Adhd H, Bpd, depression and anxiety - Me Adhd C, depression and anxiety - My husband, Adhd H, Depression, anxiety, possible bipolar - My boyfriend. (we are poly) yeah, we are a fun mixed bag, add one toddler.	He was unemployed, which led to depression and strong feelings of inadequacy. This lasted about a year. I tried to be supportive both financially and emotionally but it was very difficult.
How big is your social circle?	It's not something I consciously quantify. Best I could do is break it down broadly into categories. **Besties:** Maybe 5? **People I would want to hang out with 1-on-1:** Perhaps another 10 or so people. **People I see regularly in non 1-on-1 situations:** ~30? **People I interact with regularly on social media:** ~another 10 **People I don't necessary interact with regularly but still consider a friend:** ~30? (includes school friends, for instance) My preference would be for more 1:1 friends, but I've expanded my wider social group in the last few years which I'm quite happy about.	All but one of my friends are coworkers. I'm not sure why you are disallowing coworkers and roommates from being friends of people that want to answer. IME, coworkers have ended up being my closest friends.
Victims of child abuse: What happened and how are you now?	Victim of childhood sex abuse: I repressed all the memories until about seven months ago when I finally quit drinking after 20 years as an alcoholic. All the memories and emotions came flooding back, some in vivid flashbacks. I'm still processing it all with a therapist. I've struggled with depression since adolescence, and now I can add anxiety and PTSD to that mix. As bad as it sounds, I'm doing pretty good though. Good days and bad. At least I'm sober and learning to deal with life on life's terms.	My brothers father used to treat me not-so-great the year or so we lived with him. I was around 8-9 and would wet the bed every so often and when he got home from work in the early morning around 2 or 3am he'd pull me out of bed and have me handwash my sheets while standing behind me saying how dirty I was. He'd 'teach' me self-defence where he'd put me in a painful hold and not let me go until I was in tears begging him to let go... Stuff like that. I'm 26 now and still find it hard to trust older men. Edit; Thank you kind stranger for the gild, and to those that replied to my comment. It means a lot to be heard.
Below average/unattractive guys, how did you start your FWB relationship?	There's no reasonable course of action for an unattractive guy when it comes to dating in any form. Either you make yourself attractive in some way, even if the audience you're aiming for is very narrow or you're fucked.	Yes. An aside; work on what you can work on. Physique and how you dress are the easiest. The hard part is building your confidence, thats a whole nother discussion that is a big ol can o worms. Oh and if you're just looking for a FWB, lower your standards...a lot. You never know when someone you wouldn't think about hooking up with will do it for you in the sack.
Ladies who grew up during the 2000s, what makes you nostalgic about that time period?	I was born in 2000. I remember a lot of the music, Silly Bandz, Disney Channel Originals (Cheetah Girls and High School Musical), Webkinz, spaghetti strap tank tops and low rise jeans with rhinestones, and CD-ROM games.	I miss Neopets. I don't even remember the email I used for my account (it was my dad's), so my poor pets are probably starving. :( Oh! And listening to Hilary Duff songs on Radio Disney. I had all her CD's.
Men in their 30s, what advice would you give to 25 - 29 year olds?	If you haven't figured it out by 28, you're probably not gonna figure it out at the magical age of 32 or whatever 30 number.. By 25 you should pretty much have shit squared away.	Stop treating girls like they're special before they actually are. This isn't to say that girls aren't special, but a girl shouldn't be special *to you* until you have a relationship with her. I spent too many years of my life pining after girls I wasn't dating and who wouldn't date me if I asked. Date first, then find out if they're special or not.
What's the male version of "Basic" in your opinion?	- obsessively talks about breaking bad/dexter/the walking dead - sloppy, ill fitting clothes his mom probably bought for him at Marshall's - spends hours a day gaming and considers it a core hobby - loves taco bell - proud about his atheist belief systems, probably a libertarian and will let you know about it. - "ironic" racism/sexism	Since "basic" is basically synonymous with average college to young adult ladies, basic for dudes would be * Gym shorts, sweatpants over gym shorts. Layer them just so, so that boxers, and gym shorts can be seen peeking over the sweatpants * Nike sandals, (those single strap velcro ones) * Nike Crew length socks. Especially with shorts! and those sandals. * NIKE FREE 5.0's!!! * North Face Apex Jacket / North Face Denali Jacket * Shaker Bottles or carrying around a full gallon of water. *bonus points for those wierd sippy water cooler ones * Ray Bans / Knockoff Ray Bans * American Eagle Jeans * Loves chanting "USA USA USA" * Snapbacks with the sticker left on * Sperrys * Formal events? Blazer with jeans and sunglasses. *edited to add a few things. I'm making this list thinking about my dear basic brother.
What’s something that your SO doesn’t know about you that could jeopardise your relationship?	Nothing. We're married, so if I thought anything could potentially end the relationship I would've told him before we got married. Theres nothing I wouldn't tell him.	I’m always conflicted about when to share the fact that I have bipolar disorder. Too early on and it’s unwelcome TMI. Too late and it gets misleading. So in the beginning, it feels like I’m holding on to a secret. But the reason I don’t feel bad waiting is because it’s pretty much a non-issue in my life. There’s a lot of misinformation about bipolar out there. People conflate it with personality disorders like borderline personality disorder and use it to mean “has volatile moods” when that’s not it at all. I also have zero symptoms since I’m on meds, so it doesn’t affect my life at all. Still, it’s their prerogative whether or not it’s a dealbreaker once I tell them.
Got sucker punched by a girl. Can I press charges or is it too petty of a crime?	As a woman, I find that shirt pretty offensive (though I would probably find humor in it in the right setting). I do, however, find her behavior far more offensive. It's women like that that give feminism the stigma it has. That being said, I think you need to report it. People can't just go around punching people, life isn't a video game.	That would classify as assault, I think. Talk about it to the police, straight up punching someone isn't a petty thing, even if no harm was done. That said, I wanna know what the text on the shirt was.
What's something someone has said off hand that crumbled your self-esteem seemingly permanently as an adult?	I remember one of my closest friends called me a "loser" one night and we didnt talk much for a few years after. She blamed me for being too sensitive, which yes I'm a cancer, we're sensitive people. We're friends again now and we're actually suppose to hang but i never quite got over it, and i think it was right there that I learned you can know someone for years but when push comes to shove you better love your own damn self because they probably really don't have your back the way you think/want them to. Edit: guys get off my damn crab shell 🦀🦀 i dont care what you think 95% of yall wear cargo shorts	A coworker once wrote and recorded a song about me. In it he attacked my receding hairline, my looks, and my sexuality.
Dear sisters of reddit, I am the older sister to a 13 year old girl and I desperately need advice. Please help?	I'm not female, and I'm not a parent, but does it ever work to call bratty little girls on their crap and not let them weasel their way out of immaturity? As in, 'you're being disrespectful, you have no good reason to, and you know it. cut the shit and act like the age you want to be treated.'	As an older sister to a real crazy one, I can say that you have to appreciate the shit out of her good moments and do your best to ride out the bad ones. It can be hard not to take it personally when she takes shit out on you, but remember that she loves you and she's just high on puberty hormones. Though my sister is almost 19 and she's still a nut case half the time. edit, more advice: Don't try to involve yourself in her bullshit- if she's being crazy, steer clear. It's sort of a big-sister-ly instinct to want to help her with her problems but sometimes it's better to not get involved. If she comes to you with something, that's one thing, but otherwise you should offer your opinions on her life sparingly.
Any of you in your 20's or up and don't have a drivers license if so why and how's it affecting you?	20 here. I tell people it's because I like speeding and I'd rather solve the problem at the source than control myself. I also don't trust people on the street, I hate red lights and a car brings a lot of problems (parking places, red lights, other assholes driving, etc). True reason is, I've never had the money to pay for the driving lessons nor the time for it. My dream is to drive a motorcycle.	20 YO, no license. I'm from NYC, so I never really felt the need to drive. Sure, it'll cut my travel time, but the train works just fine for now. And I don't have to worry about parking.
Men of Reddit, how can I stop blaming my lack of success with women on physical factors I can't change (height, race, etc) and accept personal responsibility?	I’ll be real. As a ladyperson™️ I feel like a lot of men forget that women aren’t just blindly interested in men the more hot they are on some imaginary sliding scale, and that’s the only factor that matters. Yes, physical factors are important, but you said it yourself- factors. A lot of why you like another person has nothing to do with their looks. People still like and love other people that may not be “10s”. Basically my point is, since you can’t change these things about yourself, stop fucking worrying about it because nobody else is. Women are attracted to interesting people who they enjoy being around, so maybe focus on being more interesting or something?	Start doing things that improve the factors you *can* control. The more you make progress on the things you can control, the less you will care about the things you can't. This is not going to be a simple mindset change or willpower exercise. It will require action, but the positive feelings will follow. EDIT: I want to toss a shoutout to /u/complextelemachus's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/8wb19y/men_of_reddit_how_can_i_stop_blaming_my_lack_of/e1u9jh3/) below, which is very well thought out and presents some great ideas. I think it deserves more credit in this thread.
Mothers of reddit - why exactly am I not supposed to sit on the arm of the couch?	I'm a mom and I sit on the arms of the couch. My husband says you're not supposed to sit there or put weight on the back of the couch because it could break, but he might be full of it.	Not a mom, but I just bought my first couch and it's something about not wanting to make it bow or otherwise compromise the structure over time. (That's what the person selling it said anyway) ...And after realizing just how dang much furniture costs, I completely understand why my parents freaked out over things like using coasters now. Furniture is important and expensive.
Ever find out one of your best friends may be a wife beater? How did you handle it?	I stayed the fuck out of it, and so should you. You'll never know the truth, and that's what the law is for. If he keeps trying to argue you onto his side, say "Dude, I always thought the way you guys fought was unhealthy and childish. I have no idea if you beat her up or not, and I'll never know for sure. My advice is to get out of the relationship, take a long, hard look at how you allowed such an unhealthy relationship dynamic to develop, and don't do that again in the future."	God no. What kind of person thinks it's normal for people to break dishes or flip over furniture or *wrestle* when they have an argument?
What's something you own that you would never have bought for yourself, but are SO grateful that someone gifted it to you?	Oh gosh, SO much... A lot of my stuffed animals from my fiancé, a smart TV, we went splitsies on a record player, a resume portfolio, and my wireless headphones. The headphones are the best thing ever, holy shit.	A kindle. I always read a lot and was super anti-kindle because I loved books. My mom bought me a Kindle for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely love it. I can get any book I want within minutes, and most books for free from the library while I'm just sitting at home. Also, I can bring a billion books with me wherever I go and it takes up almost no space. I also have arthritis in my hands so holding a book open gets painful for me after a few minutes but the kindle is really easy to hold!
We often hear of women's experiences with men in the workplace.Men of Reddit, what have been your experiences (good or bad) with women in the workplace?	99% of bad experiences I've had with female coworkers or bosses were bad because they were bad, not because of the gender of the person involved.	I'm pretty sure everyone at my job is way more politically correct and professional at work than they are in real life. It's to a point where I don't feel like I truly can get to know anyone. So there are no issues with anyone at my job.
How do you get excited about your life when things aren't all that exciting?	You get used it to. Life is rarely exciting. Thank goodness. Excitement takes a lot of energy. It wears you out--both body and soul. After awhile, it seems, you learn to enjoy the calm routine. Take pleasure in the smaller moments.	I keep a list on my phone of little things I love, and I read it when I need a pick me up. Sure, life isn't all exciting adventures and glamorous vacations, but damn it if Saturday morning pancakes aren't the best things ever. Or a good boob day. Or the way my dog sits like a human sometimes.
Where do you live and what are the pros and cons?	I live just outside of a decent-sized city in the midwest (of the US). Pros: - Cost of living! My rent is so ridiculously low. - The city is so pro-kids. We have some amazing kid-focused destinations. And the whole culture is very kid-focused. - Lots of fat people (so I don't stand out) - No mountains! I hate mountains. - The summers are wonderfully mild (compared to when I lived in the oppressive I'm-gonna-wear-this-humid-air-as-my-outfit-for-the-day South) - Hardly any traffic (as compared to coastal cities) Cons: - Snow. So much god damn snow. - Potholes. - Such conservatism, it's embarrassing. - No beach. :( - The public transportation sucks monkey balls.	Paris, France. Pros : Beautiful. Easy access to everything I like and need, especially culture. Don't need a car, I walk past Notre-Dame every day, good food everywhere, family and friends around. Cons : Overcrowded. Expensive. Took me a year to find a job again.
Gentlemen, what's your go-to solution for being with a girl who likes being loud in bed without annoying your flatmates?	Tell her to shut the fuck up; it’s really not hard to be respectful of other people in the house. When you can be loud, be loud; when you can’t, don’t I am seriously turned off by people who don’t have concern/respect for others and a chick who was incapable of recognizing that might not last long	ASK her if she wants you to cover her mouth with your hand. I’ll do that if I’m targeting from the behind. Just wrap your hand around her mouth and let her moan in your hand. HANDS work. But always ask when doing that. Some women don’t like that
Got $19 left on my Amazon certificate, what's a must-have item for a college guy?	Alright dude, you have everything you need apparently so just save the credit until something occurs to you that you can't foresee. Or maybe use it to buy somebody a birthday or Christmas gift when you need to.	Decorations for your room - they make things way more comfortable. Especially as a girl, I liked seeing a man's room a bit decorated. I recommend getting curtain lights, small speakers, partially paying for a cheap projector (so you can watch movies on the wall with girls and not hover around a small TV or laptop). Even a little plant (chia pet) would be cool
Women who wanted children but dreaded pregnancy, how did it go for you?	I had my first (and only kid) at 33, up to that point I hadn't wanted children, damn biological clock! I knew from the get-go he was a boy and it was going to be an awful pregnancy. I had a multitude of medical problems, in and out of the Mat wards, saw every single consultant going and had a rough time. I had a 40 hour labour, his head was stuck in my pelvis and he was wedged against my back, I had an emergency c-section in the end. Never again. Edit: I was pregnant for 42 weeks, I felt like an elephant and I was going to die pregnant.	I felt great pregnant! A little sleepy at the beginning, and huge at the end but other than that totally fine. I taught over 10 ballet classes a week until the day before I pushed my little girl out at almost 43 weeks....I did completely lose my mind between 41 and 42 weeks. I honestly thought I might be pregnant forever. But I wasn't, labor was quick and doable and now I have a little wild girl. My brightest light.
What is the most ridiculous thing that guys are taught about dating/relationships in our society?	To be nice to women. Now nice guys are the laughing stock of the dating scene and girls would rather be with a woman beater	Not sure if it's a common thing or if I'm just a minority, but I grew up thinking that by expressing interest in a woman I was being offensive, so there's that.
Fit men of askmen, what are you eating today?	You don't need to eat healthy to maintain your weight. Maintaining is easy. Most fit only eat semi healthy unless you're eating for performance purposes. Losing weight? Completely different story.	Had oatmeal with berries this AM. Eating some almonds and walnuts at the moment. Lunch will be chicken and veggies. Dinner will be tilapia and stir fried veggies with a glass of wine.
Solo female travelers of Reddit, what tips, advice, or warnings do you have for females traveling alone for the first time?	I have been to 4 continents, 25+ countries including the Middle East. My only advice is to not listen to too much advice but follow your heart. I walk around in tank tops and skirts at night and I am fine. I recommend self-esteem, a confident posture and no fears but rather excitement for the adventures ahead.	Practice resting bitchface. My default public persona is 'on the way to do a murder', and it's served me well.
1.) Who was your high school crush?	Haha, my high school crush was this dude who was super super into professional wrestling and swearing a lot. I'm embarrassed to think of it.	LOL, high school JoyfulStingray did not have only ONE crush. She crushed hard, became disinterested when they didn't show interest, then crushed hard on the next boy who talked to her.
Why is the slang "cunt" considered as unutterable as it is, in the U.S.A.?	FWIW, I'm a white, cis, hetero, American male. My limited understanding is that "cunt" is offensive largely because it's mainly used to describe women in our society. And to reduce women to their 'cunts' — i.e. their mechanism for sex and reproduction — taps into the sources of misogyny that have oppressed women since ever. Calling a woman a 'walking vagina' is just horribly dehumanizing. Sure, Aussies call men 'cunts', but I get the feeling that when Americans call men 'cunts', it's a deliberately foreign idea — like calling a toilet a 'loo'. You just wouldn't call a man a cunt, like you wouldn't call a woman a 'dick'. But that's just my experience.	How insensitive does someone have to be to call someone else a genital name? I mean what a bunch of dicks
How much cash is a good amount to carry around in your wallet?	On a regular basis: None. I don't like cash, it's more of an inconvenience than anything. If I'm going somewhere where I need cash, or say, going out to the bars for the evening: $100.	I usually have ~£20 in my wallet, unless I'm going on a night out in which case it's generally closer to £50-60, because paying by card in a club is insanity.
I see a whole lot of articles about "why women wear makeup" but what about "why women don't wear makeup"?	Makeup is whatever you want it to be. You can have a makeup routine that takes an hour and uses tons of expensive products, or you can have a makeup routine that takes 1 minute and uses two or three cheap products from the drugstore. You can choose to wear elaborate eyeshadow and heavy foundation, or you can choose to dab some concealer on a pimple and powder your nose. So I don't think there's a sharp distinction between "wearing makeup" and "not wearing makeup."	My personal friends wear makeup for two main reasons: they genuinely enjoy putting it on, and/or it makes them feel more confident. I don't wear makeup for two main reasons: I genuinely hate applying it, and it makes me feel more insecure because I'm so used to my face without makeup that I feel clownish with it on.
Do you immediately imagine people having sex once they announce that they are pregnant?	I get flashes of them 20 years later with kids that don't talk to them, bills piling up, and their entire life still on hold while they pay off college debt. It's not a good look. All I can think of is "Why would you do that to yourself?"	Totally. Also, every time I'm at a wedding: "These people are going to have sex tonight. They are cutting cake in preparation of having intercourse."
What is the most ridiculous thing a healthcare professional has told you?	Not me but my mom. She has hypothyroidism and has trouble losing weight and keeping it off. She went in to see a doctor before she was diagnosed with it and he told her "whatever you're eating, eat half of that. I guarantee you'll lose weight." Meanwhile she generally eats pretty healthy and about two meals a day. She does not overeat *at all.* She was too stunned to tell him to go fuck himself so she didn't. But if I were there I would be left and refused to pay for that "service."	Could not wrap her head around the fact that I was sexually active, wasn't trying to get pregnant, but wasn't on birth control. Knew I had a female partner. I mean...
What are some things that are really important to you when looking for a new apartment (or house) that aren't immediately obvious things to look out for?	Lots of windows and water that stays hot for a LONG time The current apartment I'm in; the water fricking stays warm for 12 minutes on a good day. I have thick long hair down to my butt crack. Needless to say 12 minutes does NOT suffice and most of showers no allll of my showers end cold.	Practice your commute to work! If you're "against" or "with" traffic, the sunrise/ sunset can make life hellish or much better! Also, make phone calls/ use your phone in each spot in the place to make sure you get service. I lived in a place where my phone didn't work and I had to sit on the outside steps to make phone calls - it was so so so beyond aggravating
Guys who never developed confidence, have you ever managed to be with women? If so, how?	i did get laid a fair number of times back when i had no confidence at all, but that's because i'm good looking enough that a few brave girls pursued me. most guys don't have this luxury, so i suggest yall get to work and get out of your pathetic little comfort zones. sorry to be harsh, but that's the bleak truth.	Well, get ready for a barrage of "fake it till you make it" comments. I for one will not hinder you with such a comment. I don't see many admitting to getting laid without having confidence. I am curious to the comment that will roll in though.
Whelp, I just read a job posting for an "entry level" position that required 4-6 years of experience. I'm done for the day. What's boggled your mind and/or frustrated you today, AW?	You guys are so supportive of each other. As a man, when I have a shitty day, I get to "console" myself with the fact that no one cares. Sure, if something absolutely life changingly horrible happens, I have plenty of people to turn to for support. But just everyday average shittiness? I've got no one.	I was just ranting about this today. 4 year degree? 2+ years experience? Great! We will pay you slightly over minimum wage! Ugh.
People who adopted sick, neglected or "difficult" pets, what are your stories?	Also, pet tax please :D Here are my two cats, [Jack](https://imgur.com/a/v3tPt#0) (warning: mildly graphic) and [Shusha](https://i.imgur.com/nlsYpVr.gif) (picked him up off the street after he got mangled - badly - by a car). Share your stories! :)	My dog is a Craigslist find. Totally malnourished, and he had such bad fleas that he had wounds and hairless patches all over from scratching. He was so underweight that the vet wouldn't give him his vaccines yet. It took 3 months for me to get him to the minimum weight. He was surprisingly docile, which leads me to believe he wasn't technically "abused," just that his previous owner was unable to afford him. She was a pregnant teen that lived on her own in the low income part of town and already had a baby, 2 dogs, and like 4 cats. This was my first dog ever, and I really couldn't have asked for a smarter, sweeter dog. I don't have a photo of him right now but I may be able to post one later.
How do you feel about "breastaurants" like hooters, twin peaks, etc.?	I walked into the Denver Tilted Kilt a few weeks ago because I read they had a good beer menu (they do!) I was quite surprised to find out that it was one of *those* places. The waitress flirted too much. But she might have been on something. Anyway, it was the best fish and chips I've ever had. Combination of food/beer/prices means I'll probably go back . I don't think the titties made a difference	>What is the female perception of these restaurants? I think the concept is pretty gross. >Have you ever eaten or worked there? I ate at a tilted kilt. Never again. >How do you feel about the women who work there? You do you. >What about the men who eat there? You do you. I'm not going. >Do you think working there would be demeaning or empowering? Neither. Its just a job, not a POWERFUL STATEMENT ON WOMENING.
Women who cheated on your SO, but don't regret it, what's your story?	I cheated on every partner I had for the first 20 years of dating - either emotionally or sexually (usually both). I don't regret it because regretting things is a waste of my time and energy. To note: I've now been polyamorous for 5+ years and this is a much better system for me.	We both moved away for uni and were really far apart and I felt and I was feeling vulnerable in a new place. I felt bad but didn't regret it. Stopped feeling bad when I found out he did the same. In retrospect we should have broken up as we both knew we hated long distance relationships but neither has the balls to say it. Still don't regret it and still don't feel bad but fully acknowledge the immaturity and trashiness of the whole situation. Real learning curve
How to walk the fine line between waiting for sex until you're sure he's not playing you and avoiding alienating a guy who's genuinely interested?	If he's worthwhile and truly interested then he will be happy to wait until you are 100% comfortable, end of story. Another question might be, are you looking for a relationship with someone who will date other women and be a charming player type with them too?	I'll come at this from another angle: I've never known a man to tell me that he met an amazing, beautiful, considerate, sensible woman with a great personality and upstanding character - and they only stuck around to stick it in. My advice: focus on being the best you can be and providing the relationship the best you can offer. The rest will pan out however it was going to anyway. Plenty of guys sleep with women and then bail when they can't stand their character anymore. Be the chick that a guy wants to sleep with and then stick with afterwards because they're just so damn great.
Found Tinder running on my BF's phone. How should I handle this?	Check his messages and see if any are current. Sometimes people just forget about it, or they just like to see who is interested in them. I have since deleted my dating apps since "being taken off the market"	How about "So, I'm worried about something I saw on your phone when I was killing the GPS app... I found Tinder. What do you with that app? Do I need to be concerned with anything?" I guess knowing how long you have been dating might help context a bit.
What are your lesser-known tips for improving your appearance?	Keeping your body fat % relatively low. Studies show that women are most attracted to men around 10% body fat, as it signals a strong immune system.	Say you have to be out the door at 7. AM, PM, doesn't matter. I can get dressed in 10 minutes if I'm being slow. However, if I get dressed at 6:50, I usually end up making mistakes, not looking over myself more carefully. Get ready at least 30 minutes before going out.
Why are you still single?	Because in 2019 women are a liability and no one can act like a reasonable adult and be an honest person.	Low self esteem, not all that attractive imo, and general anxiety and depression. I wanna better myself before finding someone, but every girl (the ones I’ve tried meeting at least) all want the taller type of guys, I’m 5’4” so dating is basically impossible. Idk. I don’t wanna give up but I feel like I do at the same time. It’s rough out there for me.
What dates have you guys gone on where it started off really good, but then had an unexpected turn for the worse?	About 5-4 years ago I went on a date with a girl that knew my ex and we bonded a bit trashing her and then went bowling. Everything was great until we went to an eatnpark afterwards. We got into the topic of religion. Well. I believe when you die, you are dead. And she is a hardcore Christian girl. Needless to say I offended her a bit with my beliefs.	Went on a second date after a stellar first date. Go to an Italian restaurant great food. The whole time since the first date she's asking when she can meet my dogs because they are so cute. After a great meal I ask if she wants to come back to my place to meet the dogs. She says "yes"; oh boy here we go this date is only getting better. We get to my place; she instantly starts sneezing and coughing. Turns out she's allergic to dogs. Drive her home never hear from her again.
I’m moving out of my parents house finally after college and having a job, what advice or tips do you have for living on your own?	Garbage bags. You don't need to buy them. You get them every time you go to the store. My wife and I are in our thirties with two kids and some decent money in the bank. Our trash bags are still just free, plastic grocery sacks. We take the trash out every few days instead of once a week. Who gives a shit, ya know?	Have friends that aren't your roommate. Good fences make good neighbors, and if your roommate is your strongest point of social contact even the strongest of friends will begin to grate on each other.
Guys who pee on the seat of the office toilet and then don't clean it up, therefore creating a situation where someone else literally has to clean up your piss. What was the moment in your life that made you into the failure you've become?	Probably in Jr High. My question to the ladies is why do you get mad at the man for leaving the seat up, because you sit on the toilet at night? I would think it's your responsibility to make sure you don't sit in something gross. If I have to lift up the seat, I don't think it's asking too much not to be blamed because you didn't look where you're sitting.	I am a large person--about 6'4". If there is no urinal in the vicinity, and I am forced to use a toilet to pee--I sit the fuck down. My height, combined with (let's call it) "water pressure" results in massive splashback that I will not subject others to.
Why or why shouldn’t I take up a Western name, as an international student?	My friend came to my uni internationally and he has a really long first name/shorter last name so he just goes by his last name. If that’s the same case for you, where your last name is shorter and easier to pronounce, you could do that from a social standpoint.	I would try to make a short form that is pronounced easily by Westerners. For example my buddy Akshay goes by A.k.
What are your personal dating double standards?	I have had sex with about 25 women; she better not have a partner count in the double digits. > It's ok for you to not shave your legs, But you would prefer your partner to be shaved. I don't know if that really counts as a double standard. Men don't usually shave their legs, because... well, they're men. Women are not men. It's not a personal decision as much as a cultural phenomenon, a societal expectation. It's like how it's almost expected of women to shave their armpits, but not of men: it's not an individual double standard. A better comparison would be male vs. female pubic hair, I think. But I'm really nit-picking here.	I'm allowed to worry about my SO about anything cause I'm caring and shit, yet she's can't worry about me. That's like my big double standard, but it doesn't just go for my SO but for everyone. I'm never ok when someone worries about me, I don't know why.

What do you think about being in a long-term relationship with someone who has “less ambition” than you?	I’ve dated multiple people who didn’t have as much ambition as I did and all it really did was hold me back from opportunities and things I wanted to accomplish. After I got out of those relationships and I things for myself, it showed me I want to be with someone who’s ambitious and cares about where their life is going. Contentment is one thing, stagnancy is another.	Frankly, I suspect a relationship where both people are equally ambitious would be tough. What if one career offers a transfer to another city, and the couple has to choose whose career to prioritize, whose to hurt? As long as the less ambitious person realizes that long hours are a permanent part of the package and the more ambitious one realizes they'll be picking up the financial load, I don't see a problem with a "mixed" relationship in this way.
Whats something controversial in the western culture but is completely normal in yours?	White people don't get why I don't just go against my mother's wishes about tattoos on my body even though I'm 31.	Nigerian/Lebanese- US •Childhood nudity is not controversial. •Obviously spanking kids (i don't like it personally) •Calling your elders by their first names, shouting at them etc is abnormal in mine •Using your left hand to communicate with people is considered very rude in mine • Smoking, pre marital sex, tattoos, drinking, is VERY controversial in mine. • Living with your parents is not controversial in my culture.
What is the “pickiest” reason you had to stop dating someone?	He ate fish and chips with his hands. Culturally people eat food with their hands where he’s from and I’m from the same culture as well although less recently removed than he was, so while surprising it wasn’t entirely shocking. Either way that’s pretty much did him in.	He was so dumb. I’m so sorry he was so sweet, nice, kind, and my god he was hot, but I literally could not sit and have a conversation with him.
How important is physical affection to you in a relationship?	I prefer non-physical after a couple of traumatic events in my last relationship. My love languages are gifting and gestures, but not physical usually. Maybe after some time I would like to cuddle someone I feel safe with, but that's basically it. The thing is though, a lot of people want sex in a relationship and I can't offer that. If I find someone who can respect my needs but also aren't asexual, I will be chill with them having a sex buddy because I totally understand that it's super important for some people. I would like them to be only commited to our relationship only though, outside of the sex buddy.	Non sexual physical affection is important to me. Hand holding on a long drive, cuddling on the couch, a quick shoulder rub while cooking. Super reassuring and comforting to me.
Girlfriend hates some of my friends. How do I help this situation?	I'm going to withhold my advice due to bias, because "doesn't get along with my friends" falls under the deal breaker category for me.	Its perfectly reasonable for her not to want to hang out with some of your friends. Its often a red flag if she is trying to pressure you not to hang out with your friends. On your end, you should be conscious of how much quality time you are spending with them vs her. By "quality time", I mean something more than sitting down and watching Netflix after work. How much time do you spend climbing with your friends, vs going places and doing things with her?
Why are you single?	Broke, single, out of shape, depressed, not interested in anything, not good company, no friends, unemployed, no hobbies, ugly, fat, stupid, suicidal, worthless, fat, stupid, ugly, broke, jobless, stupid	Couple of reasons, one of the biggest ones is probably how clueless I am, I just how no idea how to handle even slightly romantic or sexual situations. also I'm rather shy, but don't look the part (I'm pretty confident in other areas) which also makes this more difficult. and finally I guess I'm just lazy, trying to work on that part but it's hard to change
Hi all, could you tell us a funny story from your life please?	Not so funny but I have to share: Yoko Ono walked right fucking past me 2 days ago but I didn't see her :(((	One time when I was little I woke up screaming, and my mom of course came running to see what happened. I told her I had a nightmare and she asked me what it was about, and I said "Sissy took my cereal!!!" So that was my true fear. Having my cereal taken from me.
DAE worry about longterm birth control use and its affect on your brain, body, cycle and relationships?	Yep! One of many reasons I refuse to be on HBC. Taking a pill that externally regulates an entire system of the body to me, healthwise and just in a philisophical sense, is not a good thing and likely far more harmful than we realize. I also really like knowing my natural cycle - it's empowering to me to know that what my body does is, like, it's own thing, and not caused by a pill	I do wish there was more long term research available about how BC effects the body in the long run but I don't think/worry about it much because I don't really have a choice but to use it.
What are your bad online dating stories?	Finally met her after talking for forever. Made out on the first date. Smashed on the second and third. Really got down on the fourth. Called things off by the fourth month because she seemed to only be interested in non-monogamy. Yea, that's about all i got. Really fucking fell for this woman. Have a real hard time getting over it.	One time a guy told me the next day that he has a wife and two kids but they're only together for the kids and both date separate people. Yeah okay. Also, he gave me a didgeridoo that he carved, on our first and only date.
How many of you have trouble gauging how attractive you are, or whether or not you're attractive at all?	I know I'm not considered attractive because I'm overweight, and everyone knows fat women are the worst thing in the world /s I actually have no idea about my face. I can look at my face in the mirror and think "I look great" and "I look fucking weird" in the same minute and not know the truth.	Sometimes, I'm like "DAMN. Go put on some make-up, or, better yet, hide all day inside." Then sometimes, I'm like "DAY-UM! You should be a model!" It varies by day/ cycle/ sleep/ hydration/ attitude/ productivity/ exercise. I don't know if other people can see the subtle changes, but I feel like my attractiveness changes. A lot. I have different outfits/ makeup routines/ methods for dealing with them, which helps
Men that have bought male sex toys, has it changed your perspective on the real thing?	The best way is to imagine that since most women cannot get orgasm from penetration, every time we have penetration sex with you we know that its not that pleasurable for you and you can get far more pleasure from masturbation and vibrators. Compared to that, I don't think male sex toy is such a big deal for your insecurities. From women lack of pleasure from penetration ( but many of them still into it), you as a woman should have known better that sex is not all about physical sensation, but emotional connection too. Unless you think men don't experience those things like women.	I've got one. Girlfriend bought it for me, 5th anniversary. It's great fun, and feels lovely but the amount of effort that is put into using it isn't always what you want from a quick session. Lubing, Cleaning, drying. Unless you have a good amount of sexual privacy in your own home, it's hard to feel motivated to use it sometimes. It's amazing for reconditioning your penis to feel stimulated from friction if the normal act of masturbation (deep tissue massage) gives you death grip. Edit: and no, it won't replace you. Feels similar to a vagina. Not preferable.
What do we do, that women don't know we do?	SOME women are shocked to find that "watching 1 hour of porn every day" is pretty normal for men. Even the women that watch porn themselves.	The common perception is that men talk about their sexual exploitations freely with their friends, while women are more modest about theirs. I've found the exact opposite to be true.
What work advice are you sick of hearing?	Managers giving the line "it'll all even out eventually!". While that may be true it doesn't justify something that's unfair for your employees at the moment!	"If it's making you unhappy, quit". Sometimes that is easier said than done. I would never quit a job unless I had something else lined up and that can take time with the availability of jobs, etc.
Men who have traded in a high paying job they hated, for a low paying job they love, what’s your story? Any regrets?	Haven’t personally done this, but I’d just keep in mind that you’re only at a job you hate for 8 hours a day, you’re poor 24 hours a day.	I decided to go from a $250k a year to a $80K. I just didn't like the stress and amount of time that the higher paying job came with. I can't say I love the job i'm doing now but it pays the bills and I have to do very little and hardly ever interact with other people. No real regrets and who knows one day I might decide to go back to the higher paying job.
What made you realize that your loyalty was being wasted on something/someone undeserving?	She insulted my dad, who is a Coronavirus doctor, to my face and kept going on about how covid was a hoax. Haven't talked to her in nearly a year after being inseparable. No ragrets.	Working in places where they expect you to repeatedly go above and beyond your duties without any hint of a pay rise or promotion.
When you watch porn, are you getting off on the idea of the situation happening to you or is the fact that it is happening before your eyes?	People just watch porn cause it's probably the closest to being with a girl you can get, so it's easy stimulation. Not really any deep meaning behind the fact it's easy and the closest thing to real you can get. Any guy who watches porn should know shit is just bad for you, women too probably. It's over the top stimulation that can just become dull over-time. For women it probably doesn't matter because they don't need to get an erection like guy do, but there's a reason young guys get ED and porn doesn't help that	The former. I always imagine myself in the porn that I watch. I think this is the main reason that I don't enjoy lesbian porn.
Whats the most ridiculous question you’ve seen asked on this subreddit?	Any question where, by the rules of the sub or otherwise, there will only be one acceptable answer, and no other reply will be seen or engaged. Topics include, off the top of my head, abortion/ minority rights/ healthcare in the US/ anything about "do women like x,y,z"	The guy that basically asked if women have thoughts and are self aware Then when he rightfully got ripped a new one, he edited it to tell us we all just didn’t understand what he was asking
Do people really think there is no difference between having a height preference and having a weight preference?	Yes. One is related to an attribute that can be changed (weight) and the other one to something which can't (height). So, don't let anyone shame you for having weight-requirement(s), just be smart enough to not broadcast the preference for everyone to hear. >/r/AskWomen I wouldn't take anything said on that wretched place too seriously.	Judging people for what they like or do not like is just silly. If someone does not like fatties, fine. If someone does not like skinnies, fine.
What do you love most about the city you live in?	I live in Deltona FL. I am only about a 25-30 minute drive to the beach and some of the best quesadillas I've ever eaten.	That I can drive in any direction and reach either the ocean, mountains, forest, or desert in under 3 hours.
If you get into a fight with your clone, how could you win?	Rocks, paper, scissors. The other concedes. In a world of violence and chaos RPS brings order. I'm not a pacifist, but only willing to engage in violence if victory is assured or desperately needed.	Presuming that the clone is perfect, the more important question here is whether it even matters which one of us wins.
What sexist tropes are you tired of seeing in TV/film?	Nerdy/dorky/ugly girl needs to be "fixed" to get a man/rule her country/save China. Smart women are only well educated because they are socially awkward and couldn't find a man yet. (Then they meet the hero and quit being a doctor/scientist/spy.)	Why the fuck does every female main character need a stupid romance plot? Guys do not, so why do women?
Ladies, what's the worst you were ever treated by a guy, at what point did you realize he didn't care about you the way you cared about him, and how did you move on and learn from that experience?

Do you ever not check your messages on Facebook messenger so other people won't see you've read their messages?	You can mark the messages as unread. I usually do that if I don't want them to see I read the message.	All the damn time. If I don't feel like responding at the moment, I won't read the message because I know I hate to read that someone has "seen" my message and just hasn't responded. This way I can at least trick them into thinking I haven't read their message yet and I can reply when it's convenient for me.
Do you have any physical insecurities/flaws that have changed the way you behave or live your life?	I mean, obvious answer but I only ever shave because I naturally have hair that I don't want to have.	i used to avoid eye contact with people because i was worried they'd look at me and think me unattractive, and used to walk with my head down, too, but i'm trying to break out of those habits.
What's something difficult to accept about life as a man, that all men should?	You'll always have to be cautious with how you approach women. If you take a wrong step, you could end up in a lawsuit that's fated to screw you. Won't happen to most of us, because most will be cautious just in case	I once saw a video about how Camus thought that the best way to avoid misery is to accept that life is absurd and to find meaning within the absurd is the path to satisfaction. Or maybe it was a perfume ad, I'm not entirely sure.
What fictional women do you find completely fake and unrealistic to the point of anger?	Donna from Dr. Who. I know a lot of fans just love her, but I can't stand her. She's the stereotypical loudmouthed annoying woman to the point that its like nails on a chalkboard just seeing her. It was way too over the top.	I can't remember her name, but the "love interest" in the second Indiana Jones movie. All that woman did was scream. The second movie was nearly unwatchable for a few other reasons but for me, the Shrieking Asswipe was a big reason.
Fitness men of reddit, what is your best trick for getting into incredible shape?	Work out faster. What I mean is stop resting for 5 minutes between sets. Do a set, rest 5 seconds and then go again. Its weight training + cardio in one shot.	Show up. Literally nothing else matters other than that. Whether that be by showing up at the gym, or not eating all the shitty junk food you've become accustomed to. Just show up.
Tired of smoking weed and it's become a soft addiction. Dudes who quit smoking pot, how's life after giving up the devils lettuce?	It sounds like you're looking for an easy way out but there is none. You will go through withdrawal and feel like shit and have intense urges for a couple of weeks. You might even feel like killing yourself. But if you get through it, you will be glad on the other side, because it sounds like that's what you want	I gave it up for the wife. I must admit that I really don't miss it. I think a bit clearer now, more motivated in some aspects, but I did like doing yard work while stoned.
Can you tell me about your best friend?	Day 1 of college, this nerdy fella came up and asked if I like to drink. 7 years later, we have nothing in common but our love of alcohol. He's the best man in my wedding.	He lived in the dorm room next door to me freshman year. We were very different people. I was a nerdy fat kid studying engineering and he was running track at our school and studying Political science. I went to prom alone, he was the prom king. However I stuck around (initially probably because all the ladies liked him) and he was never a dick to me. He didn't make me the butt of jokes and over time we became friends. That was 11 years ago, earlier this year he got married and I was his best man. Really good dude.
How do you feel about other guys saying stuff like "I wish that happen to me" on cases in which a (female) teacher slept with a minor (male)?	I'm going to go against the group here and say that I would agree with them. I was a horny little fuck, and even though I'd likely have been super nervous/anxious about having sex (much less having sex with a teacher), I definitely would have jumped at the chance had it been presented.	I mean, sure, 13 year old me thought the idea of fucking a hot teacher was awesome. But that kid was 13, and we should not take him seriously.
Men dating someone famous, how's it working out?	I am not dating a 'social media celebrity' and I don't think I would. I hate social media, and the idea of people becoming famous for how carefully they're able to curate themselves to get the right persona of hot and interesting makes me gag. Being famous for social media is not so different for why the Kardashians are famous. It takes a level of vanity, narcissism, and focused attention to something I can't stand to get there, so we're probably a bad match.	I knew a guy who hooked up with a chick from High School Musical. He is gay now... so he is dealing with that.
how to tell your GF you don't really care about a certain thing she constantly talks about?	Some women are just like this. They are always talking (usually about themselves) and don't like having silence or quiet moments together. Just tell her you think its great she is interested in those things but you are not and would prefer to talk about other things. If she continues after that and just keeps talking at you then your other option is to just tune her out. That or leave.	I made a sign saying “for the love of Christ, please change the subject”. It wasn’t helpful at all. Don’t do this.

What is that one thing your partner does that you find endearing?	He always says sorry because he knows I’m incapable of doing it first. I’m working on it, but bless him for ending our small arguments.	Before he leaves on a work trip (which is often) he’ll hide little notes around the house for me to find.

Have you ever been rejected because you're not from the right continent/race?	Not that I know of. I am White British so I guess not as likely to have the issue as others might.	Asian guy here. And yeah, I've been turned down by nonAsians because they don't find Asian men attractive. I had one memorable girl at a bar tell me that she didn't see Asian men as men.
Men, what first clued you in that a certain woman was batshit crazy?	1. Lots of tats 2. Colored Hair 3. Lots of makeup 4. Lots of guy friends 5. Instagram user 6. Any kind of filters on their pictures 7. Single mothers 8. Has no real hobbies 9. Uses cell phone too much 10. Lazy 11. Entitiled 12. Sends mixed signals 13. Talks crap about other people 14. Clingy/Dependant 15. Never pays 16. Unpredictable emotional swings 17. Gossips 18. Crappy relationship with family 19. Tries to drive a wedge between your current friends/family 20. They guilt trip I could go on but I can sum it up pretty easily. Most women. Before all the soyboys, SJWs and females come to attack me. I said most women not all. I will assume anyone who has a problem with my list is either a women who falls into one or more of these or a man who is looking to virtue signal.	She was legitimately upset at me that I had cheated on her in her dreams with a girl named Erica. Anytime I was going to be hanging out with the guys or just generally not with her, she would ask if I was seeing Erica. I didn’t then, and I still do not know anyone named Erica.
Have any women here given birth despite having Tokophobia or "fear of childbearing"?	I don't have any kids nor have any desire atm or ever. But I do have a fear of giving birth. I have a host of health problems. One of which is I can not handle physical pain at all, and I don't want epidural due to the fact that it goes in the spine. I also have a thing about spines which grosses me out and I don't want to put something on it. I guess I'd go with a c section if I were to give birth. I just don't want to push for the fact that I could not handle the pain at all. I'd also have a fear that I would be unable to push out the baby due to my lack of muscle strength overall.	I was terrified of being pregnant and especially the whole birth thing. Pregnancy sucked but it was mostly uncomplicated. Birth was the most traumatic thing I have ever endured. I ended up with a vacuum delivery, a 3c tear and all sorts of pelvic floor dramas. My daughter will be an only child. I am never going through that again. It was actually worse than I imagined it could be. The most upsetting thing is everyone telling me that I will change my mind and do it again. It seems that all the only children in the world can't possibly exist.
Would you like it if your SO sent you flowers at work?	Don't send me anything at work!! I have a professional image to keep up and I don't need to look like a blushing school girl in front of my co-workers. Flowers are PDA (IMO) and should be kept for my private life. Edit: Sorry, thought this was ask women :(	flowers for women at work= physical object meaning SO cares about you flowers for man at work= physical object meaning SO wants to embarrass you.
What are some red flags when talking to people online?	Signs or admission of depression or mental health issues. May be unfair, but ... long ugly story. I just run away when I suspect it.	Two things that would make me cut contact immediately are: - they get impatient or needy waiting for your replies - they don't respect your boundaries
Women of Reddit who were skeptical of having kids and then did... Were you wrong about not wanting them? Did you have them because your SO wanted them? Was it an accident? Or...?	Total accident but I don't regret it. I love her she's funny and cute and smart she's four months and it's really cool getting to know her. Four days before I found out I was pregnant I walked in on my SO coked out having sex with a coworker on our couch. We decided to stay together for her and things have been pretty chill this past year.	I was on the fence about it, but a firm no on bio. kids, so I fostered. All the joys of parenting, with kids that came pre-named and potty trained. Perfect solution for me, and I like angsty teenager age kids. 10/10, still a firm no on biologically having and raising kids
Do you agree that the best relationship is one in which you are with your best friend? If so, do you also agree that the relationship doesn't begin that way?	In my opinion, it's only positive if you're in a relationship with your (best) friend, but I don't agree with the other part. I was friends with my SO for over a year before I had feelings for him and we began dating. I wouldn't say he was my best friend at the time, but definitely a really good one. We haven't been together for very long (over 7 months so far), but I do think that aside from being lovers we are still great friends and that adds a lot to our relationship.	I don't really want to be "wooed" in the way you're describing. I don't want to falsely be made to feel special, and I don't want anyone building a fantasy around or for me. I've posted about it before, but one of my favorite things about my boyfriend is the degree to which he's been upfront and forward with me from day one. Bringing up things that bugged him early in our relationship was a huge plus to me, and it's very consistent with how he is now. He definitely is my best friend, but he might not have become so if he had been focused on playing a part for me.
What's your laughably horrible worst date story?	Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.	He picked some fluff out his bum crack, asked me if I knew what it was, then sniffed it. I just got up and walked away. I couldn't even make an excuse to leave.
What's with all the STEM worship on reddit?	Fragile masculinity parading as unquestionable emotionless unbiased logic. Edit: There's the angry man brigade, so emotional, it's just a joke y'all	Just my personal guess but...I'm thinking most redditors are "nerdy" and most nerdy types get science type degrees. Science fields feel that their degrees are more difficult to obtain and therefor worship them more than a liberal arts degree. There is a pecking order in college. I have a B.S. in civil engineering and among the other engineering schools such as electrical and mechanical, they thought our program was too easy and picked on us.
Do Feminist Friends judge your monogamy?	>Do Feminist Friends judge your monogamy? **NO.** If your friends express disdain over monogamy, then your friends aren't feminists, they're *tumblrinas*.	No, I've never experienced this. What your friends are doing is invasive, rude, and presumptuous as fuck. Ask them why they think they have any say in how you structure your romantic relationships, and why they feel the need to judge yours when you've been more than accepting of theirs.
How normal is it for you to fantasize about the women in your lives?	Women need a reason to have sex, men just need a place - Billy Crystal. &#x200B; I don't know if men or women picture others people in their lives, but I've heard it from both, mostly men. Sex is totally different for men than women. For men it's about as emotional as a morning pee. It's a mechanical function that one can include as part of the love and intimacy dance, but it is not necassary. &#x200B; As Nora Vincent said after her time posing as a man, "For women sex is here (pointing to her head), for men its here (pointing to her crotch). &#x200B; I'm happy with being male is all I can say.	Definitely. I find myself doing it less and less as I get older, but in high school and college age, it was pretty frequent.
I called my SO's penis by accident, and I am mortified. Do you think this would affect him in any way?	Bring up in conversation: 'My friend (a friend of OP in case) said she was dating this guy with a small dick, so I told her I was so lucky to have you' Something like that. Wrap it up casually, he'll probably feel good both about you thinking he is good and others knowing it too.	His change of subject *may* be an indication that he did hear you, pretty much knows you didn't mean it *that* way, but still kind of bothered him despite knowing that because culturally such a deal is made of it for men, but this, but but that... Just avoid doing it again and casually compliment him to the opposite effect some time soon. Try not to make it too obvious or overdo it.
Fellas who have removed all their pubic hair, how is it working out for ya?	I wax and in general it's nice (takes like 15-30 minutes once a month) though the pain (it's really not that painful) and cost might not be for everyone. In general, shaving is annoying because when the hair starts growing in, it is a blunt edge (which makes it seem thicker) and is a lot itchier than with waxing. Also for me, I get less ingrown hairs with waxing which is also a bonus. If you do shave, don't shave around your asshole, it becomes the worst thing ever as hair grows in.	It was really nice and breezy to be honest, and not nearly as much ball-stuck-to-leg action as I expected! Would recommend
What are some things you've tried really hard to enjoy, or always felt you were meant to enjoy, but eventually decided you just couldn't get into?	Sports. Why the fuck do I want to sit there for an hour and watch people exercise and while I get fucking fat.	Beer. It tastes awful. I can't understand why people enjoy it so much. Maybe I didn't start drinking young enough?
What are some common sentiments you see on Reddit about dating and relationships that you disagree with?	That infidelity of any kind indicates a lack of respect for the partner who was cheated on and that the relationship should be ended immediately.	That it is someone's fault. Sometimes shit just doesn't work, sometimes people don't mesh, sometimes people grow apart and change, sometimes life isn't fair, and sometimes the only thing you can do is concede with grace, walk away, and move on. Placing blame on someone for every situation seems small minded. The universe is complex and sometimes it isn't anyones fault. It's okay to feel about it, but it isn't fair or helpful to be placing blame all the time. You force someone else to be the victim of your inability to process effectively. It's a feedback loops of ugly things and ineffective coping skills.
I find it so hot when men are good with babies/ little kids. Do you feel the same with women?	Pretty sure that is an age thing not a gender thing. Most women of childbearing age flip out over anything "baby". Guys tend to not care right up until they're holding / seeing their own. Like a weird switch in the brain.	It's nice, but it doesn't make any dick rock hard or anything. More sentimental than that, I'd say. &#x200B; Or in other words, more like a heart-on than a hard-on.
What term do you use to describe your relationship to your pet (e.g. "I am my dog's ________")?	I'm my cat's owner. I am not her mother, her mama, her mom or her parent in any way. That is gross to me, and I always correct the vet techs who refer to me that way. I love my cat to death and she is the closest thing to a baby I'll ever have. I love her so much and she gives me a reason to get out of bed on my worst days and I dote on her. But I am *not* her mother in any way.	I am my cats' housekeeper, doorman and chef. Just kidding, I am their person, and they are my prisoners with Stockholm Syndrome.
What are your tips for good Sex?	Why does the word 'slut' keep getting thrown around in this thread? Not trying to start a feminist argument here but why doesn't that rule apply to men in this context? Enjoying sex makes a woman a slut? Since when?	Build some tension. I'm a big fan of the slow play. Especially on the weekends tease her throughout the day. Side note: only works if you guys like each other. Doesn't work with casual arrangements.
Fellow ladies with a "high number" of sexual partners. How have SO's reacted when you told them. Or do you have a no tell policy? Also do you have any regrets?	Men who have a problem with my (high ish)number usually have other serious character flaws that would preclude any kind of relationship so yes, i have told people i dated, none who were a good person otherwise had a problem with it. I am highly incompatible with the type of guy for whom numbers would be a problem, anyway. I don't play numbers games on reddit because of ad hominem dudebros but like you, op, i started really young but other than that feel my number is highish normal- i just had a head start on some people. I too feel that it has shaped who i am and how i see sex and relationships, so i really would not change it. I have more regrets about my marriage than i do about the first time i had sex or the amount of people i have had sex with.	I haven't been asked any of that in so long. My husband doesn't care about my number and doesn't want to know. Sure i regret some of it but mostly i just don't think about it anymore because i don't care. My mother used to call me a slut for having sex with men outside of a committed relationship but she's cheated twice, that I'm aware of. So i guess it's ok to have a lot of sex with different people if you're IN a relationship, according to her. I've never cheated. So i have my morals in tact at least.
What romantic gestures would you like to see your SO do for you?	I don't really like romantic gestures. My idea of romance is very different than "roses and candles and calligraphy" romance.	I would really love to get flowers, even once. I try to stop and look at them in the grocery store every now and then as a subtle hint, but it's weird because I don't have a sense of smell and I think that translates as "what's the point of flowers, then?"
Why is it that people ask if you drink coffee or soda if you mention you don't drink or do drugs?	Caffeine is absolutely a drug, if you drink caffeine you do drugs. I've tried every drug. Caffeine is by far my favorite one.	I think they're just trying to figure out where your line is, amigo. No need to let it make you cross.
What's your most embarrassing moment while in front of your SO?	He tried to go down on me for the first time, but I had issues with vulva pain and it really hurt. I asked him to stop and he immediately did, but then I felt so guilty because my boyfriend really likes to please people and I know he wanted to please me (because I've given him blowjobs), so I started crying really hard. He hugged me and told me he wasn't upset at all for himself, he just felt bad that it was hurting me and that I couldn't enjoy it because of the pain. That made me feel a lot better, but it was still embarrassing for me to cry like that.	The first time I visited his family, I asked where the bathroom was and they pointed me in the general direction. I see a bathroom, I poop some gross looking diarrhea, I flush the toilet, nothing happens. I quietly tell my fiance, turns out that toilet was broken and I was supposed to use the *other* bathroom. So he goes in and tries to plunge it and fiddle with things to get it to flush, it doesn't work, so he asks his dad. Then his parents both come in and stand around, trying to get my diarrhea to go down their toilet.
Those who've dated "non-affectionate" girls, what was your experience like?	My ex started off as not very affectionate and it fucked with me for a while. She eventually got better at it but it did make me doubt things a lot for the first few months. Some people just aren't affectionate.	My SO is really not affectionate. She never touches me or hug me or shows physical signs of affection unless I do it. She usually responds to my affection in a positive way, but she remains a bit distant. The sex is absolutely not boring and lame though. Once it gets going, she is very passionate and into it. Showing affection and being into sex is two different things. I have to be dominant though. If I do nothing, nothing is going to happen. But, that doesn't mean she is a starfish. It's quite the opposite. She just goes with the flow.

Guys, what is your SO flaw that someone outside your relationship would see as a red flag?	Well my girlfriend is Mexican, so there are a bunch of backwards Americans right now that would call that a red flag. Luckily we live in Canada.	I've lost friendships over this one. Before I do anything, I check in with him. Not in a permission kind of way, but in a "hey I want to do this with X, can we afford to/is that cool?" Because sometimes he had something planned for us that night, or he had a hard day and needs me around to help him decompress or whatever reason. And in the beginning of our relationship we were dirt poor and sometimes we couldn't afford to do stuff. Apparently this makes him abusive and controlling. But he checks in with me before he does anything too. I think it's just relationship common courtesy but whatevs.
Last night I dreamed I had a beautiful owl cat (cat with the huge majestic wings of an owl). What's the coolest thing you've ever dreamed about?	Keeping with the cat theme, I had a dream that my cat could text me. We need cat owls and we need texting cats - stat!	I had a dream that I was squatting at a gym and Terry Crews came up to me and told me I had perfect squat form. He then worked out with me till I woke up. Best dream ever 😍 my bf was jealous haha not that I was working out with Terry Crews but because he wasn't lol *but seriously if any one can just hook me up with a gym session with Terry Crews that would be great*
Ladies, what is something you do that influences you to be more positive?	Surrounding myself with positive people. It’s so much easier to have a positive outlook on life and situations when others surrounding you do the same	Surrounding myself with positive people. It’s so much easier to have a positive outlook on life and situations when others surrounding you do the same
What is something about yourself that people often don't believe or ignore when you tell them? How do you deal with this?	that i almost died from my eating disorder a few years ago, or generally that i have one at all~ because i am fat. or you know, the usual things. i am fat and therefore i must sit around stuffing my face full of sugar and junk food all day. hah.	A lot of people do not believe I'm 6 feet tall. At least until I stand up and they're right next to me then I get, "Oh yeah, I guess you're right." I do know my own height, but thanks. This one guy who was shorter than me (5'8"? 5'9"?) kept saying he was taller than me, AS I was making eye contact with his forehead.
How did you manage to screw up a date you were on?	I paid with a gift certificate. This was before the more acceptable gift cards that look like credit cards. I didn’t tell her but I got the gift certificate by complaining about my service on a previous visit. Maybe this girl just didn’t like me but I attributed it to the gift certificate. She was cute too and had big boobs.	Asked a girl on date and we went to the boat show that was in town. We're looking at this huge yacht and she went down the ladder first. I went down the ladder after her and slipped on a rung. I kicked her right in the jaw and knocked her out. Medics came and got her. Never talked to her again.
My boyfriend has been hi ting about wanting to get in shape, for those of you who normally hate exercise, what is you favorite way to stay active?	Yoga. Specifically Bikram yoga. It's hot as hell (105 degrees), sweaty, and actually a pretty decent workout for losing weight and conditioning. Plus, depending on your local studio, it usually comes with a friendly community of positive and healthy people. And the mental discipline it cultivates is helpful as well. If that's too "new agey", CrossFit is a more testosterone-oriented option. Again - the social aspect of it can serve as a good motivator for folks like me who have trouble getting ourselves to the gym on our own.	Rock climbing. He should love it, strengthens the tendons in the forearms which can actually help with percussion. It's also one of those things that makes you tired, but you don't realize it until you're done.
Women who work 9-5 or equivalent, what’s your morning routine? Do you rush in the mornings to make it to work on time?	i work 10-6. goal wake up time is 7 to 7:30, 8 at the latest. i smoke a cigarette first thing and take care of the dog next. then i set aside what i’m going to wear for the day because i always end up inevitably rushing at the end because i’ll end up goofing off. after that i do something with my hair, brush my teeth, and start my hour long makeup routine. then i leave at 9:30 so i can get iced coffee and get to work a little earlier so i have time to chill before my clients start coming in. (i work in a barber shop. )	Everyone here is making me realize I need to get my life together. I work 7am-7pm. I usually snooze my alarm until 6:20. Brush my teeth, wash my face, put my hair in a pony tail and put on some mascara. I leave at 6:45, so I usually get to lay back down for another 10 minutes and then think about how much I’d rather die than to work.
Married women, if your partner was discrete and completely safe, would you allow them to sleep with other people? How do you feel about open marriages?	Absolutely 150% no. I'm monagamous through and through, so if my SO either cheated or asked if he could, it would be over. I said this before in another post maybe like a week ago: what is the point in having a relationship of any kind with someone if you're not going to want to only be with them? Just stay single if that's where your head's at.	Here are the percents for what women have said so far: No= 68% Yes/have done it= 21% Maybe= 4% Unclear answer= 7% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit: 3 hours later: No= 63% Yes= 26% Maybe= 5% Unclear answer= 6%
Women who date women. How are your relationships different than hetero relationships?	Eh, drama is drama. My first experience with lesbian relationships was through roller derby. Plenty of drama. The majority was derby-based. The rest was just standard relationship drama. Relationships are relationships.	Women are used to being the ones to be approached. So, I always am the one to make the first move, since otherwise we'd both be shy at each-other forever and it'd never go anywhere.
What's your take-to-the-grave secret that's actually really bad?	I made fake dating profiles of the girl my ex cheated on me with and left me for so that she would get harassed. I put all of her contact information in the profile so people would bother her.	One of my best friends' husband got drunk and hit on me. They've been together for 12 years, I didn't have the guts to tell anyone.
Female protagonists in video games: Are there any games out there that you think do an fantastic job portraying a girl/woman in the drivers seat of a story?	Sorry, the way you phrased this question made me feel like I should be answering "Oh hi. This is Lara Croft. And personally, I think that the only problem with video games is how many ancient works of architectural beauty are left unexploded and unplundered."	Maybe this is a cheat since it's an RPG, but I think the Dragon Age games are AWESOME to play as a female character. The romance options/storylines (gay and straight) are MUCH better when you play as a woman. Same goes for the Mass Effect series. Plus the FemShep voice acting is way better than the male voice acting IMO. Life is Strange and Horizon Zero Dawn are also great.
Divorced Women of Reddit, What Are Some Things You Wish You Knew Before You Got Married?	When you're dating, start a red-flags list on each guy. Do a lot of detached analysis before allowing yourself to get emotionally involved or making a commitment. Don't be desperate.	I wish we'd been through a big fight. We didn't know how to disagree and go on. I just congratulated myself on how we never fought.
Women of color, what is one thing you wish the general population understood but seemingly doesn't?	That interracial racism is real. Some races can have many privileges over others. So as everyone seems to belittle this to having a "pissing contest on who has the shittiest treatment", that is actually true. Some races have better shit handed to them so let us not forget that, nor act as if we have the same struggles.	People make it difficult for me to discuss sexism in my culture because anything I say is used by racists to "prove" that my people are savage and backwards.
Does anyone else think of getting dressed up as "putting on your hot girl disguise"?	Personally I dress up enough to look cute. I find that girls that actively try to look 'hot' tend to end up looking like they are trying to hard. I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl. If everything fits well and looks classy, the cute girl outshines the girl in high heels and a mini every time (in my opinion).	Hahaha! This question made me laugh a lot. I really like dressing up and so I think of every situation like a costume (rather than a disguise). I would get as excited to go to an ugly sweater party as a cocktail party because I would still have to plan an appropriate "costume". I want to wear a white dress for my wedding not cause I am traditional but because that's what the bride costume is. I hate wearing white in all other situations.
How have you grown as a person recently?	My transition has taken huge steps and given me more motivation to treat myself better every day instead of being so down.	I'm getting better at letting things go until there's a better or more appropriate time to have a discussion. Basically tabling things instead of hastily rushing into things to soothe my anxiety.
Guys who worked very hard and made a lot of money, do you regret it? Guys who did something they enjoyed, but ultimately made no money, do you regret it?	If you have the ambition to sit at the top of the world, you'll know if you can happy making that minimum wage. Money won't make you happy, but you can't be happy without it.	I just left a job making ok money but with good quality of life for a job making great money and no quality of life. I would go back in a second, what's the point of having money if you're working all the time, can't take vacation, have no friends or relationships, and are stressed out all the time. That's not a life in my opinion. It seems like the people who enjoy that type of work environment are hiding from something. I'm probably quiting in the next couple of weeks. Sidenote: If you start missing a lot of events outside of work and seem miserable all the time, your phone will pretty quickly stop ringing. I'd rather be happy and live within my means.
I feel like some poeple have unrealistic porn-like expectations. What are your stories on this topic?	Reading this has done nothing but remind me how horrible most sex education is here in the US. At best it teaches you how to avoid getting stds but doesn't really go into the dos and donts of what is actually enjoyable. At worst (usually in private religious schools) they straight up lie to you and say the only way to practice safe sex is abstinence.	I've both had guys that got obsessed with/fixated on making me cum as many times as possible with zero regard for whether or not I was even still enjoying it, as well as had guys call me a liar or accuse me of faking when I *do* have multiple orgasms because "only women in porn cum like that and they're probably faking, too".
What are some things that men do, or willing to do, that immediately screams, 'he loves her so much'?	Please feel free to answer with things that women do that immediately scream "she loves her SO so much" as well.	Please feel free to answer with things that women do that immediately scream "she loves her SO so much" as well.
What are the chances of peeing in my girlfriends mouth when I’m asleep?	I would say, if you aren't already erect then go for it. If you are erect then you probably have to pee.	Well, first of all, unless it's a usual thing for you to wet the bed, I don't see why you should randomly pee in that specific case. Other than that, it's *highly* unlikely that you won't immediately wake up from it. EDIT: My most highly rated comment is now about peeing in your girlfriend's mouth. Perfect!
Askmen, what popular movie in your opinion espouses the wrong idea of masculinity?	Star Wars 7 has really struck me at this. I left the movie thinking that almost non of the male characters displayed a real human but always just aspects, really flat parts of what masculinity can be. On the other hand Rey is presented more like a male than a female as if it was impossible to be a strong and powerful character with the capability to change the universe for the better as a real female character. Had the impression that (in the eyes of whoever ruined the franchise) masculinity equals either power or unproductive uselessness, while women could only be either manly to be powerful or useless grieving women like Lea I really did not enjoy that movie it left me very uncomfortable with the taste of some artifical nonsense pressed into something i held dear as a child.	The Wolf of Wall Street. That movie is like some kind of a test. There were guys I know who came out of the theatre wanting to be Belfort, and there were others who went home and suddenly didn't feel so bad about their unexciting jobs and their plain wives. To this this day I'm still torn on it. EDIT: Spelled his name wrong.
What is something rude people do without being aware of it being rude?	Apparently, when somebody who is more senior than you at work screams at you from across the kitchen, you're supposed to say "Yes ma'am?" instead of asking "What do you need, (Name)?". Worked with an older black lady last year who read me the riot act for not giving her "respect" because I would yell back (as politely as I could, considering she was on one end of the kitchen and I was on the other) "What do you need?". Apparently, it's also rude (or rather, it was according to her) to like "black" things like certain music, certain TV shows, etc if you're not black. o.O That I didn't know.	Folks who aren't aware of the physical space they take up. I've always been really tall and somewhat insecure about it so I think I have a hyperawareness of this, but when folks back up into people or are waving to friends and smack other people/almost do in the face or are fistpumping at concerts or take up the entire sidewalk with their friends *with no regard for everyone around them* it makes me SO mad. Just...be aware of where you are and where other people are around you. PLEASE.
As a man reading through some answers on this sub, it seems increasingly more and more like more men than I ever thought were screwed up or predatory and it's better to be safe. Is this a general assumption women make? What can a guy do to combat this image?	* **Status: Locked permanently after moderation clean-up.

I have never dated a guy who expected me to pay for anything. Am I just lucky or is this the norm?	You haven't met me. Any indication that you expect me to pay for you and you're out the door. It's curious that I've been actually called a sexist in real life when admitting that I'd never pay for a woman on a date.	My coworker is paying all of the rent for him and his girlfriend, at $1400 a month. Poor bastard. I think it's more common for the guy to pay for everything in cases where he makes good money and she doesn't. Outside of that case, it's a lot more even I think. It's typically a realistic assessment of what makes sense financially for both people.
My husband said to me last night, "if you're having trouble sleeping, put some vodka in your butthole". What has your SO said lately that resulted in you blankly staring at them?	That he was planning on moving in with his mother after his dad dies to take care of her. For potentially decades. I had to explain to him that caring for an old person who has memory issues already at the age of 60 and who has Alzheimers in the family is not a thing you can do and also have a career. And also that I would really not be okay with that living situation.	In response to asking how his evening went: "Not bad. They crashed a ship into an ocean to try and wash it. Pretty much the high point." Took me a few moments of utter confusion (we don't have a ship or live near the ocean) to remember that he'd run his ongoing Star Wars tabletop game with his friends that evening.
If a man wants his to-be-wife to take his surname otherwise he won't get married, do you think that makes him sexist?	Not at all. My husband was pretty adamant about it and after hearing his reasoning, I don't think it's sexist at all, I think its a nice tradition and a man, or anyone else, is okay to want that for his family	Since praise is hard to come by in this sub, I wanted to point out that I think OP is doing a wonderful job of expressing disagreement without being dismissive or antagonistic. This is an interesting thread. Well done.
Men who now make a lot more money than they used to, did you notice any change in your relationships with women?	No change. We're both feminists, so I respect that she wants to be independent and contribute equally to expenditures. Small exceptions are made now and then, and I've convinced her to let me treat her to restaurants every now and then, because *I want to*. She and I have a healthy amount of respect for each other - she often compliments me on my entrepreneurial spirit/savvy, and I marvel at her logical brain all the time. She's often two or three levels deeper than I am on a lot of topics, and it always humbles me to see how much narrative there is in everyday life.	I went from making $8.55 an hour to $11.35 an hour so I can afford more gas and food and stuff.
What are some red flags you missed in the early stages of a relationship due to chemistry?	He really liked his alone time. Before we lived together, we'd spend 1-2 nights a week together. Never more. After we moved in together, he still spent a lot of time without connecting. TV, video games. But only rare moments of quality time still 1-2 times per week. Being with him was lonely.	His jealousy. I thought he really liked me and wanted to spend a lot of time with me. He was just trying to make sure no one else would steal me. He was very possessive. Even after we broke up.
When was the lowest point in your life? How old were you and how did you dig yourself out of it? How are you now?	Emigrated just to find myself without a job a doing a lot of shitty, less than minimum wage jobs. I managed to get a small grant to enroll for a Masters and live for a year. After the Masters I managed to land a job and the rest is history.	When the girl I loved left me. It made me realize how much I relied on her to make me feel good about myself. Without her validation I was a mess, but it made me realize that stepping my life up in all aspects was absolutely necessary. If you are in love with someone you should absolutely be prepared to be alone in an instant, would you be happy with yourself if no one was there to validate you. That's the question. EDIT: this is one of life's many catch 22 scenarios. I was holding onto this woman for validation because of her status and beauty, when in reality thats what caused her to leave. If i was my own man at that time things would have been a lot different.
If you accidentally didn't sleep because you were too caught up playing Stardew Valley, how would you get through a day of work staring at spreadsheets all day?	> Cause I am fucked up right now. If you're staying up all night playing a simulated farm game on a work night, you have more issues than a lack of sleep lmao	Are you me? I read this advise on Reddit a long time ago: find a conference room and a box of paperclips. Throw the paperclips on the floor, close the door, and sleep with your feet up against the door. If someone opens the door, it will bump your feet and wake you up and you can pretend to be picking up the paperclips.

Single men: do you find dating/being single fun or frustrating and depressing? How can I change my outlook?	Stop caring so much and you might have some fun. That's the key for me. The less I give a fuck about what some chick at a bar thinks of me, the more fun I have.	I hate being single. It's depressing. I find I will stay with people that are way wrong for me because I'd rather have someone than no-one. Currently alone and miserable....
When dating/getting to know people, how soon do you to like to bring up big/dealbreaker topics?	I'm a guy but I talk about this stuff immediately with women. I literally have multi-hour long phone conversations before we even meet up the first time. I like talking a lot about stuff like this though.	I tend to think the only people that would be scared off are the people I wouldn’t want to date anyway, but I haven’t scared anyone away so far. Normally I’ll start asking before or around the first date. I’m just not interested in wasting weeks of time to find out if someone is a giant racist or transphobic person.
Friend(M20) told me(M19) he cheated, what do I do?	OP don't listen to these girls, they are coming from the girls perspective. If it were the other way around and a girl told her girl friend she cheated on her boyfriend, the friend wouldn't tell the guy either. Sure you might think less of your friend but that's your business. Overstepping your boundaries and handling your friends dirty work for him is none of your business. The only time you would tell the girl is if you are also friends with her in which case it is your business to tell your friend who is also the girl.	What can you do? Nothing. He is an adult and he has to deal with his choices. Don't get too involved in it with your emotions.
Men of Reddit who had very little or no experience with everything that comes with relationships, what were the toughest parts to learn once you had serious relationship ?	Don't get into one,it's not worth it. Remember this saying,"tell a girl something negative,she'll remember forever. Tell her something positive and she'll forever ignore it."	Be honest with how you _REALLY_ feel. Don't accept everything because you are "different" or "nice". Stand your ground, especially when you know what the truth is.
How often do you come into contact with someone who makes your skin crawl?	Every now and then I have to hang out with my boyfriend's ex-girlfriend. They are a part of the same circle of friends. She hates my guts so it's pretty awkward.	Every week or so, a customer who comes into the shop where I volunteer. In lieu of a nice personality he has a small and extremely bug-eyed dog, which he uses as an excuse to force interactions. I now find reasons not to serve him as he makes me every uneasy, and I've had to stop him urging children to pet the obviously stressed and unhappy dog. We can't ban him, as he's done nothing wrong, but all the staff keep a very close eye on him now.
Have you ever approached an attractive stranger in public? What did you say and how did it go?	I remember I had one to many beers with my friend at a bar and there was a group of girls are ranging from attractive to meh. But with liquid courage inside of me, something told me I need to make their day, even if I didn't make their day I went up to them anyways. "Hey, all you ladies, you are all beautiful individuals, and no matter what anyone says, I think you're gorgeous" And walked away, they probably thought I was really weird or knew I was drunk, but I did and only to tell them they were pretty and walk away.	Yep! Cute Girl on the 6th floor of the library, saw her like everyday for like TWO MONTHS straight and occasionally we'd make awkward eye-contact. One day I had been listening to more Young Thug than usual and was like fuck it and cornered her in the elevator and awkwardly asked her for her number. BAM like 4 weeks later I'm typing this from one of the couches up on the 6th Floor and Cute Library Girl is sitting right next to me *wearing my jacket* haha nice
How did you get over betrayal for the first time?	I was never naive enough to think I was never going to get cheated on. I never believed any of my early gfs were going to be "the one". So it never held me back. Yeah, it sucked for a couple of days, but I've always had an easy time getting over breakups.	When I'm heart broken, I remind myself it's because I was able to let love in, and as much as the heart break sucks I can't close off my heart because I want to be a person who loves fully.
Redditors of AW who went to high school with someone famous, who was it and what were they like before their fame?	Don't want to give specifics on who but I went to high school in the US with a guy who became semi-famous as a pop star in Europe. In high school he was douchy and always concerned with his image. As part of his quest for fame, he got a nose job and lied about his year of birth on Wikipedia as if he were 4 years younger.	Twitch from "So You Think You Can Dance" and a bunch of other dance shows, movies, and Ellen. He was the only guy on the dance team at my HS and got so much shit for it, but he was always really sweet. He was a dance genius back then too and overshadowed all the girls. It's been exciting to see him being noticed for his talent and to see his hard work pay off.
Calling all successful relationships with separate beds or rooms how do you make it work? How has the separate sleeping spaces impacted your relationship?	Used to sleep together even though my husband snores quite loud before we had a baby. The rhythm of his snoring used to put me to sleep. Since the baby we have separate rooms. He misses sleeping together. I do too but baby Needs me more. Planning on another kid so going to be separate bedrooms for quite some time. I try and wake up early some days to Cuddle in the mornings but thats rare.	It’s really common here in Japan. A good number of couples actually have separate bedrooms, but are happily married. It’s a personal choice, IMO. If you can get better sleep in separate beds or rooms, then I don’t see any harm in trying it out. Maybe increase cuddle time/physical touch outside of bedtime to counter balance the lack of intimacy from not sharing a bed?
Women who need lots of alone time - How do you ask for space without hurting peoples feelings?	I don’t. It hurts my husbands feelings. Instead I take long lunches and spend 30-40 minutes in my car after work just playing Tetris or reading my book. It’s easier than hurting him.	I’ve found that for me, telling someone I need alone time but giving them an “end” time is helpful. Like saying “hey tonight I need some alone time but let’s talk Saturday morning. Can I call you then?” Or “I feel like I want to stay in and read tonight, but id love to hang out with you later in the week. When are you free?” If I just say I need to be alone with no resolution then that has a tendency to make people feel like they did something wrong. But if I reaffirm that I still want to talk or hang out with that person by giving them a time and letting them know that I’ll reach out or asking to make a plan makes it more clear that it’s a me thing.
How can i hold off on sex without getting called a tease?	You said it... they are boys. If you're being up front with them and saying sex isn't going to happen, you're not teasing. Even if you don't say this, and you stop before sex happens, you're not teasing. There is no obligation to have sex, even if you're making out like horny teenagers. These guys are being dicks. I'd suggest to just keep being as honest and transparent as you can, and let them deal with their own egos.	First step is probably stop going into dudes' beds and then wondering where the confusion is. Keep that boundary clear. Come in my room you cleaning it for cash or you fucking in it for free. Mention you take things slow and what not right around the time you first kiss the guy. Don't get into heavy makeout sessions, don't let their hands wander too much, and don't take off clothing until you've made the "this isn't leading to sex straight away" part clear. Lastly, quit caring about whether these guys think you're a tease or not. If they don't roll at your speed, they don't. Let them go.
Do you keep getting dumped after few dates? ever figured the reasons?	See, I have the opposite problem. I just want to go on a few dates, and its like as soon as we have sex these girls want to move in. To answer your question though, my advice is don't act like shes doing you a favor to be out with you. You have to play the game a little and appear slightly un attainable for a little bit, otherwise she filters you out because she subconsciously convinces herself shes out of your league.	Nothing goes wrong. You are competing with a lot of guys. What are the chances that you are the best fit over all of them? Pretty low. And you arent getting dumped if you were never in a relationship, so stop looking at it that way.
Single ladies of Reddit, what is the loneliest thing you've ever done?	Woken up on my own. My boyfriend didn't come home last night. He went out for a few drinks and he probably thought he was being helpful (I have work this morning) by crashing at a friends house rather than wake me up. But waking up on my own, with no text to let me know he's safe, has made me feel insignificant and worried.	I slept on my sofa during a breakup because when you have your back to the sofa back, it feels like someone else is there
How much time or how many meetings do you need, before you feel comfortable to sleep with a new partner?	I need to sleep with a partner before I can truly have an emotional connection with a partner. I've only had one instance where I didn't and we were together for nearly 4 months before we had sex.	Impossible to say on a generalized scale. I absolutely do require a strong emotional connection before wanting to have sex with someone, but how many "meetings" it takes for that emotional connection to form, really, really depends on the individual case. Certainly would never happen on the first, second, or third date though.
Would you call a girl if she left her phone on the bill?	"Hey, we click. Would you like to go out sometime?" Guys need to be hit over the head with a frying pan.	I think the easiest way would be to ask him, "I don't want you to feel awkward but would you like to get a drink sometime when you aren't working" Direct communication tends to work well with guys. #notallmen
Would you be offended if your wife admitted that she "settled" for you?	I would NEVER be with someone if I am settling and I would be heartbroken if I leaned my S/O was settling by being with me. I would rather be single than second choice and I would rather be single than settle for my second choice.	>What do you think of the idea that Gottlieb is promoting here? I think what Gottlieb is *really* saying to women is to forget the Prince Charming stuff, there is no knight in shining armor, so stop with the entitlement stuff and find a real man that exists on planet earth. If that is "settling," it is settling for reality.
I recently started spending more money on better, more spicy mustard. What mundane luxury do you give yourself?	High octane petrol. None of that regular crap for me, no thank you. I actually feel bad when I've had to use the regular stuff, like I'm being cruel to my motorcycle or something. I actually do get better city commuting mileage out of the high octane stuff though.	the moment i felt like i made it in life was when i could buy whatever orange juice i wanted, not just whatever was on sale.
Women who went to college and "screwed up" academically, what happened after you graduated/dropped out and where are you now?	I had a 1.7 GPA at one point due to repeated sexual assault one semester. I wasn't going to class to avoid the guy in the dorm doing the assaulting and my RA was his friend so nothing was being done. I did end up getting those classes removed from my transcript due to the circumstances, but I still didn't have work experience or network connections when I graduated. After 5 months of job searching I was able to find an awesome job in R&D sales thanks to an employment agency. I was hired permanently after 5 months and I've gotten a promotion as well since then. I make the same amount as my age group in the same region (who also have a degree) .	I'm in a highly competitive graduate program in a highly competitive field. It turns out you can bounce back from some pretty severe fuckups if you're willing to keep working.
Men of Reddit, what new dating dealbreakers have you developed as the result of failed relationships?	If she says she's a feminist. If her idea of a discussion (argument) is repeating herself over and over again and never actually responding to anything I say. Phone comes out.	Financial stability, or at least financial maturity. My last girlfriend was terrible with money and seemed to think that being in a relationship meant all money automatically belonged to us both. Too many times caught using my credit card without my knowledge or forging my name on checks were enough to make me break it off and say never again.
Any women feel like you're almost exclusively attracted to people more conventionally attractive than yourself? If so, how do you cope?	Sounds like you need to lower your standards. I mean, maybe this doesn't affect your dating life, or you don't care if you're single, but people usually date people that are a similar "rating" of attraction to them. Yes, exceptions happen, but it's rare. Anyone who feels like this usually either needs to lower their standards or make themselves more attractive (lose weight, take are of their appearance, wear make-up, etc). For me, people who are even just moderately attractive become more attractive as I spend time around them. And I'm not saying start dating an ugly dude in hopes he gets prettier with time. I'm saying that as I spend time with average looking people, I gradually find them more attractive over time. That's how attraction works with me. Then there are people who are instantly attractive also, but sometimes it's more because I've recognized my type.	Yep. I've always been more attracted to average, fit, or slim guys. And I've always been overweight. Hell, that's one of the reasons I've been working on losing weight. I can't expect a fit guy to want an unfit chick. So I've worked on improving myself to be a better person and attract the kind of guys I'm attracted to.
How was it living in a “redneck” area as a visible minority?	Might not be the exact answer you are looking for but I am white and my boyfriend is black. We live in a "redneck" area and have had many a times where we felt we had been discriminated against. That said, since we moved all of our neighbors have been really nice to us and not racist (at least in front of us)	Just the stereotypical “where are you from” “Ching Chong Ching” or “are you Chinese or Japanese?” and not knowing the huge obsession over sports.
Women with aspergers/autism traits, how did you know you were different and how long did it take you to be diagnosed?	Its interesting to because generally as adults, men are the ones who often get associated with autism.....womem are often underreported or they just socialize in a way where being autistic isnt pronounced aand easily identifiable. Ive always womdered but never bothered to check why men seem to be the face of it more so than women When u think about it, if a guy is socially awkward, its often seen as bizarre and weird..whereas women are seen more along the line of "cute" for similar behavior.	I watched Rainman when it first came out (late 80's) and asked my mother if maybe there was a milder version of that that I had. Autism was brand new to most of the world at that stage so she told me not to be silly. A few years later when I was in my 20's, Aspergers became a thing and the penny dropped. I've never been officially diagnosed because I was long out of the school system by then and there was no need. My son has been though, and he's just like me at that age.
What is your "just being friendly" behavior? Something you do with people that you are just being friendly with but NEVER with someone that you are romantically/sexually interested in?	For me, making friendly conversation is totally something I'd do with a stranger /someone I'm not interested in. I've been in food service for 10 years and "small talk" is just something that comes very easily. A regular I used to have said once I was the Queen of the Soundbite. :) though IN that small talk, I'd talk about inane things, easy surface things. I'll bring up the fact I have a boyfriend if it's necessary to the topic, but I try not to be one of those girls that shuts down a dude from even just a conversation by shouting out she has a bf.	Mine got all crossed around somehow, so my casual friendly does hit a lot of more typical flirty behavior. My actual interest in someone, both romantically and those be my friend type crushes, reads as awkward, stilted, and vaguely something like I don't like them at all. I've spent years trying to reverse them back how they should be, but not much success. Essentially the stranger I am around someone, the more likely it is I have some sort of investment in them. My best guess is that my natural conversation style is flirty, but once I start being invested in the outcome my anxiety takes over and my normal conversational ease and confidence just goes right out the window.
When you played pretend as a child, what were you doing? who were you being?	I was usually playing house, or being an animal. Playing with my dolls was not cultural programming, nor was I encouraged to do so by parents, friends, teachers, or other adults.	I don't know about anyone else, but for me (in no particular order and not an exhaustive list) * Aliens * Superheroes * Mermaids * Mythical creatures * Astronauts * Jungle explorers * Warriors * Scientists * Witches * Secret agents * Detectives * Native Americans * Tree spirits * Magical * Gladiators * Pioneers * Gods/goddesses/heroes * Book characters/in book worlds
What aspects of traditional gender roles do you like?	I enjoy chivalry (a lot of it is just basic courtesy; I do "chivalrous" things like hold the door open for men and women alike). I like being the little spoon, when my SO wants to protect me (not necessarily because I need it but because he cares and has concern for me), and the guy making the first move.	This thread just makes me cringe because of the amount of "that's sexist", "you're giving us roles based on our gender only" and generally hostile answers. To answer the question, I like wearing dresses and skirts, and being "delicate".
What are the worst lingering habits/insecurities that were instilled in you as a kid and have followed you into adulthood?	If it feels good, I shouldn't be doing it. Unless it's work. Then if the work feels bad it's because I'm lazy.	My mom would call my name for the dumbest shit and then yell at me if I didn't respond immediately. Now every time someone calls my name or says "look" or something like that, I respond automatically. I feel like a trained dog.

Women who have broken up with a partner in order to start dating someone else, how did the the breakup/next relationship go?	So..I'm the horrible person who cheated and left him for that other guy. If I could change anything, I would first let him go before cheating. It was a 7 month relationship that became long distance and I couldn't handle the distance. I met another guy and we started off as fwb then eventually started dating. We've been with each other for about 7 years, married 4 and have a almost 1 yr old daughter. In my case, everything worked out great. I love him but I still feel like shit for what I did.	I was actually the person he broke up with someone for, but it kinda answers your question. There was a very brief period of overlap (like a week at most) between me and his girlfriend (feelings, no sex) but he said he wouldn't break up with her for another three months, because she was on her year abroad in Japan and he wanted to do it in person. Then one day out of the blue he dumped her over Skype and asked me out that evening. Then 18 months later he did the exact same thing to me when I was on my year abroad in Russia. I kinda deserved it. Edit - by overlap I mean there were the feelings that come from dating without actually dating, if that makes sense. We didn't start dating until after he broke up with her.
Minority men - How do you cheer yourself up after a bigoted encounter?	im a white guy who was walking over my lunch break once and got called a honky by a car full of guys. don't let someone else get you down.	I'm the only black guy in any of my Engineering classes and it became a thing for all the Middle Eastern guys to call me Will Smith for some reason. So to play it off with even more trolling I kept ensuring them when the world goes to shit I wouldn't give Abdul and friends the cure. (It was wrong to call them all Abdul) but I had to troll back.
What was the most infuriating case of workplace politics you've ever had to put up with?	I sell cars, so I work at a dealership where men in their 50s can become teenage girls in about half a second on the showroom floor. It can be an everyday thing or once a week, but one of the sales guys is one of the "dinosaurs" left in the industry (high pressure, talks about himself all the time, etc) and has no problem blowing up on the showroom floor whether there are customers or not. I love what I do, but don't always love who I do it with.	Had a system outage that stopped 75% of the company from being able to do any work. Instead of fixing it right away and then figuring out what happened, my team lead (Applications) and another team lead (Systems) stopped both teams from doing anything with it. They then spent 3 days having meetings and sending emails behind each others back to various different department heads explaining why it wasn't their fault and that the other team was to blame. The head of the IT department was retiring, so they were both hoping to get promoted. I had to work that weekend with someone from the Systems team to fix the problem because "too much time has already been wasted on this". The only silver lining was neither of them got the promotion.
What do you expect from your partner that you can't tell them?	You can remind your current partner that you like sex and can always breakup and find someone more their speed.	Trust and communication is the number one key to a fulfilling marriage. Without trust there is nothing. Sex is 3rd on my list. I did not get married to never have sex again. That marriage contract provided by the state says, I will only have sex with you for the rest of my life, unless we communicate about it first.
Does anyone else have no idea whether or not you're attractive?	I don't know, I kind of think I look fairly similar to other people. I have brown hair, I'm tall and skinny. Like I don't have any kind of unusual or interesting thing like bright orange hair or something.	i've no clue. my self-perception ranges from a 4-6, so at the very least i'm plain and at the most i'm kind of cute but nothing to look at again. i've never been approached in public by a man or anything like that, and i keep reading on reddit how that happens to attractive women, and thus i've deduced that i'm not attractive. but i went clubbing the other week and two girls walked up to me to call me pretty, and i've had a boyfriend for years, so i'm probably not *completely* dreadful.
What kind of alcoholic drinks do you recommend for a beginner (a.k.a. a lightweight that doesn't like the taste of beer)?	I would do Vodka, Sprite and a splash of Grenadine. Or a Long Island Ice Tea. Or margarita, frozen with sugar on the rim. I still don't like the taste of most alcohol.	I always recommend vanilla vodka and cranberry juice, which tastes like cherry cheesecake, or pineapple juice and Malibu rum just because it tastes like juice. Those are usually my go-to drinks when I'm out just because I'm not really a fan of the taste of strong alcohol.
Ladies who live with your SO, do any of you have a vastly different diet from your SO? How do you manage meals?	I'm mostly vegan and my SO is only vegetarian on Tuesdays (yes that sounds weird, but it's one day a week for his mom). Luckily for us, his mom sends him home on Sundays with 2 dinners and a lunch - Usually chicken. We don't buy meat when we go grocery shopping, mostly because of the cost. On days he does not have dinner, we usually have some combination of tofu/vegetables/pasta/potatoes. He likes what I make so it works out. We usually have pizza once a week and quesadillas once a week for which I use fake cheese and he uses real cheese. And sometimes on weekends we'll go out for burgers or (real) pizza and that's when I'll eat meat, cheese, and whatever.	Yeah actually, almost the same issue. My husband decided to stop eating carbs when I was a vegetarian, and he can be picky about vegetables. We both compromise. I started eating meat (for a variety of reasons) as long as it's ethically sourced -- it costs a million dollars but it's worth it to me. I keep pasta/rice/bread meals to a minimum but sometimes that's what I'm making and if he wants something different he's on his own. I also hide vegetables in his food. For instance, when I make lentil soup, I put in tons of veggies and then take an immersion blender to it so you can't tell what's in there. When I make chili, I put a big pile of veggies through the food processor before dumping them in the pot. As long as he doesn't know about them, he loves them.
What's the best part about having a daughter?	Figuring out how you're going to scare the shit out of all of her boyfriends. My favorite one is cleaning your guns and telling them "I'd do anything for my daughter. Anything."	One of the best things for me is knowing that I have to be the male model in their lives. It keeps me honest and working hard to be the best man/dad/husband I can be.

Houseplant obsessed people: What are your hacks? Was it easier to learn about plants online or from a book? How did you learn to not kill plants? etc?	My fiancé says filtered water makes all the difference. I always used tap water and killed my plants. He keeps his plants alive with filtered water.	Easier to learn online. For my garden I have a few books I always reference, but it's just easier to google the needs of individual houseplants. For me the biggest thing was don't overwater! Lots of plants die from neglect but it's just as easy to overdo it. Practice makes perfect and you get a feel for it along the way. I ❤️plants
How do you flirt with locals when you're a foreigner?	The same way you do with your local women. Btw I would pretend not to know french. I've heard most people in major European cities know English better than you'll know their language. And I think the French hate the French Canadian.	You also have plenty of advantages as a foreigner. Basicly, you are playing in god mode. First, you have a conversation starter: you are new here and try to meet people. Second, you have a different culture and learning the local culture or explaining your own make for good conversation. Third, people don't expect you to be as sharp as a local when it comes to language and alike. You are a foreigner, they are forgiving and don't expect subtle playwords. Finally, foreign is intriguing and generally sexy. Source: I'm french, lived in the netherland, denmark, japan and the usa.
Do any other women here become an awkward penguin when trying to talk to other women?	I can totally relate to this! I have more guys friends than girls and feel a greater sense of ease when communicating with men on a friendship level than women. I just find men more easy going and funnier than women. As well my mom is my best friend and my go to for shopping, dining out and movies (other than my SO). And yes I also feel awkward around a lot of women when conversing or getting to know them as there seems to be a greater sense of competition and manipulation between female friendships. However, I think quality or quantity is the thing to look for with female friendships. If you meet the right woman or women you will feel more at ease. They are out there just need to find them--usually a few glasses of wine helps me ;) Good luck!	In my head: oh my gosh this woman is JUST like me, were gonna be best friends! What I say: I like your shirt! Her: thanks *silence*
Men who grew up with a “nice guy” father and a controlling mother, how did you overcome the aftereffects?	I'd love to know the exact opposite too: Men who grew up with a good person for a mother, and a controlling immoral father, how did *you* overcome the aftereffects?	Distance helps and make a concerted effort in the women that you pursue. Make every effort not to replace your mother with a woman just like her.
How important is sex to you in a relationship?	How important is marriage in a relationship....ZERO. WTF dude you are seriously considering entering into a one sided legal agreement and you are only in your mid 20's? Why?	I have respect for people who choose not to have sex until marriage - i think it takes dedication and willpower to achieve that. BUT, i also think it's a bit stupid. Sexual compatibility is a huge part of a relationship in my book, and I'd never marry a girl without knowing what she's made of.
What sacrifices were you willing to make for an ex in order to make a future work, but now that they're an ex you're glad you no longer have to make those sacrifices?	Keeping my mouth shut because anything other than immediate agreement made him angry. Okay, may be I wasn't so happy about it. But I was doing it.	My ex husband came from a very family-first culture and we made a lot of financial sacrifices paying for shit for the extended family. I dont mind doing what i have already done and no regrets, but i am glad my current boyfriend comes from a family where people pay for their own shit.
Men of reddit, what is the most disgusting thing you do in private?	Play with my cumstring after masturbating. Sometimes I fling it around like a sticky hand and see how far it stretches	I found rock candy on the dirty as floor of my car, got super excited and put it in my mouth. It was just a rock.
What thing, serious or not, you don’t really like in your SO, but look past it because you love them?	His grandfather is a trump supporter and is VERY rascist, both my boyfriend and i are mexican and african. He also kills animals and has fur coats His father is a "hunter" and is very violent. On friday he grabbed my partners throat and threatened to kill him with me sitting there, ive never been more scared for my life But my actual partner is almost perfect, the only thing i dont like is his views on abortion (like he even deserves an opinion, he doesnt have a uterus;he wouldnt ever get one) and him eating meat.	*His unwillingness to see a doctor when he is sick.* Seriously, I don't get it and it's obviously bad for his health
Do any of you actually *like* emotionally needy or emotionally high maintenance girls?	As a Mentally Ill person the replies on here are making me sad. No one cares about us. No one at all.	I tend to like moderately to highly emotional girls, because I have a very small range of emotion most of the time and it's nice to have someone who complements that. I have also been told that my emotional disconnect makes it easier for me to comfort her or give advice.
Women with body dysmorphia, what are your coping strategies?	I don’t own a scale any more. It lies anyway. I used to have all these strategies for scales, like peeing before getting on and weighing myself first thing in the morning before I ate anything. Honestly, I am pretty sure I weight upwards of 20 pounds more than high school but I still fit in my prom dress, so intellectually I know weight means nothing. I like high waisted jeans for holding in the belly, and I just don’t have full length mirrors any longer either.	I try to look at my body as a whole. Sure, my thighs might be big, but with the rest of my body they look quite decent. Other people don’t see all the details like we do. They don’t just see “fat thighs” or “soft stomach”, they see a whole living, capable body Another thing that has helped me has been what my body can do - I can work for whole days at the shelter now, which is amazing! At one point i could hardly go for a walk without needing to sit down, now I’m on my feet for 9 damn hours and it feels GOOD. And those thighs make that possible, damnit. So i gotta accept them and care for them, cuz they make living life a possibility
What are some of the funniest or most ridiculous questions you remember reading here?	What do you think when you see a man eating a muffin in a cafe? Oh... and who remember [the ramp?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1js60w/how_common_is_the_ramp/) Edit: possibly NSFL link	I hate the ones that are like WHY DO WOMEN DO THIS THING THAT MEN ALSO DO BUT MY QUESTION HEAVILY IMPLIES THAT I THINK ONLY WOMEN DO IT or questions that are oddly specific. Like "why do women wear gray contact lenses?" was one from years ago that is an example of both.
Men on OkCupid, does it suck for you as much as it does for me? Also, if you could invent a better app, what would be different about it?	Yeah, I'm really starting to dislike it more and more. The huge issue that pops up to me is that I'll start kinda seeing someone, and ditch all OKQ activity for a week or two, while we're texting. Then when the puppy-dog hangout phase ends and something on there gives me a notification, I'll get on there and see that she's on there and I get a sinking feeling in my gut. I really hate the "Online now!" feature, it's great for seeing who's not around anymore (and not worth messaging), but it makes me feel like shit when I see the girl I'm interested in is shopping around for better options.	I've had a fair amount of success on Tinder. It really pays to know your demographic and have a targeted, even polarizing profile with pictures that convey who you are and not just what you look like. If motorcycles are a big part of your life, have a great picture taken with you riding your bike. If you are happiest dancing, have a picture of that.
What would you think if the girl you’ve been dating gave you a topless Polaroid photo?	Trust me on this. Don't send the photo. Here's what'll happen: * he might open it at an inappropriate time making it embarass him * he might open it and then get worked up and blueballed * (worst case) he'll think you have no morals for sending such stuff INSTEAD, I recommend you write up a really romantic letter. Bonus points if you include artistically drawn hearts and lots of girly handwriting. THEN, when you end up coming home, if you can arrange it, arrange it so that you end up at home before he gets done with work or something. Then when he walks in that door, greet him topless. He will ravish you.	Very attractive and a good kind of weird. There's something about the physical feeling of paper that you don't get with digital photos on your phone and it feels a lot more intimate, at least to me. It's quite the surprise.
What is the most rediculous request you have seen at a wedding?	I dunno if this is strange but I've always (and I mean since I was a kid) wanted to invite sick kids to my wedding with their parents. It would be a fund raiser for the parents and I would invite kids that were safe enough to get around. They would have their own play room with nurses. Their parents would enjoy free food and drinks. You know how people give money to the bride and groom? Well that money would go to the hospital specifically for their treatment plan. I never heard of something like this happening at weddings so I think it's strange.	I was a bridesmaid in a wedding where they paired up each white person with a black person, so they could walk down the isle together. The couple asked every black person they knew to be a bridesmaid or groomsman, so they could find the right amount of people. The couple were both white and thought it would be cool to show how inclusive they were. I thought it was a little odd myself.

I cried so hard it hurt. I could never watch it again and I loved it. The relationship between the son and his dad was so amazingly touching, the whole movie was so real and so positive and so well done, but good lord I was a puddle about half way through. I don't think I've ever cried so hard in my life.
Do men get scared walking home alone at night, too?	It would be stupid for anyone not to be scared about walking home alone at night, especially depending on the area you live in. But at the same time, there's this prevailing idea that women should always be *really* scared when they're alone. Not just when it's dark or late or if they're in a bad area, but everywhere. It makes all women a lot more afraid than they should be. Especially when you consider that men are more likely to be the victims of violent crime.	I get jumpy in bad areas. My response is closer to extreme wariness instead of just fear. I start checking corners as a approach them, checking my six frequently, keeping an eye out for escape routes if I need to bolt. Situation awareness is comforting.
Is being falsely accused of rape something that you worry about on the regular?	Never have, never will. I've only seen men on Reddit overly concerned about this. This is another one of those "Reddit only" things. Like women hitting men, "man hating" feminists, people thinking a BMW is some exotic "rich man's car" and anyone who drives one is a terrible driver, and of course: moms glaring at single men who are in the vicinity of a child.	Yes, but more in the context of "Man, I generally hope that doesnt happen." When I actually think of the individual women that I have been involved with in my life, I am almost positive none of them would ever do something like that.
Guys, what have been your experiences when going on a "break" with a girl?	Most likely she found a more attractive dick, but she hasn't been able to seal the deal yet. If she can't she'll come back to you.	Ive never been so naive to fall for that. It's basically a non commital breakup that gives the relationship a kiss of death.
Anyone else confident when single but an insecure mess in a relationship? Why do you think that is the case?	Guy here. Monogamy does it to me. I've put all my eggs in one basket and I'm hoping she's done the same. The paranoid side of me comes out thinking "I need to be aware and catch her so I don't throw away months or years of my life with a cheat". Currently in a non monogamous relationship and it's great. Emotionally I'm all hers, but I sleep around too, so I know that at any time we could part ways for whatever reason and I won't feel cheated. Say what you want, but it works for me.	When you're single, you have nothing to lose. If things don't work out with someone, you just move onto the next one. In a relationship, you're likely invested and don't want to lose them. So you worry about screwing things up.
In terms of a relationship, how do you deal with the transition period between just meeting/starting out and actually becoming a couple?	"... communicating non stop." Curtail that. "... dinner with my friends..." Too soon. I'd typically do solo dates for a couple months. If you see each other once a week that's 8 dates. The relationship determining conversation happens naturally at that point. Over-eagerness is perceived as neediness.	Go on your date tonight. If you guys have fun, just say "Hey, I had a great time tonight. Can we do this again soon?" Rinse, repeat, etc. If she makes other plans, no big deal. People are busy. Just do the best you can do.

What are some simple tips and tricks to get make getting ready in the morning go a little faster/easier?	Get a job that doesn't require a polished appearance. I'm a uniform girl through and through and I love it. I don't waste money on clothes I don't want, but have to for work and getting dressed takes a nano second. Sounds extreme, but unless you LOVE your job, why not go find something that works for YOU instead of the other way around? At least in part. And shower at night. I can't shower in the morning. i try but I just stand there for hours lol	I always prepare my clothes the night before and lay them near by bed so that when I need to, I can get dressed in under two minutes.
Men of Reddit who have been falsely accused of rape. How did you handle it and what was the outcome?	I'm gonna double down with the first guy, deny deny deny. A false rape accusation if it goes far enough can ruin your life. Also stop fucking people that are one person away from your co worker. If she hates you so much that she is trying to get people to file a fucking rape report then she's very clearly a fucked up bitch. To be honest I would find a new job too. I would also key that bitches car and slash her tires. That's me though. What the fuck did you do to that feminist to get her to hate you so much? I know feminists hate penis but Jesus dude.	My coworker accused me of rape. There was an internal investigation done by the company and they determined that it was consensual and she was lying (she had told another coworker of ours specifically that it was consensual). That wasn't the end of it though, shortly after the police contacted me wanting to ask me some questions, I cooperated and answered their questions and took a polygraph. Later that day the detective in charge said he had come to the same conclusion the company had and that she was lying. I was off the hook criminally but out of a job since they decided to fire us both anyways. I don't know if she was charged with falsifying a police report or anything. Fucked me up for quite some time, I couldn't understand why someone would so ruthlessly try and ruin my life.
Is it weird I feel more insecure about my bf looking at /r/gw than if he were looking at hardcore porn?	I think you're just being insecure. It's just another form of porn. As long as he isn't interacting with them I don't think you should care. I know I don't. Interacting with them is where the line is for me.	I can understand how you feel. It's way more personal. I don't care what my bf jerks it to, but if he was having conversations with girls he's jerking it to, I'd feel a little betrayed. That's crossing a line for me. That's why gw is a problem for me, not because it's amateur, but because those girls are able to talk back. They aren't just pictures, they're people. And I expect to be the only person in my bf's sex life during a relationship.
What would you do if your girlfriend said this to you?	This is prob a reflection of internal insecurity. She doesn't think shes attractive enough to hold the interest of a "hot guy". She thinks of you as attractive to her, but doesn't consider you so attractive that she needs to worry about a girl with more to offer coming along and stealing you. I honestly wouldn't take it personally. That's prob impossible and I def see how that would hurt you, but she was trying to be honest.	It's such a shitty thing to say. First off she's saying that we're not very attractive, second she's saying no other woman would want me, and thirdly she's saying if other women did want me I couldn't be trusted anyway. It's just an all around terrible thing to say and I don't think I could date somebody who thinks so little of me.
How to properly go about forgetting someone that you can’t?	guess what.... you dont. an thats not a bad thing. learning to accept and live will come in time. right now its ok to feel your feels.	Time heals all wounds. In the mean time just find a hobby or something to get your mind off of it.
What are the unwritten rules of texting?	If you end a text with a period, I will assume you are being a jerk / are pissed at me. Example: Ok that's sounds fine! Ok, that sounds fine Ok. That sounds fine.	If you send someone a text, and they don't reply, don't send them 15 more texts about their lack of reply. Maybe like one a day later if you actually *needed* a reply and it was important.
How does one recover from accidentally telling their girlfriend that they don't think they're hot?	Jesus Christ, kid. If you could be honest with women like that, this subreddit wouldn't exist. It's a rookie mistake and we hate to see it.	*Catastrophically stupid man tells girlfriend he doesn't think she's hot after she tells him he is hot, learns valuable life lesson of thinking before speaking for his next girlfriend. More at 11.*
Ladies of AskWomen, who settled down with someone that had one of your major dealbreakers, what was that dealbreaker and how did you get past it or finally feel comfortable in that relationship?	I’m the person who has the dealbreaking behavior. He likes my privates shaved but I stopped shaving my privates a few years ago. I sometimes trim, though (usually when he wants to give me oral).	One of my dealbreakers, after being married to a sports fanatic for 18 years was that I would never date someone who was really into sports. My current bf is a professional sports bettor, so as you can imagine, he watches sports constantly. The difference is that he doesn’t let it dictate our lives like my ex-husband did. If I want to do something or watch something else, he is always willing to oblige.
Why are the stereotypes describing men who are losers nearly universal when the female counterpart remains kind of vague? What are some traits that make you think a woman is a loser?	Locking this thread after the sheer amount reports I'm getting of people arguing. If you can't play nice then no one get to play	Locking this thread after the sheer amount reports I'm getting of people arguing. If you can't play nice then no one get to play
How do you feel about "Women Only" events and businesses?	Do you think a a Men Only business or event would be successful? I think this was also known as History.	I feel in two minds about a lot of things. On the one hand I see the need for a place to be able to do the stuff you want to do without having to deal with flirting and ogling guys. On the other hand exclusion is one of those things that rubs me the wrong way, because it is a one sided thing as there would be a massive problem if people made a man only yoga studio or gym which clashes with the wish for equality between everyone. So I've decided the subject is too nuanced for me to actually care that much because women having their own place doesn't hurt anyone and it pretty much devolves into a non-issue the more I think about it.
What was the defining moment where you found your self-respect?	For me it was a steady improvement. Once I stopped putting women on pedestals I was probably in my mid to late 20s. I had some other stuff going on in my life that allowed me to become 100% confident, and happy with myself. It was a refreshing change in my life. Haven't been happier.	When I stood up for a friend that was being heavily picked on in high school. I liked the guy so Fuck those people. We are still friends nearly 20 years later.
Ladies (and gents), do you think its possible to be in a relationship with someone you love, even though the sex is awful or nonexistent?	If you are willing to give up sex then I don't think it's impossible. As for "bad sex" I really think there's no such thing as bad sex, just lack of communication! It can be a touchy subject because you don't want to offend the other person or make them feel inadequate or that they don't satisfy you sexually but it's not something that can't be fixed. Personally for me I could not be in a relationship where the sex was bad (and I have been, back when I was younger and embarrassed to bring up the subject!) I don't want to sound like a nympho freak but I love sex too much (with my partner, I am not a crazed slut or anything) I couldn't be in a sexless relationship.	I see this from time to time: Good sex is 10% of a relationship, bad sex is 90%. Sex is one of the big things that differentiates friendship from a romantic relationship. If it's nonexistent or bad, I would go. But really, I couldn't imagine actually progressing to a serious relationship at all if the sex was bad.
What things are you sick of being listed as dealbreakers?	Liking astrology it's fun and fascinating for some people and it isn't be a big deal. I see men get so ott about it.	Mental Illness. I get it, I do, but mine is managed well enough that none of my SO's knew until I told them. Just a minor annoyance.
Would you love your child more than your wife?	No. I already talked about this to my stable girlfriend - if we're ever going to have a kid, we will remain each other's top priority, otherwise I'm not having a kid.	Dad here. Sometimes one partner puts too much attention on the kid, and the SO doesn't get enough quality time. That doesn't mean one is loved more. But it might FEEL like it. Both need attention. If I have a problem with it, and I need more time with my wife, I'd talk to her about it. If she needs more time with me, then she should talk about it like any rational adult. One of our biggest things was my wife needed time with me and away from the baby. So we arranged baby sitters for that, usually they were relatives.
What was the worst mistake you have made at work?	On my first day as an intern, I moved my chair in a way so that the back of a huge bookcase would fall right onto my pregnant boss's desk. Luckily someone moved her out of the way. I quit the next day for unrelated reasons.	First day as an intern I dropped a body and scratched a $10,000 casket so I'm gonna lead with those.
What's something you thought only existed on the internet that you've experienced in real life?	False rape accusations. Attempts at, or actual, 'anchor babies.' People that lick their fingers before separating cash or pages of books - fuckin' ew. People that compare having pets to parenting in a non-ironic way Hombre hair coloring. I don't see why you'd dye your hair... in a way that looks like you can't afford to keep up the roots	Overweight young men in fedoras/trilbys. Once you know to look for them you start to see them here and there.
Dear Redditors, could you help me understand why men find my past weird?	> I went through high school thinking dating was really dumb (which it was at that age) and wasn't open to it. > In my first few years of university, I didn't meet anyone worthwhile, Frankly, you come off as egotistical, and pretentious, which *is* weird. Good for you for knowing what you want and being serious, but don't expect every candidate *you* find up to snuff to think along the same lines you do. Also, since you haven't dated, there's a good chance you only have a superficial idea of what you want, which means the prospective relationship is already off to a rocky start from his eyes. EDIT: Format	It's unusual and thus weird, but there's nothing wrong with that. You know what you want and what you don't want. That's fine. At the same time, you probably shouldn't just assume guys your age are only looking for hookups. I'm sure there are plenty of guys your age that are looking for long term relationships. I was when I was 20.
Dad's of Reddit, what is the number one tip you can give to someone who just found out his wife is pregnant?	Remember. It's not "my wife is pregnant" it's "We are pregnant". It's a shared experience. There best part of this is that it works both funny and serious.	Great advice here, but on the more serious side of things, I know you’re excited, but don’t start telling people yet. Miscarriage is SUPER common (20% of pregnancies abort in the first trimester). No one takes about it ever, but it really fucking sucks, and it’s 10x worse when you have to “untell” everyone you told. People don’t know how to react, and it’s really painful and weird for everyone involved. Absolutely no announcements on Facebook yet, and honestly don’t tell anyone you wouldn’t be comfortable untelling. But now that that shitty lecture is over, congratulations! Really try to step up the housework and patience on your part, because your poor wife is about to be really sick and miserable for a couple months. And don’t take it personally when mood swings go nuts around week 8-9.
How do you explain why Internet is filled with men clearly hating women? Does it bother you?	We have had to remove a large amount of derailing content from this thread. Just as a reminder, do not try to turn this thread into any subject other than what is reflected in the question. Things this thread is about : Pockets on the internet filled with men hating women. Things this thread is *not* about: Evil feminazis. Thank you.	We have had to remove a large amount of derailing content from this thread.

Does anyone really only spend time with their SO?	Nope. My boyfriend and I are really independent people. We obviously enjoy being together, but maintaining separate groups of friends is extremely important to both of us. We have separate hobbies as well. Even when we go so social events, we immediately part ways to interact with others (touching base over the course of the evening). This is the type of relationship I've always preferred to have.	Aside from work (where I sit in a cubicle wearing headphones and have little interaction with my coworkers), I spend the bulk of my interaction time with my SO. Most of my friends don't live in this city, or we've grown apart, so I don't see my own friends very often. I hang out with my SO's friends (with or without him) maybe once a month, otherwise my social interaction is mainly with him. It bothers me a little because if we break up I'm probably going to become a hermit, but I was a hermit before we met and I did all right. I like it though. He's the only person I don't find it draining to be around, because we're capable of sitting in the same room, doing different things, together but not. And I like the quiet little life we've made for ourselves.
What "terrible" advice is actually good advice?	"Be yourself". A lot of people take this advice literally and thus scoff at it, but it is a bit more complex than it sounds. If "being yourself" reveals you being a horrible and unattractive person, then by all means change who you are so that you not only *look* better to others, but also *feel* better yourself. Otherwise, do what you enjoy or are good at, and be your *best* natural self.	"Whoever cares more, loses." It's horrible to think about, but generally true. I wouldn't advise anyone to stop caring, but sometimes you have to recognize that you're putting yourself in an unwinnable situation.
What is your cause and what can I change about my daily lifestyle to further it?	Mine is animal rights and the environment. I'm a vegan and believe in speciesism. Watch Earthlings and stop consuming animal products. Stop going to zoos and aquariums. Don't buy your pets from breeders, take in rescues instead. And so forth.	Homelessness. Donate food to shelters and food banks - NOT expired packets of ranch seasoning that have been sitting in the back of your cabinet, donate things that won't just need to be thrown out by an employee or volunteer as soon as they're delivered. Volunteer with a shelter. Do it regularly. You'll learn how easy it is to become homeless and how difficult it is to get out of it. You'll meet people, and help people. You might get a free meal out of it, I work at a shelter and we always feed volunteers if there isn't a food shortage. The food is often surprisingly delicious.
What's more of a turn off? A man who dances like an idiot or a man who doesn't dance at all. What are your thoughts on the matter?	if someone isn't willing to put themselves out there and have a bit of fun, then it shows you the level of confidence they have. you can always improve on dancing, but if you're too scared to even try, that says a lot	A man who dances if he feels like it, doesn't if he doesn't, and also won't pressure me to do so - I'm really self conscious about dancing, mainly because the only way I could be worse at it is if I chopped a leg off.
Have you or someone you know been a victim of revenge porn, what happened, what did you do?	when i was in highschool, i had a crush on an older guy that was a senior when i was a freshman but had since graduated. he ended up going to the army after graduation, and one particular night BEGGED me to send him a sexy pic, swearing up and down he was "all alone" in his "bunk." Maybe 30 minutes later i get a text from a coworker of mine that also was alumni of my high school asking if i had a red bra on. this dude wasn't deployed at all, he was at a poker game five miles away, and showed everyone the photos. Needless to say i was mortified, and very hurt, seeing as this was before FB and i just trusted he was away.	When I found out my ex posted pictures to several different sites I went straight to the police to file a report. I had a protective order against him (he was abusive) and I felt like this was a violation of that. The detective flat out told me there was nothing they could do. She said they couldn't prove that it was him that out up all the pictures. He has posted my name, my Facebook pictures, where I lived, and all the explicit photos he took when we were together. She told me next time I shouldn't take let someone take pictures of me so this wouldn't happen. I was MORTIFIED. I felt that he still had control of my life. This was a year go, and he's still posting pictures. I feel so lost and powerless against him.
Do you ever miss the person you used to be?	I feel like I am not as nice and sweet as I was when I was younger, however you know how the saying goes...”different people bring out different sides of you”	Not really. Honestly, I'm a far more improved version of myself than anything else, because my tastes haven't changed. I'm still a damn giant nerd with an obsession with cute stuff. My confidence & stuff has gotten better.
Do you treat prettier women better? If so, how?	Honestly it's probably the opposite, because I see they're really pretty and then I start to assume I have no chance, and/or that I would receive no understanding from them about my needs or desires or how I'm hurting and what effect their beauty has on me. In fact I start to assume they'd probably want to call me a pig or creep for what I can't help feeling. So, I start to feel resentful. I don't say mean things or anything, I just will probably be a little colder than I would with someone I wasn't attracted to. OTOH, a pretty girl who through some means gets across that they *do* understand and accept how I feel, as rare as that seems to be these days, they get my full decency and then some in return.	I'm sure that I do, but I'm also sure that it's largely unconscious and a sort of generalized across the board effect.
Clitoris-only orgasmic women, what positions and/or methods do you employ during vaginal sex to ensure you orgasm?	Missionary, despite my love of kink 😆 Ahem. That way, penus/toy is able to hut all the right spots & I can just focus on using my Hitachi wand. I can't imagine using anything less. It's either that or the weight of my hips. But hey, I hope to find other positions & things that work ^.^ (Also also, people who only orgasm from clit stimulation is like, almost all of us)	Surprised to see no one saying on top. I’m a CO orgasimer and I can only make it to the top of the mountain while on top. Doesn’t happen every time but the natural rubbing of the position mixed with my SO squeezing my bum is the only way to get there
What is something you know that you wish you didn't?	Not eating starch (glucose) causes hair loss. Not eating meat means you have to supplement. Eating out means generally eating poison unless you spend a whole lot of money eating at the finest places.	When I was in high school, I found my parents' sex pictures. It was so unexpected and out of place, I stared at them way longer than I should have trying to figure out what the fuck I was looking at. It looked like legit amateur porn or something, and I didn't realize they were my parents until it was far too late. I wish I could forget.
Why do you get approach anxiety and what can we girls do to help?	Don't assume a guy is "creepy" just because you think he is unattractive and showing interest in you. There are creepers out there, but girls really overuse that term and it really stigmatizes alot of nice guys.	Why I get approach anxiety. I don't know how she'll act when I talk to her. Some chicks can give off that major bitchy vibe and kill the ego. How to help -Don't put all the conversational work on the guy. If you ask questions too it takes off a huge load on the guy.
Men who actually enjoy their 9 to 5 jobs, what is it that you do?	I'm not a man, but I am a forensic accountant and I love my job. I work from home and, as a morning person, like to get started around 530-6 and am finished by 230-3. I find my work very interesting, believe it or not, I know it's the epitome of a "boring job" but I get to look through other people's records, and have a tangible "output" in my job, which is satisfying and challenging. It's engaging and lucrative, but doesn't affect my life when I log out for the day - all in all, a perfect job for me	I'm a pizza cook. I make minimum wage but the pizza life is the life I love to live, plus minimum in Seattle is 13/hr so I'm not like SUPER poor right now. I see a lot of people, even at my job, hate kitchen work but I really can't see myself doing anything else as a day job, i really have a passion for pizza specifically
Ladies who were "late bloomers" in certain areas of life, how are things now? And what advice would you give to others in that position?	I was a late bloomer in terms of learning. I was at the bottom of my second-grade class for reading. I went from remedial level to advanced almost overnight. Something clicked and I just figured it out. From there on out, I always tested one to two grades higher in reading and writing. Same thing with learning how to tell time, math, etc.	I was the last girl in my grade to get my period. I was almost 16 and then it came once, and then did not come again for another nine months. DO NOT pretend that you have your period. You will have it for long enough. There is nothing wrong with you! Also, if you pretend you have it, then girls will be very suspicious when you ask for a tampon, but they see it fall out of your pocket four hours later....try explaining that one!
What's up with dudes not knowing how to wipe their butts?	I dated a physician in his early 50's that would leave brown streaks in his underwear. When I brought this to his attention he got upset and said that it was a normal thing. Dated a PhD in his mid 30"s with the same problem. When confronted same reaction and answer. The list goes on. Regardless of age, education or socioeconomic status... most men do not know how to wipe their ass.	I always assumed people who have problems with that are eating such horrible diets that every bathroom trip is a major toxic sludge cleanup job. More fiber, less grease. If you're regularly in there wiping all day something is wrong.
Where do I meet friends who consider me their 'first option' ?	Thats not how friendships work... you don't meet people than manipulate your way until people consider you #1. You find people that you GENUINELY get along with on a deeper level. A relationship goes two ways, if the feelings are not reciprocated than its not the relationship you think it is.	Cultivate individual friendships with multiple people in the same social circle. The more people in a group who have a personal relationship with you, the more logical it will be to include you in group activities. Build your own social circle. If you have friends who you think will get along, introduce them to each other. If you become a key social connection for people you will naturally be included. Have multiple social circles. If you are on the periphery of multiple groups, you are not reliant on any of them, so being excluded from certain activities is less important. Most importantly, stop caring so much. Most groups are wheels within wheels, right down to pairs of best friends, and everybody is sometimes excluded from something.
Have you ever gone to bed with a girl and then been shocked or put off by something once the clothes came off? Did either of you mention it at any point and how did you both react?	Wow, people can be douchey. It really doesn't matter. You wouldn't date someone for their car, right? So why would anyone pick a partner spirit based on their body? It's just a vehicle for the soul, man.	I once had a surprise with a skinny girl. I took off her bra to find no boobs. What I thought were her boobs were total padded bras. Her nipples were adult feminine, but she was truly flat chested. She completely made up for it with a vag of perfection, sexual enthusiasm and action, and no fear/shame of me playing with what boobage she did have.
How do you get yourself to doing things that would be beneficial in your life if done but scare you?	Disclaimer: Man Here. Fear breeds more fear... if it'll put you in a better place, do it. This life move might only put you in a slightly better place, for now.... but if you dont go through with it, that fear will be instilled deep within. So the next life move that comes up, might put you in a hugely better place... but you'll pass on it because you're afraid, and used to being afraid. Written like hell, but you'll get the jist. Be a fearless f&%*er	I get other people involved. I suck at keeping commitments to myself, but I always keep my commitments with others.
What is something you kept from your parents as a kid, but later told them in your adulthood?	Honestly, I'm pretty sure my parents knew everything. Even the things I *thought* I was keeping from them, they managed to know about. I was also a goody two-shoes, so nothing I did warranted hiding anyways. There's only one thing they never found out about, and I'm taking that secret to my grave.	That I dated in high school. She got angry that I had done that and went off on how irresponsible it was of me and that she told me over and over not to because it's a bad thing to do. Then she asked why I never told her. "because look how you're reacting! Why would I have wanted to tell you?"
Is "I'm only friends with guys because girls are too much drama," actually a thing?	Every girl I've met who has said this fit into one or both of these categories: * *She* is the actual catalyst of drama with other women * She has a flirtationship with most of the guys she's friends with	I went to an all-girl's catholic high school and had a horrible time of bullying, rumors and exclusion, and so I sort of developed this mentality because, in fact, the few friends I had were guys. Now that I'm an adult I've realized this was completely circumstantial and would never even think of saying this, let alone believe it. All it took was a few good female friends after graduation to teach me that not all women are cruel high school girls.
If a girl remembered a small detail, of a personal preference of yours, that you mentioned a long time ago, would you be flattered or weirded out?	OMG! PLease id love that id love for women to remember shit i told them....... i do how the heck would it be strange if you remembered something i said. If you dont il be confused and feel hurt that what i said you did not give a rats ass about and where just letting in one ear and out the other just to humor me.	I'm always very flattered when people remember minuscule details, because it makes me feel like they really listen to me when I speak, or they at least care enough to remember.
Girlfriend of eight months hasn't done anything to recognize my birthday. It was two weeks ago. How would you feel? Is it alright for me to upset?	I mean if you wanted something, you should have set expectations. You didn't say anything, you just let it go by. If you don't set expectations or mention it beforehand, then you can't really be surprised when nothing happens. She still should have done something though. Like come on. But I would phrase it in the sense that you're upset instead of "YOU DIDN'T DO THIS STUFF THAT I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT BUT EXPECTED NONETHELESS".	I mean, it's going to be awkward now that you waited so long. I can't imagine how this conversation will go. I'd just tell her I was bummed out we didn't do dinner or anything for my big day and see how she responds. Did you ever mention you don't like making birthdays a big deal?

Please be honest, what is it like to go down on a girl?	Boring. Hot, sweaty,slobbery. Cant breath, taste is meh. The stubble rubs like sand paper on my tongue lips and face. Eve. On a shaved girl there is always a few missed strands of hair too and that grosses me out. I really don't get the appeal of going down on a girl.	We need a FAQ for this. It comes up again, and again, and again. I would not buy pussy flavored candy or ice cream. However, I *love* to eat pussy knowing my SO is enjoying it. I *love* bringing her to orgasm using only mouth. It makes me feel like I''m an all-powerful sex god.
Do you guys enjoy the feeling of having a woman in your passenger seat?	What I like to do is turn up the heat so that she takes off her sweater. And then I turn on the AC so I can see her nipples get hard through her T-shirt.	Yep. And this might be atypical, but when they fall asleep is just a little ego boost. Something about them being feeling comfortable/safe enough with me and my driving to curl up in my passenger seat and trust that I'll get them there is nice. Especially if they told me they never sleep in cars or it's a difficult situation that makes almost anyone nervous like NYC traffic, a blinding snowstorm, etc.
Men with depression, do you date? If so, how do you overcome the negative thoughts while on a date?	Find someone who brightens your day whenever you see them. Like if when you don't feel like getting out of bed and just staying there, drinking and smoking and watching stupid YouTube videos all day, when you decide "fuck life and everyone!", but then you find out that you can meet them so you just crawl out and fight. And you go meet them and the day becomes better. But I'm with bi-polar 2, so I get good moments when it's easier to meet someone that would make me battle my depression days and make them better.	Yes. Communication is the key and telling your SO when you are on your darkest days is a must. I try to overcome them by staying busy and having a "me" session of self-improvement.
What is the deal with the impulse to give a house tour before you have sex with someone?	Where all the guys British? I was thinking that would be something you saw in the UK &#x200B; ha ha ha America Hell Ya! Get in the back of my pick-up truck lady!	I can already hear David Attenborough's voice *The male, having successfully brought a female into it's den, attempts to dazzle her with its ornaments and splendor. This being one of the more attractive females means his habitat will have to be that much more impressive. Her gaze wanders and subtly scans his living quarters... she's looking for dirt or anything amiss. The male is not aware of this, and tries to distract her with his autographed Reel Big Fish poster from 1999, carefully and intentionally placed above his bed. The female is not impressed.*
What is a trait your ex had that is now a deal-breaker for future partners? And why?	As it follows:Has any sort of anxiety/panic attack disorder/self identifies as crazy and keeps saying things like "you should run", I'll take those comments at face value now/anyone who's "disgustingly liberal",or anyone I have to explain to why I find it offensive when she generalizes everyone who enlists as dumb sociopathic racists who just want to murder brown people/body dysmorphia/asks me to get rid of friends/works in fashion.	Anger issues. My ex got mad at really little things, and would overreact. For example, his phone wasn't doing what he wanted it to do, so he threw it across the room, in turn breaking something else. I'll never deal with that again. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells so I didn't set him off.
What's the craziest reaction you've gotten when you told a girl you're not in the mood?	My Mom told me to shut it and go do my homework since I wasn’t in the mood to do my chores.	Best: Want me to just suck you off instead, so you don't have to do any work? Worst: Are you cheating on me with 'insert the name of any woman she has known longer than 5 seconds'?!? Am I not pretty enough? Is there something wrong with me? When did you stop loving me?
What's a big secret you really need to get off your chest?	I want desperately to get knocked up (tick tock) and my SO is infertile. He's totally on board with this conceptually. I don't really want to go through the rigmarole of official ways to do this, all the testing and whatnot - just want sperm. Fuck, spent my twenties not getting pregnant and now want just the opposite. Sigh - so much wasted sperm in my past, if only I'd had the foresight to harvest and put it on ice.	I just failed a law school midterm. I haven't told anyone, but when I think about it, I want to vomit. EDIT: If anyone sees this edit, thank you! You guys really cheered me up. Also, I just got my first paper back, and it has a high grade. Phew!

Ladies in the military, what should I know (what did you wish you knew) before signing up?	You should know exactly WHO you're fighting for and exactly WHAT you're fighting for. Basically the elites violent and insatiable lust for natural resources. Many innocent people are being murdered every day to satisfy this evil greed. As long as you know this reality.	While everyone here has given great advice as what it is like when you're in, know that the joining process is important, too. I'm leaving for Air Force basic training at the end of this month. It took me over a year to enlist, the other branches are much quicker. The recruiter may not openly lie to you, but mine tried to bully me into going open contract. I stood firm and landed a job that I really wanted. Go in knowing that the recruiters are there to make numbers, not to look out for your best interest. Some of them are actually good people but it's not worth the risk. Do your research. Google your questions. Gather your knowledge and make an educated decision.
What was a cringe/awkward moment a Woman misinterpreted a situation but you where just being friendly or polite?	I was on a hike by myself yesterday and a cute girl and her dog were crossing paths with me. The puppers ran over to me and she introduced the dog. The dog was named 'gorda' which means fat girl in spanish. As i walking away i just yelled, bye bye gorda!! I cringed thinking that she may have thought i called the owner a fat chick but oh well. She's got to get used to it!	Seems like this question comes up about once a week now... Flagged a girl down on the road, pulled my bike up to her driver-side window, she rolled it down and said "I have a boyfriend" I said "that's nice, but you have a flat tire" Then I wheeled into the sunset.
What are some fucked up things you've seen someone praised for?	I peed in a guy's dryer once at a party. Made a girl cry because I started calling her "Jugs" instead of learning her name. I've been a dick to make girls break up with me. Myself and several others worked together and over time took thousands of dollars from my job when I was 18. Drank so much my legs stopped working. Drank so much I passed out on the kitchen floor. A friend called me to pick her up from the bar because another friend wouldn't stop hitting on her. She said she'd fuck me if I did. I did. She had a bf.	When me and my brother were around 7(?) we lived in an apartment complex and had gotten bikes for Xmas. We were out riding and at one point gone inside for a minute leaving our bikes out front. Go back out and my brothers bike is gone. We knew who it was as there was this one shit kid always pulling crap. Go over to his apartment and both he and his mother answer the door and we say that he took our bike. His fucking mother looked to us, said it was his bike, looked to him and congratulated him on "His new bike." Needless to say, my father went over and immediately got my brothers' bike back .
What's the worst heartbreak you've suffered, and did you get through it?	Dated a lady for six-ish months before she ended up getting engaged to another dude. (their married now) Never felt more betrayed in my life. I’m still working on getting back on my feet. Baby steps I guess.	I’ve had a few heartbreaks. And each one helped me realise if I can get over one, I can get over another The thing about heartbreak is that we long for the GOOD feelings we experienced, the GOOD times. Which is why I consciously remind myself of the BAD times, the BAD feelings I experienced, even writing a list pf them and looking at them over again. Every time that longing happens, I remind myself of the fuckery that I hated (which is ultimately why it didn’t work out). Soon enough my nostalgic memories are more complete. The good and bad of it all. I create a healthy distaste for those times, no longer long for them, soon enough it just becomes something that happened in my life. It **will** take time. But this technique speeds up the process greatly.
Men who regret getting married, what’s your reason?	ITT: men who got divorce raped. Edit: the fact that I'm getting downvotes on this paints a really clear picture of what'll happen to you all... Don't say you weren't warned. At least get a prenup if you're thinking of being dumb enough to get married in today's world.	She never loved me. She married me because she thought it would force her to develop feelings. Waste of time
[Feedback!] People who've asked AskMen for advice: How did we do? How did it go?	Ugh, it was awful. I wanted advice on how to bring up the subject of a late period with someone I wasn't serious with, and all the comments were "teeheehee, your problem now cunt" edit: You'll see some people questioning me and downvoting in the children of this comment. That's what I mean by "the sentiment".	I was finally coaxed into trying boxer briefs. Solved all my issues with running and other workouts. Thanks guys! Edti: Oh, and also I got a tip about sterilizing my razor with alcohol before I shave. It has reduced my bumps noticeably.
My landlord came to do a "walk through" that actually turned out to be her giving her son a tour of the place I very much live in to see if he wants it. What is your latest "what the fuck is this shit?" moment?	Sorry, I don't meant to be rude, but isn't that the point of a walkthrough? To see if a possible tenant wants to lease the place?	My birthday. We had all planned to go out, and I recommended drinks before going to a club where this live band was playing. The day of my birthday, I texted everyone, but received no replies, so I assumed it was off. But, I received multiple snapchats from those friends celebrating without me, complete with drunk videos of themselves having the time of their lives. It was like, "Really?! Why would you do that?"
How many of you actually met your SO at a bar?	Reddit bar crawl. In short, we met, she asked me about my job, I told her not to ask me about my life, she asked if I'd be interested in getting together some other time, I said maybe, friends for a year and a half then started dating.	I did. Me: manager/roadie/sound guy of local band in college Her: came to a show at a college bar with her then bf, who was an acquaintance from class. After the show, he came over and said what's up, introduced me to his gf, and I remember thinking to myself "he ain't doing bad." Fast forward a few months later, they'd broken up, we were at the same party, and I was about 3/4 of the way through a case of southpaw. ended up making out on the side of the house for like an hour. That was about 16 years ago. married 11 years now and have two kids.
People who screwed up a relationship with a good partner, what's your story and what would you have changed?	I tried to turn her into a stronger person than she is. She has mental issues and I'm learning about Dom/sub life. It isn't just in the bedroom. It's every part of a couples life. The Dom makes important choices for the sub. Not a controlling asshole, which I don't want to be, but love based. The Dom gets fulfillment. Which I did. I think like a parent does whats best for a child. I tried to make her independent. She is not. She even commented once that she needs someone, like me to tell her things. I miss her.	My first "normal" relationship. She lifted me up. Raised my self esteem. So much that I began to get interest from other women. I broke up with her to pursue others... She met someone else pretty quickly, got pregnant, married, etc, as did I, but I shouldn't have hurt her like I did.
Married redditors, how did you and your spouse decide last names?	We wanted to have the same last name, he had a professional career with his name already, I didn't. I took his name.	I was born with 5 names and the only thing I cared about was no hyphenating. I was still in grad school upon marriage, published under my maiden name. So I was adamant about keeping my name till graduation, then just.... Kinda never legally changed it. A family name is important to my husband, so I use his informally and socially, but kept mine legally and in my career
Do you think it is selfish or otherwise wrong to have a child if you suffer(ed) from depression?	My father has depression. My grandfather has depression. I have depression. This ends here. I will never in a million years have a kid and pass this on. I would sooner kill myself than have another kid and pass this on. I would sooner destroy the entire world killing everyone on it before I passed this on. My genetic line will end here. I don't know about other people but the most disgusting thing in the world ever is putting someone else in the world that has to deal with this. And I do mean ever.	Selfish to have a child as a means of alleviating your depression: yes. Same as for people who have a child due to boredom, to keep a relationship going, status symbol, etc. [The... probability of actually achieving said intent is rather irrelevant to whether it is selfish. Many people who have a kid due to these reasons are not particularly successful.] Selfish to have a child because you want one, but just happen to suffer from depression? No.
What's your view on your SO having an opposite gender best friend?	Depends about that guy. There is so many factors that its hard to judge. If he would be better looking than me, smarter, richer etc, then Houston we have a problem. I am not really tolerant person.	I have a question in addition to this one - does it matter how long they have been best friends? I have a male best friend but we've been friends since 7 years old, so it's not like he became my friend in order to get me into bed.
What do you love about being a man?	Ok I didn't like growing up to be a man. But once society is done drilling us into be confident, strong, self-reliant, resourceful human beings, things are the shit. Women grow up sheltered and used to getting things for free. Men have had to work for everything all their lives. That pays off in the end.	My body is, comparatively at least, is low maintenance. The relationships females have with each other are way too political for me. The social aspect of being a man is also very low maintenance. TL;DR Being a man is low maintenance.
Mothers that have achieved this, how have you been able to keep or get back your own individual identity separate to being 'mum'?	Being mum IS part of my identity. I love my children, will not deny them to celebratey my “own individual identity“ and have not lost any part of me worth keeping I think. I am now more caring, altruistic and happier than ever so I do not miss the old me. “Mum“ is not something bad and having children transforms you (most hopefully) to something even better. Copy with your new identity and stop mourning you are not a child anymore yourself.	I regained my identity when I went back to work. For the first few months everyone still focused on the baby and asked the usual “mom” questions, but over time I just did my job and for 8 hours a day it was like nothing changed. I also make sure I schedule hang out time with my friends who don’t have kids. I love my friends with kids but when we get together we tend to only talk about our kids and our shared gripes. There’s nothing wrong with that and I think it’s important to share our experiences but when I meet up with my kid-free friends we talk about a variety of things (concerts, books, politics, movies) that make me remember that I’m my own person with interests and experiences that are separate from my daughter.
What decisions have you found easy to make, despite most people saying they should be difficult decisions?	Sticking to a healthy diet and exercising. Eating unhealthy and being inactive makes me feel so bad. I don’t understand how it’s easy for people to live like that	I’d rather be single than with a guy who isn’t terrible, but isn’t great for me either; i.e., I’d rather be single than settle. My friend says that I’m a “strong, independent woman” because of this, but I really don’t feel like I’m making a difficult choice here. I don’t think I’m particularly confident or strong in other areas of life, I just genuinely don’t mind being single. I’ve dated “okay” guys and while it was hard for me to break it off because I don’t like to hurt other people’s feelings, I didn’t feel bad for myself and never questioned my decisions. On a related note, I don’t have a problem cutting out a toxic friend once I’ve realized the extent of the negative impact s/he is having in my life.
How/when did you know he/she was NOT the one?	When he told me that he didn't want to listen to sad love songs or any music that wasn't upbeat because it was bad for his mental health.	At one point during the relationship my ex said something like, "don't you think I'd be a good father?" After I thought about it I realized that he was one of the more immature, irresponsible people I knew with a bad temper and that he's not even a good boyfriend, let alone someone who should be parenting.
Would you rather change gender every time you sneeze, or not be able to tell the difference between a muffin and a baby?	I'd rather change *sex* every time I sneezed. Changing gender would mean I'd still physically be a woman, but I'd feel like a man inside my head.	Change gender. It would make life interesting. Like, idk about you all, but I often sneeze a few times in a row. Plus, I bet if this were a world-wide phenomena, then there'd suddenly become a huge market for products that make people sneeze and I think this would be a hilarious world to live in.
Women in age gap relationships, how has your relationship progressed over the years?	I am 20 and my boyfriend is 30. Our relationship seems like a dream sometimes because of how great it is! He is so kind and loving, I love the shit out of him. We communicate really well which is hard to find it feels like and we both are happiest just snuggled up next to each other doing nothing. He tells me that he would've never guessed that I was so young because apparently I don't act it which is an important aspect I suppose.	It never worked out for me if we were in different life stages when it began. My husband is 7 years older than me, but we met when we were 28 and 35 and in the same life stages/meeting as equals which has worked out great for us.
What is scarier; the existence of aliens, or the inexistence of aliens?	Hardly matters either way. If other life forms exist, we'll never see them. If they don't, we'll never know. Distances are too vast, physics is physics. In a hundred years earth will be a wasteland w/o the resources to support an advanced technological society, so we ain't going even to Mars, much less outside the solar system.	"Scarier"? I'd say the existence of aliens, The inexistence is more of an existential fear, but not a real threat. Whereas life on other planets is a series of unknowns that could be potential threats. But I do think the inexistence of aliens would be a lot sadder.
What are your tips for asking a girl out?	Usually I just sniff my anus at a 45 degree angle, making sure to confer with my friends on the acidity of the smell, if it checks out then I grease my hair back, take two steps forward, three steps back, and ask the girl out while tipping my fedora and saying, "M'lady"	* Use the word DATE unless you want to always wonder if she thinks its a date or just a hang out. End the confusion before it begins. * Have a specific time and date in mind. Don't just leave it out there. "Hey, I'd like to take you on a date to {place} this Friday. It'll be fun!"
What do you cook for a date?	TFW I can only make frozen food So anything frozen that's delicious And LMAO at OP > "What do you want to eat?" > "I don't know whatever you want is fine." TFW I no longer get that because foreveralone	Something light so I don't feel like a cow if we bone. Maybe fish, veggies, pasta (no cream sauce). White wine.
What are your thoughts on Lolita?	It is my life's ambition to re-imagine it as a zombie survival story. I think it fits the genre quite nicely. EDIT: WELL THEN. WAY TO SPIT ON MY AWESOME DREAMS.	Nabokov is a brilliant fucking writer, and I love *Lolita*, despite how hard and unsettling some of it can be to read. He's one of my favorite Russian authors.
Anyone else excited at the prospect of being a dad one day?	Just started working on trying for a kid this month. I could not be more excited. I did not meet my wife until my late 30s and was beginning to think it was never going to happen. But after years of rejection, and shitty dates, I met my wife. Then I had to wait 2 years for her to graduate school and now that I just turned 40 we are finally ready. I cant wait. I love my niece and nephew more than anything and cant wait to have kids of my own. I try to play it cool with my wife (so I don't stress her out) but at this point I think I want kids more than her. My secret hope is that she can get pregnant and have our kid before my father dies (terminal brain cancer) so he can at least get to meet my kid.	Definitely. Or rather, I did feel that way many years ago, hence my having two daughters now. And yeah, it's pretty awesome. It's not always fun, but it's always interesting, and my kids are pretty entertaining, along with being actual people now (at 9 and 11), so we can relate to each other, have long discussions, play videogames together, etc.
BF pees the bed. How not normal is this ?	One of my good buddies still wets the bed. He's turning 26 right away. Especially when he's drunk. His fiance is fucking gorgeous. So was his last girlfriend. I've heard them both complain about it, but they love him and basically just deal with it. He doesn't even hide it. Everyone knows it happens to him.	Something's off with him, either physiological or psychological. Has he seen any docs about this issue? It is definitely not normal.
What made you realize you'd fallen out of love?	(guy here) WOW. I think every man alive should read this thread and learn what NOT to do. It is like a goldmine of self-improvement for men.	When we would hangout, I would wish we weren't and that I was doing something else. It just wasn't.. fun anymore. It was boring, but in the way a lecture class is or a long car ride with no music. My current relationship is predictable, but it isn't dull. We have a lot of laughs and talks. It's very stable and safe. The one before it sucked. It just seemed drawn out. Thinking about being apart didn't bother me.
Are "separate bills" tacky or the norm now when dining with friends?	I think separate bills is totally tacky. Just split the difference, any minor differences can be sorted out in tips. It all works itself out in the end amongst friends	Cash is too much of a hassle so yeah separate bills. It also makes more sense seeing as people order different things at varying price points. Salad and bud light for one person while the other gets a filet and top shelf manhattan etc
Men of Reddit, what are the biggest regrets you have during your time in college?	I wish i fucked more girls and got better grades. I finally got accepted to grad school, but it took 3 applications.	- Too much binge drinking, not enough real socializing. - Should have gotten in shape physically. There's all kinds of classes and facilities available to try different things. - I didn't take classwork seriously enough. You can follow the syllabus and get a degree, but there's tons of opportunity to take part in various research projects etc that will be way more valuable in your career.
What downvoted comment you have written do you stand by 100%?	I said that we should outlaw elective abortions that are not performed for medical reasons. That and the following discussion got me a flurry of downvotes.	Buying someone Omaha Steaks is a decent gift for someone who loves meat. Buying someone twelve pounds of Wagyu from Costco for $900 is fucking ridiculous.
Fellas, what's the most obvious sign from a girl that you missed?	Picture me at a frat party. This is before the new rape bullshit, so two drunk people could fuck without it being rape. We are talking about how good life is, she leans in for a kiss, I boop her on the nose, with my finger. Literally saying the word boop. I don't really remember much after that, but I woke up alone.	She was backing upto me in bed while we were watching Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. I ignored the fuck outta her because the only horn that was getting blown was the Horn of Helm Hammerhand and nobody was interrupting that. My facebook group chat name is two towers now since my friends found out.
What should men do when ladies cry in front of them?	The same thing he should when a woman does anything else. Mind his own business and leave her the hell alone unless she asks for his input.	In my opinion (and this applies to women too): * Offer them a tissue. * If you know them well enough, sit beside them and maybe put an arm around them. * When they're done crying, offer help, a listening ear or to forget that it ever happened.
Guys, Why Do We Make Grunting Noises When We Pick Ourselves Up?	Because you're out of shape. The grunting noise you make when getting out of a chair is a minor version of the noise fit guys make when deadlifting. Start making that noise while deadlifting, and you'll stop making it when you stand up.	It's an expression of disappointment at the fact that we were comfortable in some way and now have to move. It's not aimed at anybody other than the universe.
Black woman living outside the U.S what struggles do you face??	By black women do you mean African American? Or any? Edit: America is pretty much the only place I’ve heard “the angry black woman stereotype”. I’m British and there’s a lot of diversity, we don’t talk about race that often as you lot do in US. Also, I never said racism doesn’t exist in UK. But it certainly can’t be compared to that of US.	I'm a black Jamaican woman, living on the island. Racism isn't the problem here, but colourism is! Many older folks will tell stories of being overlooked for some jobs because of being of a darker hue than others. 'Fairer' complected women were employed in the 'high-visibility' areas such as Banking, Hotel Front Desk Staff, many other Private Sector positions and even as flight attendants on the then national airline. Nowadays, the skin- bleaching phenomenon is so prevalent here, with many people actually believing the fairer the skin, the more attractive. Thankfully, most women and men, still find black skin beautiful.
How important are political beliefs to you when trying to find a girlfriend?	I honestly don't give a fuck about politics, but I could never date a girl that doesn't like guns. Unfortunately, that essentially excludes me from dating 99% of Democrats.	So you're saying you want to seize his means of production OP? In any case I don't really care as long as you're not an extremist on either end of the spectrum and can have a discussion about politics without getting mad.

Men, I just found out I'm going to be a father. What's your best parenting advice?	For the first couple months, Mom needs a chance to recover and should be mostly bed-ridden. Most countries other than the US do this. Arrange for family to help as much as possible during this period, and much more than seems normal. I'm assuming you are from US. She'll be much better off for the rest of the first couple years and will be at much lower risk of PPD. Also, read to the kid every day, even in the womb.	Pay attention to all the baby tips you're about to get, but honestly the most important thing right now is nurturing your relationship with your wife. Keep each other as your #1s and stay a team. That alone can make or break those first few weeks, and those first few weeks WILL make or break the future.
What's the most disappointing sexual experience you've ever had?	I was in a student house and was about to have sex with this guy I really liked and it wouldn't go in and then someone knocked on the door...	Met this guy in a club about 5 years back. Went up to his hotel room and started getting into it. He was fucking me from behind and was holding my head into the pillow. I turn my head to look back at him and he was recording it on his cell phone. No warning and never asked me if he could do that. Naturally, I freaked the fuck out and grabbed his phone and went through the pictures/videos and deleted everything as well as my number.
Women who have had abortions, how did you feel afterwards about the man who got you pregnant?	I have had 2. The first guy I resented definitely, but not because of that. He was just generally a bad person and no way could I ever have a baby with him, he was abusive. The second one, I do resent him, but it's really not his fault. I never told him anything about it, so my resentment is totally unfounded. Just a product of my own emotions, I guess.	We're engaged (and got engaged afterwards), so obviously it didn't change much about our relationship. He was extremely supportive and very hard on himself about it all. I don't blame him at all, and if anything, he definitely showed me he can be relied on in a crisis. It made us closer if anything.
Thrifty brides of AskWomen, what are you glad you scrimped and splurged on, and what would you do differently if you had your time again?	Honestly? If I could go back in time and do it all again, I'd elope. I truly would. All that money we spent, and today, 20 years later, it literally makes me sick to my stomach to think of. I love my husband and the life we have, but it has absolutely nothing to do with a wedding. My advice is to save your money and just have a meaningful little ceremony with just you and him and your two best friends. Then let your families throw you a party if they want to. Years down the road you will thank yourselves.	We splurged on photography, food and drinks. Totally, totally worth it. If anything I would have had a bit less food. We saved on flowers- my mom and I grew them ourselves, and paid a friend of the family to help us make bouquets and centrepieces for the day. That was actually one of the funnest parts of prepping the wedding to me. And we saved a lot of cash on it, which was how we were able to pay for the photography.
AskMen, how did you become friends with your best friend/closest friend?	We were both young working at retail, and wanted a designated driver when he went to the club. I was 18, he is 24. So I went and realized they let me in with a special band. Well, long story short, he's ugly and the chicks hit on me more.	We met in English class 9th grade. He turned back to me and said, "Hey, you're Asian. Do you like video games?" I did.
What's something that you listen to your SO talk about but don't really care?	Seriously, all you ladies out there that listen to your SO's IT/tech ramblings, y'all are the BEST. I work as a Linux Administrator and being able to explain something to her to help me understand helps so much. She's so patient with me and I always return the favor by listening her talk about makup!	He's a bartender. I don't drink. Sometimes he talks about certain beers or wines, and I just cannot for the life of me relate to his interest. But I like to see him happy about things, so I listen and try to understand.
I'm getting married next year. My fiancé's family is much more financially secure than mine. Now they want to buy her a house. Guys that have been in similar situations, how have you dealt with it?	1. Sign the pre-nup. Be a bigger man, don't go after the house, let it stay separate, 2. Take the house, use the rent-free living to fill up your OWN (NOT just your wife's or your shared) account, 3. Have fun doing fun stuff, 4. Her family might use that house to have some influence in your life, which isn't a big deal. Given you are getting a free house to live in!	Your plan sounds quality - use the house as a way to save your money and investments while you live mortgage-free and save up to buy something together. When it comes time, sell the house. You have an opportunity not to be burdened with debt. Take it.
Why does it seem like height is so important to women in the real world, but on Reddit not a single girl cares?	I am one of those women who will only date guys 6' and up. Sorry not sorry. Shortness is uggggly. To be honest it short males just don't seem like they can protect me like a tall guy can. You may be the greatest guy in the world but I'm still not gonna let you touch me. A for your question: I think a lot of women here lie because they simply feel bad for having shallow preferences. Stereotypically women are "supposed" to care a lot about personality and shit, so the height thing doesn't play into this narrative. No woman wants to be seen as a shallow bitch, which is what she'll be called if she talks about hard height limits.	What I've seen really often is a woman saying "she doesn't mind if a guy is short" and following it up with the implication that he still needs to be close to as tall or taller than them. But since they're saying 5'8 is okay at a height of 5'6 themselves, "I don't mind short". Plus, there's a tendency on the internet for people to post feel-good responses that let them avoid even the implication that they're being shallow. Some women would never say "I couldn't date short" to a guy who was actually *asking* if being short was a problem - they'd only say it to people who were taller than them or women.
Who are your favorite female musicians?	In no particular order:, except that Taylor Swift is my favorite artist, period. After Taylor: * Ke$ha * Rachel Platten * Maddie and Tae * Lindsey Stirling * Avril Lavigne (guilty pleasure) * Kacey Musgraves Others I can't think of off the top of my head	Metric is fronted by Emily Haines. Most everything they has done is incredible but my favorite songs are "Raw Sugar" and "Gold Gun Girls."
Men, if a girl were to take you on a picnic, what kind of foods would you be excited to see that she brought?	Picnics are lame, when planned. When done in a surprisng way, they are awesome. You gotta do it right. Example: I surprised my girlfriend (now wife) with a picnic. But, more like an ambush. It was a beautiful day. At the time, I had a gorgeous 300ZX (T-Tops FTW). So I packed a few basic sandwiches, drinks, vase and a few flowers in a bag. I then waited at the exit of her work. So when she and her coworkers walked out, boom, there I am, picking her up in a cool pseudo-convertible sports car, and whisked her away to a nearby National Park, and had the picnic. The food was irrelevant. It was the thought behind the gesture, the surprise, compounded by the jealously of her coworkers.	all you need is some wine and bread, with some meat and cheese to go with them. > Are picnics lame? how good is the view and how private is the place? I can't see an urban greenspace full of parents chasing their little kids being much fun.
What are the biggest mistakes writers make when trying to write an empowering female character?	Patting their own backs about it, especially when part of the character description is "strong female role model." Give me more women like Anita Blake--hardened warriors who will kill you as soon as look at you and who give literally no fucks at all about pleasing other people, but who have a moral code that they stick to and are protective of and loyal to their friends. God, I loved that woman before she went full-on porn.	Portraying her as not having any weaknesses. It's unrealistic to have this "strong, independent woman" ONLY be strong and independent. Strong women have flaws just like anyone else.
Why is dating so complicated in America?	From an American perspective, I find it weird that Europeans tend to be "together" after a week of knowing each other. I prefer the American way of going to dinner a couple of times before you decide if you want to be exclusive.	In Norway we tend to have sex first and then try and find out if maybe we want to spend time in the vicinity of eachother in a normal setting.
Guys of Reddit, what question do you wanna ask other guys?	This is a great thread seeing how I'm banned from creating new ones from this sub for some reason (oops). Why am I only attracted to skanks? Last few girls I've been interested have turned out horribly, one getting finger banged by a friend behind a water tower, another I dated an ex-con after me and turned to a life of drugs, and another girl I'm interested in turned out to be a stripper. I've been on dates with "normal" girls but it just seems boring. They have their shit together but there's no excitement or attraction. My brain says GO FOR THIS ONE! But my dick says no. And my heart is dead due to failed previous relationships.	Never mind I just realized this is what the entire subreddit is. Edit: what the fuck guys? I said nevermind.
From AskWomen: What things does your SO do that you aren't crazy about, but they aren't deal breakers so you just "let them go"?	So, this is a terrible example, but here we go. Whenever my girlfriend and I have sex, she wants to give me head. EVERY. TIME. I'm one of those folks that just don't get much enjoyment from receiving, but she's into it, so I go with it. I know..terrible problem to have.	She's gotten much better about this, but still happens on occasion: She takes ideas to do things and books me into her plans without consulting me on if I had my own plans for my free time. Then she's the first one to quit because it's not as she imagined. She also doesn't bring the recycling bin back in when she gets them from the road, instead she leaves it outside on the deck and piles both the cardboard and the metal/glass into the one other bin for me to sort through on my own if I don't catch it right away. I'm sure she'd have a *much* longer list about me.
What are your thoughts on asymmetrical boobs?	Is one a totally different cup size? If not they're not really asymmetrical. I guess you haven't seen that many IRL women's boobs but most are not exactly identical. Maybe ask some girlfriends to see theirs and you'll feel better.	No boobs are completely symmetrical. Unless one is ***very,*** ***very*** different from the other, we usually won't notice. And even if we do, we usually won't care. A guy would have to be pretty dumb to be at the point of having sex with a girl, and then be wigged out just because she's a human being.
What are some unwritten "Lady Laws"?	Don't mess with another women's SO, or even an ex bf. If you and me are friends and you're trying to hit on my ex. That's a big No No to me.	Thou shalt pretend you know that girl at the bar who is giving anyone and everyone the pleading eyes when some creepy dude is scamming on her and save her.
What does your seemingly normal SO do that makes you wonder if they might actually be a complete idiot and you’ve been duped?	I had an ex who was a veterinarian. She and one of colleagues got into all that quackery when overnight everyone suddenly became gluten and lactose intolerant. She had some allergy test done, which said she was "allergic to dairy products". Bearing in mind she'd grown up on a dairy farm and was a veterinarian, it took wayyy too long to convince her that eggs are not dairy products... All I wanted was a fry-up for breakfast. We went out for lunch.	To flip this slightly, my wife watched me wrap a couple presents this weekend and asked if I was having a stroke
How would you like to be approached by another woman? Or how do you flirt with other women?	there's a beautiful girl i like, i'd want her to turn to me in class, (i sit next to her a lot) and ask how my day was, ask if i want to go out sometime, i give her my socials ......very basic	I usually compliment her and say that I mean the compliment but I'm also totally hitting on her. I usually add that it's fine if women aren't her thing but she is so beautiful that I'd be kicking myself if I didn't at least try to ask her out.
How do you learn to accept that a relationship is over, and they're never coming back?	If the person unequivocally told you it was over, then you do not want to run the risk of having a personal order of protection against you. Also, think about this: why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you?	You've got to realize a couple of things and take them to heart. 1. They don't want to be with you. 2. You don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you. 3. Forgive them for not being the person you wanted them to be.
I'm a former fattie female and despite lots of exercise, my body looks very bad. How do you gentleman suggest I go about dating?	At the risk of giving cliché and potentially eye-rolling advice, I'd say *just keep trying.* Maybe go out on more dates, having more direct and intimate discussions about your body insecurities, and what you're looking for, early on? (All at being said not knowing what you're currently doing.) And I'd second the recommendation of saving up for surgery as a gift to yourself for your hard work. What the hell is money worth if we don't utilize it for our own happiness? You already sound like you have great confidence in who you are. There's no reason to deprive yourself of feeling good about your body, too. Edit typos	The best way to meet the most compatible partner is meet as many men as you can. Online dating is the best way to do that. The dating game is rough. You're going to have to wade through a lot of incompatible people like everyone else.
Anyone have those dreams that a so real you really don't want to wake up?	I used to have those all the time! But now since I have class at 8 AM IN THE FUCKING MORNING (I'm about to leave now) I can't continue dreaming. I do on the weekends though..and I do stay 'asleep' as long as I can to like try to get to a conclusion of the dream.	Yes, I have those occasionally. Sometimes they're about loved ones who have died, and I feel heartbroken when I wake up. On the flip side, I also occasionally have some awful nightmares, and I get to wake up from those thinking "Whew -- so I *don't* have a wasting plague that's making my teeth fall out while all my junior high school crushes point and laugh at me. It's already shaping up to be a good day!" Everything has its silver linings, I guess. :)
How did your worst date go? What was the experience like?	I’m a female reading these to make sure none of them are about me 😂 but for real tho, let’s have a girl version of these. We have it worse. I guarantee it.	There’s several that come to mind. Went on one where she was txting with her ex the whole time. I paid. No second date. Went on a date with another chick who was more interested in Facebook than me. If they reach for their phone more than twice without good cause, I’m gone. I will no longer inconvenience myself.
If you could submit ONE support ticket to your body, what would it say?	Dear Bodies R Us Customer Support, I recently purchased 1x Female Body from your store. Unfortunately, what has arrived is your other product, "Male Body". As a woman, this body is clearly not fit for purpose. Could you please send me the correct model, I would be happy to return the one you sent me provided you reimburse me for any reasonable costs incurred doing so. Kind regards, /u/cuddlegoop	Dear Body Support Staff, I am experiencing an issue in which my body seems to think eating a box of Nerds is an acceptable replacement for dinner. Do you have any idea what is causing this bug or how I can fix it? Thank you for your time, /u/fishielicious
What's the most hurtful thing anyone has ever said to you?	Years ago I dated this guy who was incapable of expressing affection or initiating sex or looking me in the eye and thought that buying me expensive gifts and insisting on paying for everything would compensate for that. Years later his best friend, who I *thought* was also my friend, called me a gold digger. Repeatedly. The real kicker was that there was a time when I had all the intention, drive and motivation in the world to go out and get the six figure salary necessary to support my ex's lofty creative delusions. Kind of embarrassing for me to admit now, really.	When I was 13, it was a thing to have your phone number in your status on MSN. I didn't have any friends but as a 13 year old, I was trying to fit in, so I put mine in my status. One girl's display name had a bunch of different people's names in it, indicating that she was having a party. I got a message from them saying, "omg LOL who the fuck would want to call you???? :D:D:D". I started crying and just said "i don't know" and removed it from my status. It was hurtful because it was true, I had no friends, and no one who would want to call me. Someone pointing it out was humiliating. The girl was a bridesmaid at a wedding I attended last year and it stirred up a lot of bad emotions.
What do you think that women nowadays are too critical of men for? Why?	Because we don't treat women like we used too. They've always been critical and always will, it's us that perceives.	Feelings and maturity. I've had girls tell me they've dumped guys because they started to get too "emotional" and would cry about some pretty deep shit. That's not cool. I hate that perception that dudes can't cry and shit. Maturity as in that apparently now that I'm 23 years old it means I shouldn't be playing video games, love LOTR, or watching anime, but doing stuff like "adventuring, hiking, etc." I may be grown now with a job, etc., but in my eyes it's like I have the money to afford the things I never could as a kid. It's my chance to have the fun I wanted. I still go out, work out at the gym, and so-on so fuck anyone who judges how I spend my extra free time.
My girlfriend seems to love attention from other guys. Is this normal? Harmless?	I'm really curious as to why her number of sexual partners / *kissing* partners (are we 16?) are remotely involved in this. You should edit that info out, it's irrelevant and I immediately assumed you were a controlling D-bag.	If it's making you feel uncomfortable, she knows that it makes you feel uncomfortable, and she continues to do it...it's not harmless. That's immature, and disrespectful. If she feels like she has to hide things from you, that's cheating. Period. Let her know you don't like her flirting, "harmless" or not, and if she continues, dump her. She can apologize until her lips fall off, but it's obviously not genuine if she keeps doing it. Actions are stronger than words, and this is a fine example. I wouldn't put up with any more if I were you. *ninja edit* >Some girl friends of mine told me that a little flirting is harmless True, flirting here and there is just human nature. However... >has told me she's gotten numbers, but not who from, to get a rise out of me when she hasn't. Not okay.
Do you think it's important for young people to travel? Why or why not?	Honestly, I don't see the point in it at this age other than fun. And you can have every bit as much fun locally if you're creative and have a good group of friends. I want to settle down though so I may represent an odd stance.	Your 20s is probably the best time for you to travel, because you (probably) don't have to worry about your spouse and children. You can travel alone or with a group of friends, spend money on whatever fancies you and do pretty much whatever you want.
Men of Reddit, what would you do if your best friend sexually assaulted you gf?	Y'all ignoring the obvious here. You're with this guy..and his BEST friend is a sexual predator?! Whatever happened to "show me your friends and I'll tell u who you're..?" This is his best friend! He picked him! Their relationship is longer than yours. If I were you I'd audit what I have with this guy. Good luck	That mf’er would no longer be my friend. There would be a confrontation and I don’t know how it would go down, but it’s happening. In no way would my relationship with her change because of this. Hope you’re okay. Nobody deserves that shit.
r/AskMen - Men who lost their sexual attraction to their SO... Why? Did you try to rekindle it, and did it work out? If not, what happened with your relationship?	Had 2 babies. Saw them both come out. Could never see 'it' the same way. My problem not hers but that's life.	My partner became too dependent on me. We lost our individuality. I really think sexual attraction stems from this idea of "separateness." When you first start dating, that person is still "other." You find them mysterious, independent, etc. But eventually you melt together into an unsexy blob. We're really intimate ALL the time, but never erotic. Trying to make it work currently. Trying to become two again, so we can enjoy becoming one. EDIT: wow thank you for the gold. I'm extremely honored.
What is something (significant or silly) that all of your exes seem to have in common?	Throwin in my 2 cents- I seem to end up with busty blonde artists that have Elizabeth somewhere in their name. Weird thing is, I'm generally more attracted to technically inclined brunettes. Dunno why the opposite keeps happening.	Ok this is really weird but I was thinking about this exact question a few months ago and I have never dated anyone with divorced parents. I really don't have a physical type and they are as different as can be in terms of personality, but all of their parents are still together.
What do you think of women who enter the men's restroom because the line for the women's restroom is too long?	It's largely "meh". The double standard is mildly annoying, as is the idea that they're making the l*ines in the mens room* longer by their actions. But neither of those things is really enough to get all bent out of shape about. And let's be honest: this almost exclusively happens at bars, concerts or sporting events where people are drinking alcohol. And If I'm there with a girl, I want her to come back to the table/seat faster so we can have more fun, right? So whatever works.	Call me crazy, but I'm against it. I don't personally have a problem with a woman in the men's restroom, but it's unfair to those who may be uncomfortable with it. People deserve to be able to use the restroom in public comfortably (relatively speaking).
How many of you would consider adoption over giving birth (if you want kids)?	I want to have my own kids. I'm biracial and I'm in a relationship with a white guy and 3/4 white 1/4 black kids are kind of rare so I want to contribute to diversity.	That was my preference. We ended up having our own after going through several agencies and learning we were looking at ten years and piles upon piles upon piles of money before we even got a child. Having your own is far cheaper. Realize though that adopting and having your own are vastly different experiences, from start to finish. And no one should be guilted for recognizing that adopting a child with genetics that aren't yours and a possible slew of issues is far different than starting from zero with your own.
Your girl posts your personal relationship problems on social media. What do you do?	I post question on reddit to discuss said personal relationship problems about my girls posting personal relationship problems on social media, of course.	That's a big no no for me. Social media isn't an excuse to air private matters out to the world. I think it is fair to have a conversation with her explaining that social media is not to be used to share intimate details, relationship problems, or seek advice on such things. If she wants to talk about relationship issues with someone else, she can pick up the phone and call her best friend. If she continues to do so, you won't ever feel safe confiding in her or sharing personal details. That's pretty much terminal to a relationship.
Would you tell a girl why you're rejecting her if you reject her?	In person, probably wouldn't. In real life I'd probably just say "Thanks but I'm not interested." If she pressed me for an answer I might oblige. "Your boobs are too small" is an unlikely scenario in my case, but I could say something like "I'm not a fan of too much cellulite" or something like that.	Depends on the reason. If I'm not attracted physically I'll just say I'm not interested. If it's a personality issue I'd tell her we don't seem compatible.
What is the nicest thing a girl has ever said to you?	wow.. uh. judging by the comments in this thread I'm apparently really, really, really well off when it comes to compliments from women/girls. I've been told stuff like "you're so calming to be around" or "seeing you has just brightened my day" or "I love talking to you because you're so honest and understanding". honestly.. now I'm almost worried that I may perhaps have been looking like a big, helpless, puppy or sth to most of these women.	Got told by a friend that I'm one of the nicest and most genuine people she knows. This was months ago and it still makes me warm and fuzzy when I think about it
Do you ever crave sex with another woman, even though you still deeply love your SO?	As a female I really don't think you needing to "spread your seed" is an asshole feeling. It's what our species relies on. If my SO didn't think about having sex with other women I would honestly be worried. I would rather he spoke to me about it but if it was just sex then I would probably be okay with it. Also sex doesn't = love, it's just a part of it.	Wanting to do something never makes you an asshole. What you do is what defines you, not what you think. I personally want to brutally murder most people I see on a day to day basis but I don't, that doesn't make me a sociopath. You're fine, just don't cheat on her and you're doing the right thing.
Mod PSA: So this totally "crazy" thing happened to me which I really want to talk/brag/rant about, but I have to ask a question or else the nazi mods will pull my post so how's your day going?	**I** think it's fair to say that **just** because people say something with a **slew** of crap ahead of the question doesn't mean that we shouldn't give them **three** chances before we know they're **rogues** or a complete karma whore. **With my** example above, their posts' karma might be **12+**. It's only if it generates negative comments that we as mods need to cut the post down with our **broadsword of Winterholm**. .......but enough about that, Koala, how's your day going?	**I** think it's fair to say that **just** because people say something with a **slew** of crap ahead of the question doesn't mean that we shouldn't give them **three** chances before we know they're **rogues** or a complete karma whore. **With my** example above, their posts' karma might be **12+**. It's only if it generates negative comments that we as mods need to cut the post down with our **broadsword of Winterholm**. .......but enough about that, Koala, how's your day going?
What are your thoughts on femdom ?	It's a huge turn off for me and a deal breaker for any man who wants to sleep with me, but I don't really give a fuck what other people do.	Love it in real life but hate the porn. Maybe it was coincidence but none of the stuff I find online while looking for ideas does it for me. I guess it's because I'm into a gentler dom, and I don't really like a lot of humiliation or a lot of torture.
Men of reddit, how was your high school experience like? Was it truly the best time of your life?	College= best time of your life. Unless you go to college in your "hometown". College helped me develop into the person I am. Once you leave the nest and expand your comfort zone, it really leads to amazing things some bad some good but overall amazing.	It was fine. The more I look back the more I realize how unimportant it was. Went through typical teenage depression and drama, had a handful of friends until they all went balls deep into the party life. But looking back as a 25 year old now... It wasn't the best time or worst time... Just a time. No need to feel empty due to it not being everything you wanted, because you still have like 60 years of life ahead of you. We're still young, OP. No need to long for the time when we were kids. Edit: though I'll admit, I am looking forward to a 10 year reunion, should we have one.
What is something you often hear women say they want in a man, but you think they wouldn't like if they actually got it?	A good man. The good guys end up timid, unskilled, inexperienced and respectful with a so-so job. The not so good have the skills and initiative and force of personality to get what they want, which is, laid, with a more high-status job. Or the hottie wife.	"Treat me the same as you do your guy friends." Begged me to stop the next day, didn't realize how much special treatment she was getting as a girlfriend.
What is your worst story of "good person" is actually trash in a relationship?	My bf - or now ex as of an hour ago - is the most liked person everywhere. He seems like such a good person on the surface. So kind and caring. All he cares about is himself and not feeling bad though. He just broke up with me after booking a holiday to go meet his mum in France. After postponing us moving in together bc he wasn't ready yet but definitely wanted to. We were going to Japan for Christmas. I met all of his family last Christmas 6 months into dating. I'm sorry, I'm very distressed rn	I had this friend, her husband was abusive, but nobody believe her at first because in public he was this amazing guy everyone was crazy about him, It took a trip to the emergency room with all her ribs broken to people realize it was an act, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw her there he destroyed her face, he had the guts to say that she threw herself down stairs to blame him . The officer who arrested him said: oh really? how many times she did it.
How do you feel about men in women subreddits or women in the men subreddits asking or posting ?	I think it's good. Sometimes men can have some pretty interesting insights when it comes to questions regarding women. In general though, I think women should be the primary respondents.	Solely considering "ask" subreddits: Posting? no problem at all. doesn't matter who posts questions. Commenting? That's a different thing. If the majority of responeses to a question on r/askWOMEN are from men, then that defeats the purpose of the sub. Same the other way around.
Do any of yall only air dry your hair?	Yup I NEVER blow dry my hair unless I'm going to a super fancy event (so once-twice a year max at the moment). My blowdryer only works 30% of the time and I don't care enough to replace it. Not a tomboy, tonnes of female friends. Just very low maintenance.	I have curly hair, hair dryers are the devil. My hair instantly turns into one clump of frizzy nastiness if I use a blow dryer.
Guys that get the feeling that a girl isn't interested, but hasn't gotten a direct response where she says so, what's your approach? Did you ever get a confirmation?	Bite the bullet, ask directly. The grey area is the worst, and it's not like asking her is going to reduce her opinion of you. Either she is and was willing, and you succeed, or she isn't and you move on to others. Don't let ambiguity disqualify yourself but equally do not waste time hoping to charm someone who isn't reciprocating.	>didn't offer to reschedule. I read that as, "Not interested. Move on." If she was interested AND at able/willing to initiate (both requirements for me), she'd have offered an alternate time or option. Or even invited you to ask after X date. So, either she's uninterested, or expecting you to do all the planning and pursuing. Either way, dude, pass.
Married Men of Reddit, How do deal with morning wood while in bed with your wife/husband?	I just slide it inside of her. Edit: for those of you down voting, I know you're thinking RAPE and that says more about you. My wife and I discussed this very thing and she agreed/consented to no consent needed and so did I. Yes it goes both ways if she finds me sleeping with a hard dick she can just jump on it and I have no problem with that. My wife and I are both consenting adults that know what we want and understand this does not fall under rape as we both consented to this system.	I’m confused. Are you asking if we’re embarrassed to have a boner around our wife? If I have one in the morning I usually pee it out or ask her to fuck if she’s up for it. Morning sex is just as good
Why did she fall out of love with you?	I was too beta. Poor frame, didn't lift heavy enough, too chubby and short, severe oneitis, and mistakenly believed I could turn a ho into a housewife.	It's less that she fell out of love with me, and more that while I was gone for work, someone else was around, and she fell in love with him.

Women of AskMen, what is the most interesting fact you've learned from reading AskMen?	That men harbor some pretty deep resentment against women. Other users here talked about how insecure many men are, but that doesn't surprise me. People are generally insecure, especially young people. The difference is women will hate and blame themselves, or in a more critical evaluation "society", but men will blame women for feeling like shit about themselves.	I didn't realize how much a woman initiating sex with her SO meant to so many men. I've been making a conscious effort to make sure my guy feels wanted as much as he does that for me after reading posts here.
As a guy, I can detect assholes from miles away and in seconds. So...ladies who keep ending up with assholes - are your radars really that bad or do the benefits(confidence) really outweigh the costs?	It's not a radar thing. It's genetic. The most confident guy is the one people attach to. Sometimes they turn out to be assholes, sometimes not, but it's usually the leader of the pack, rather than someone who's really nice, but not an alpha.	I'll start out by saying it boils down to having a bad radar. BUT assholes are really good at being really nice to women at first. You don't see them in private with us--and you probably would never guess how cool and sweet some "assholes" can be. It throws off the radar.
